Every year the city hosts the [[East Coast Surfing Championships]] as well as the North American Sand Soccer Championship, a [[beach soccer]] tournament. It is also home to several state parks, several long-protected beach areas, three military bases, a number of large corporations, [[Virginia Wesleyan University]] and [[Regent University]], the international headquarters and site of the television broadcast studios for [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), [[Edgar Cayce]]'s [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]], and numerous historic sites. Near the point where the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean meet, [[Cape Henry]] was the site of the [[First Landing State Park|first landing]] of the English colonists, who eventually settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], on April 26, 1607.\n\nThe city is listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as having the longest pleasure beach in the world.

They named it Cape Henry, after [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of King [[James I of England]]. These English colonists of the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]] moved on from this area, as they were under orders to seek a site further inland, which would be more sheltered from ships of competing European countries.

At the age of 18, he had contracted as an [[indentured servant]] to pay for passage to the [[Virginia Colony]] in the hopes of bettering his life. He earned his freedom after several years and became a leading citizen of the area. In 1629, he was elected to the [[House of Burgesses]] for [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] {{sic}}, one of four \"citties\" (or incorporations) which were subdivided areas established in 1619.<ref name = \"Norfolk History Chapter 4\"/>\n\nIn 1634, the Colony was divided into the original eight [[shires of Virginia]], soon renamed as [[county|counties]]. Thoroughgood is credited with using the name of his home in England when helping name \"[[New Norfolk County]]\" in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into [[Upper Norfolk County]] (soon renamed [[Nansemond County, Virginia|Nansemond County]]) and [[Lower Norfolk County]]. Thoroughgood resided after 1634 was along the [[Lynnhaven River]], named for his home in England.\n\nLower Norfolk County was large when first organized, defined as from the Atlantic Ocean west past the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], encompassing the entire area now within the modern cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 4\">{{cite web | url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html | title = The Origins of Norfolk's Name | accessdate = October 9, 2007 | publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref> It attracted many entrepreneurs, including William Moseley with his family in 1648. Belonging to the [[Merchant Adventurers Guild of London]], he immigrated from [[Rotterdam]] of the [[Netherlands]], where he had been in the international trade. He settled on land on the north side of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], east of what developed as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].\n\nFollowing increased settlement, in 1691 Lower Norfolk County was divided to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] counties. Princess Anne, the easternmost county in South Hampton Roads, extended from Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, south to what became the border of the North Carolina colony. It included all of the area fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Princess Anne County was known as a jurisdiction from 1691 to 1963, over 250 years.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 9\">{{cite web | url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html | title = Norfolk Becomes a Borough | accessdate = October 9, 2007 | publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref>\n[[File:Virginia Beach - panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|Hotels along Atlantic Avenue, facing north]]\nIn the early centuries, this area was rural and developed for plantation agriculture. In the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach developed in Princess Anne County after the 1883 arrival of rail service to the coast. The Virginia Beach Hotel was opened and operated by the Norfolk and Virginia Beach Railroad and Improvement Company at the oceanfront, near the tiny community of [[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]]. The hotel was foreclosed and the railroad reorganized in 1887. The hotel was upgraded and reopened in 1888 as the Princess Anne Hotel.<ref>Jonathan Mark Souther, \"Twixt Ocean and Pines: The Seaside Resort at Virginia Beach, 1880-1930.\" M.A. thesis, University of Richmond, 1996.</ref>\n\nIn 1891, guests at the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] for the Norwegian bark ''Dictator''. The ship's figurehead, which washed up on the beach several days later, was erected as a monument to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching [[Norwegian Lady|Norwegian Lady Monuments]], sculpted by [[\u00d8rnulf Bast]] and installed in Virginia Beach and [[Moss, Norway]].<ref>Foss, William O., ''The Norwegian Lady and the Wreck of the Dictator''. Virginia Beach, Virginia: Noreg Books, 2002. {{ISBN|0-9721989-0-3}}</ref>\n\nThe resort initially depended on [[railroad]] and [[electric trolley]] service. The completion of [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] in 1922, which extended from Norfolk to the oceanfront, opened the route for [[automobile]]s, [[bus]]es, and [[truck]]s. The passenger rail service to the oceanfront was eventually discontinued as traffic increased by vehicle. The growing resort of Virginia Beach became an [[incorporated town]] in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach continued to grow in popularity as a seasonal vacation spot. The casinos were replaced by amusement parks and family-oriented attractions. In 1927 The [[Cavalier Hotel]] opened and became a popular vacation spot.\n\nVirginia Beach gained status as an independent city in 1952, although ties remained between it and Princess Anne County. In 1963, after voters in the two jurisdictions passed a supporting referendum, and with the approval of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], the two political subdivisions were consolidated as a new, much larger independent city, retaining the better-known name of the Virginia Beach resort.<ref name=\"Virginia Beach History\">{{cite web | url = https://www.virginiabeach.com/listing/attractions/history | title = Virginia Beach History | accessdate = March 21, 2008 | publisher = VirginiaBeach.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Alan B.

Local public and private groups have maintained a vested interest in real-estate redevelopment, resulting in a number of joint public-private projects, such as commercial parks. Examples of the public-private development include the Virginia Beach Convention Center, the Oceanfront Hilton Hotel, and the [[Virginia Beach Town Center]]. The city assisted in financing the project through the use of tax increment financing: creating special tax districts and constructing associated street and infrastructure to support the developments.  The Town Center opened in 2003, with related construction continuing. The Convention Center opened in 2005.<ref name=\"VBTC Financing\">{{cite web | url = http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextoid=5542340df304c010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextchannel=c803a9893c5dd010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default | title = Town Center | accessdate = March 8, 2007 | publisher = City of Virginia Beach}}</ref><ref name=\"Phase I\">{{cite web | url = http://meetingsnet.com/news/meetings_phase_virginia_beach/ | title = Phase I of Virginia Beach Convention Center Set to Open in June | author = Barbara L.

During [[Hurricane Matthew]], the heavy rainfall flooded over 2000 homes and left some neighbourhood with standing water for days. Given the rising risks of flooding due to [[climate change in Virginia|climate change]] and the impetus of the hurricane damage, the city rejected several further development proposals. This rejection was significant from two perspectives. First, cities reject building very rarely, demonstrating the shift in public perception. Second, these rejections led to lawsuits by the developers. The rejection of these lawsuits in the courts provides precedent for other sorts of local [[climate change adaptation]] efforts in the future.

At the age of 18, he had contracted as an [[indentured servant]] to pay for passage to the [[Virginia Colony]] in the hopes of bettering his life. He earned his freedom after several years and became a leading citizen of the area. In 1629, he was elected to the [[House of Burgesses]] for [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] {{sic}}, one of four \"citties\" (or incorporations) which were subdivided areas established in 1619.<ref name = \"Norfolk History Chapter 4\"/>\n\nIn 1634, the Colony was divided into the original eight [[shires of Virginia]], soon renamed as [[county|counties]]. Thoroughgood is credited with using the name of his home in England when helping name \"[[New Norfolk County]]\" in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into [[Upper Norfolk County]] (soon renamed [[Nansemond County, Virginia|Nansemond County]]) and [[Lower Norfolk County]]. Thoroughgood resided after 1634 was along the [[Lynnhaven River]], named for his home in England.\n\nLower Norfolk County was large when first organized, defined as from the Atlantic Ocean west past the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], encompassing the entire area now within the modern cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 4\">{{cite web | url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html | title = The Origins of Norfolk's Name | accessdate = October 9, 2007 | publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref> It attracted many entrepreneurs, including William Moseley with his family in 1648.

He settled on land on the north side of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], east of what developed as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].\n\nFollowing increased settlement, in 1691 Lower Norfolk County was divided to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] counties. Princess Anne, the easternmost county in South Hampton Roads, extended from Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, south to what became the border of the North Carolina colony. It included all of the area fronting the Atlantic Ocean.

In the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach developed in Princess Anne County after the 1883 arrival of rail service to the coast. The Virginia Beach Hotel was opened and operated by the Norfolk and Virginia Beach Railroad and Improvement Company at the oceanfront, near the tiny community of [[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]]. The hotel was foreclosed and the railroad reorganized in 1887. The hotel was upgraded and reopened in 1888 as the Princess Anne Hotel.<ref>Jonathan Mark Souther, \"Twixt Ocean and Pines: The Seaside Resort at Virginia Beach, 1880-1930.\" M.A. thesis, University of Richmond, 1996.</ref>\n\nIn 1891, guests at the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] for the Norwegian bark ''Dictator''. The ship's figurehead, which washed up on the beach several days later, was erected as a monument to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching [[Norwegian Lady|Norwegian Lady Monuments]], sculpted by [[\u00d8rnulf Bast]] and installed in Virginia Beach and [[Moss, Norway]].<ref>Foss, William O., ''The Norwegian Lady and the Wreck of the Dictator''.

The completion of [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] in 1922, which extended from Norfolk to the oceanfront, opened the route for [[automobile]]s, [[bus]]es, and [[truck]]s. The passenger rail service to the oceanfront was eventually discontinued as traffic increased by vehicle. The growing resort of Virginia Beach became an [[incorporated town]] in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach continued to grow in popularity as a seasonal vacation spot. The casinos were replaced by amusement parks and family-oriented attractions. In 1927 The [[Cavalier Hotel]] opened and became a popular vacation spot.\n\nVirginia Beach gained status as an independent city in 1952, although ties remained between it and Princess Anne County. In 1963, after voters in the two jurisdictions passed a supporting referendum, and with the approval of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], the two political subdivisions were consolidated as a new, much larger independent city, retaining the better-known name of the Virginia Beach resort.<ref name=\"Virginia Beach History\">{{cite web | url = https://www.virginiabeach.com/listing/attractions/history | title = Virginia Beach History | accessdate = March 21, 2008 | publisher = VirginiaBeach.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Alan B.

Local public and private groups have maintained a vested interest in real-estate redevelopment, resulting in a number of joint public-private projects, such as commercial parks. Examples of the public-private development include the Virginia Beach Convention Center, the Oceanfront Hilton Hotel, and the [[Virginia Beach Town Center]]. The city assisted in financing the project through the use of tax increment financing: creating special tax districts and constructing associated street and infrastructure to support the developments.  The Town Center opened in 2003, with related construction continuing. The Convention Center opened in 2005.<ref name=\"VBTC Financing\">{{cite web | url = http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextoid=5542340df304c010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextchannel=c803a9893c5dd010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default | title = Town Center | accessdate = March 8, 2007 | publisher = City of Virginia Beach}}</ref><ref name=\"Phase I\">{{cite web | url = http://meetingsnet.com/news/meetings_phase_virginia_beach/ | title = Phase I of Virginia Beach Convention Center Set to Open in June | author = Barbara L.

During [[Hurricane Matthew]], the heavy rainfall flooded over 2000 homes and left some neighbourhood with standing water for days. Given the rising risks of flooding due to [[climate change in Virginia|climate change]] and the impetus of the hurricane damage, the city rejected several further development proposals. This rejection was significant from two perspectives. First, cities reject building very rarely, demonstrating the shift in public perception. Second, these rejections led to lawsuits by the developers. The rejection of these lawsuits in the courts provides precedent for other sorts of local [[climate change adaptation]] efforts in the future. Discussing the matter, Mayor Dryer noted, \"It\u2019s a confrontation with reality.

The city currently operates under the [[Council\u2013manager government|council\u2013manager form of government]].<ref name = \"City Government Form\"/> The city does not fall under the jurisdiction of a [[county (United States)|county]] government, due to state law. Rather, it functions as an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] and operates as a political subdivision of the state.\n\nThe city's legislative body consists of an eleven-member [[city council]]. The [[city manager]] is appointed by the council and acts as the chief executive officer. Through his staff, he implements policies established by the council.<ref name = \"City Council\"/>\n\nMembers of the city council normally serve four-year terms and are elected on a staggered basis in non-partisan elections. Beginning in 2008, general elections are held the first Tuesday in November in even-numbered years. In previous years, elections were held the first Tuesday in May in even-numbered years. All registered voters are eligible to vote for all council members. Three council members and the [[mayor]] serve on an [[at-large]] basis. All others are elected by district (and must live in the district they represent): Bayside, Beach, Centerville, Kempsville, Lynnhaven, Princess Anne, and Rose Hall.<ref name=\"City Government Form\">{{cite web | url = http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextchannel=f046b4d03baed010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD | title = Virginia Beach City Manager: Form of Government | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | publisher = Virginia Beach City Manager | date = September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe mayor is elected to a four-year term through direct election. The mayor presides over city council meetings, and serves as the ceremonial head and spokesperson of the city. A vice mayor is also elected by the city council at the first meeting following a council election.<ref name=\"City Council\">{{cite web | url = http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextchannel=f046b4d03baed010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD | title = Virginia Beach City Council: About Us | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | publisher = Virginia Beach City Council | date = September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nCitizens of Virginia Beach also elect five constitutional officers, and candidates for these offices are permitted to run with an affiliated political party. Three of these offices deal substantially with public safety and justice: the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], [[commonwealth's attorney]], and the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the [[Virginia Circuit Court|circuit court]]. The two other offices are concerned with fiscal policy: the [[city treasurer]] and the commissioner of the revenue.\n\nVirginia Beach is located entirely in the {{ushr|Virginia|2}}, served by U.S. Representative [[Elaine Luria]] (Democrat).\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Frank W Cox High School.jpg|thumb|right|The current building of Frank W. Cox High School]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census|U.S. Census]], 28.1% of the population over twenty-five (vs. a national average of 24%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher, and 90.4% (vs. 80% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\nPrior to 1969, separate schools were maintained for black and white students. Before 1938, black students who wished to attend school past seventh grade had to travel to Norfolk, and pay tuition to attend [[Booker T. Washington High School (Norfolk, Virginia)|Booker T. Washington High School]]. In 1938, the first high school for blacks, the [[Princess Anne County Training School]] was built. In 1961, in order to avoid the stigma of the term \"training school\", the school was renamed '''Union Kempsville High School''' at the request of the black community. When the public schools integrated in 1969, Union Kempsville was closed.<ref name=\"80 years\">{{cite news | last1 = Harki | first1 = Gary A | title = Eighty years later, students from Virginia Beach's first black high school remember | url = https://pilotonline.com/news/article_a8cea3a0-be9b-11e8-8755-f32bd5a21ec4.html | newspaper = [[The Virginian-Pilot]] | access-date = December 20, 2018 | date = September 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"vtech\">{{cite journal | title = The History of Princess Anne County Training School and Union Kempsville High School Princess Anne County/Virginia Beach, Virginia 1925-1969 | url = https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/19367 | accessdate = December 20, 2018 | date = April 27, 2013 | last1 = Lucas | first1 = Joanne Harris}}</ref><ref name=\"PACTS A & E\">{{cite web | title = princess anne county training school union kempsville high school alumni and friends association, inc. | url = http://www.pacts-ukhs.org/ | accessdate = December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe city of Virginia Beach is home to [[Virginia Beach City Public Schools]], one of the largest school systems in the state (based on student enrollment).

The coexistence of the Celts lasted about two centuries and ended with their assimilation by the numerous Dacians.\n\nThe Dacian settlement in the south of the [[Mic\u0103laca]] district was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] troops between 101 and 102. During the [[Second Dacian War]] (105-106), the Emperor [[Trajan]] conquered territories north of Mure\u015f River, making them part of the [[Roman Dacia]]. In the Aradul Nou area, the Roman army built the fort [[Castra of Aradul Nou]] that housed the legion [[Legio IV Flavia Felix]]. During the period between the 2nd and 4th centuries Dacian and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] settlements were present in the area of today's city, with intense commercial relations with the [[Roman Empire]]. \n\nThe first evidence of [[Slavs|Slavic]] assimilation by [[Proto-Romanians]] appeared with the 4th century. The settlements dated to the second half of the 1st millennium were concentrated in the northern part of Mures River, among them the one from [[Vladimirescu, Arad|Vladimirescu-Schanzen]], dated in the 8th and 9th centuries, according to the examinations from archaeological discoveries.\n\nIn the 10th century the Hungarians began [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|their expansion in Transylvania]], one of the main access routes being the valley of Mure\u015f. Ruler [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], under the threat of the Hungarian land-taking, built a fortress at [[Vladimirescu, Arad|Vladimirescu-Schanzen]] which was conquered and destroyed by the Hungarians in the middle of the tenth century. Another ruler, [[Ajtony|Achtum]], rebuilt it but the fortress was once again destroyed in 1028 by another Hungarian attack.  \n\nArad was first mentioned in documents in the 11th century. The [[Mongol]] invasion of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1241 showed the importance of the fortifications on this place, to which were added in the second half of the 13th century more stone fortresses at \u0218oimo\u0219, \u0218iria, and Dezna. The [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered the region from Hungary in 1551 and kept it until the [[Peace of Karlowitz]] of 1699. Arad became an [[eyalet]] center, which comprised the [[sanjaks]] of Arad, [[Lugoj]], Kaca\u0219, [[Zrenjanin|Be\u015flek]] and [[Ineu|Yanova]] from 1660 till 1697, when it was captured by Austrians ([[Serbian Militia]] under command of [[Subota Jovi\u0107]]) during Ottoman-Habsburg wars (1683\u20131699). After 1699, the city was ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, Arad became the center of the Eastern Orthodox [[Eparchy of Arad]]. According to 1720 data, the population of the city was composed of 177 Romanian families, 162 Serbian, and 35 Hungarian.<ref>Dr Du\u0161an J.

It became an ammunition depot. Thirteen rebel generals were executed there on 6 October 1849, by order of the Austrian general [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]]. These men are known collectively as [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], and since then Arad is considered the \"Hungarian [[Calvary|Golgotha]]\".

In the 3rd millennium BC prosperous settlements appear on both banks and on the islands of the Mure\u015f River belonging to an [[Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] civilisation, which peaked around 1000 BC.

In the 5th century a group of [[Scythians]] settled in the region but were assimilated by the [[Dacians]]. And between the 4th and 3rd centuries, the [[Celts]] settled on both banks of the Mure\u015f River, in the vicinity of the existing settlements. The coexistence of the Celts lasted about two centuries and ended with their assimilation by the numerous Dacians.\n\nThe Dacian settlement in the south of the [[Mic\u0103laca]] district was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] troops between 101 and 102. During the [[Second Dacian War]] (105-106), the Emperor [[Trajan]] conquered territories north of Mure\u015f River, making them part of the [[Roman Dacia]]. In the Aradul Nou area, the Roman army built the fort [[Castra of Aradul Nou]] that housed the legion [[Legio IV Flavia Felix]]. During the period between the 2nd and 4th centuries Dacian and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] settlements were present in the area of today's city, with intense commercial relations with the [[Roman Empire]]. \n\nThe first evidence of [[Slavs|Slavic]] assimilation by [[Proto-Romanians]] appeared with the 4th century. The settlements dated to the second half of the 1st millennium were concentrated in the northern part of Mures River, among them the one from [[Vladimirescu, Arad|Vladimirescu-Schanzen]], dated in the 8th and 9th centuries, according to the examinations from archaeological discoveries.\n\nIn the 10th century the Hungarians began [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|their expansion in Transylvania]], one of the main access routes being the valley of Mure\u015f. Ruler [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], under the threat of the Hungarian land-taking, built a fortress at [[Vladimirescu, Arad|Vladimirescu-Schanzen]] which was conquered and destroyed by the Hungarians in the middle of the tenth century. Another ruler, [[Ajtony|Achtum]], rebuilt it but the fortress was once again destroyed in 1028 by another Hungarian attack.  \n\nArad was first mentioned in documents in the 11th century. The [[Mongol]] invasion of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1241 showed the importance of the fortifications on this place, to which were added in the second half of the 13th century more stone fortresses at \u0218oimo\u0219, \u0218iria, and Dezna. The [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered the region from Hungary in 1551 and kept it until the [[Peace of Karlowitz]] of 1699. Arad became an [[eyalet]] center, which comprised the [[sanjaks]] of Arad, [[Lugoj]], Kaca\u0219, [[Zrenjanin|Be\u015flek]] and [[Ineu|Yanova]] from 1660 till 1697, when it was captured by Austrians ([[Serbian Militia]] under command of [[Subota Jovi\u0107]]) during Ottoman-Habsburg wars (1683\u20131699). After 1699, the city was ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, Arad became the center of the Eastern Orthodox [[Eparchy of Arad]]. According to 1720 data, the population of the city was composed of 177 Romanian families, 162 Serbian, and 35 Hungarian.<ref>Dr Du\u0161an J.

It became an ammunition depot. Thirteen rebel generals were executed there on 6 October 1849, by order of the Austrian general [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]]. These men are known collectively as [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], and since then Arad is considered the \"Hungarian [[Calvary|Golgotha]]\".  One of the public squares contains a martyrs' monument, erected in their memory. It consists of a colossal figure of Hungary, with four allegorical groups, and medallions of the executed generals.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nArad enjoyed great economic development in the 19th century.

At 70/4 Misbah came in and blitzed the South African bowling attack with a 197 run stand with the [[Asad Shafiq]] repeating the same stand the two had in the first test, Misbah scored 88 before trying to obliterate the part-time spinner [[Dean Elgar]] over cow corner but edged it straight to [[Jacques Kallis]].

After the defeat in Twenty20 series against [[England cricket team|England]] in 2012 and criticism from former cricketers, Misbah stepped down as Pakistan's Twenty20 captain and [[Mohammad Hafeez]] was named his successor to lead the team in Twenty20.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/564291.html \"Misbah steps down as Twenty20 captain.\"] ESPNcricinfo. 10 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Pakistan played bilateral series against South Africa, India, West Indies, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka and they also participated in Champions Trophy. Despite winning against India in India, away series lose against South Africa 3\u20132, win-less streak in Champions Trophy and winning against minnow Zimbabwe 2\u20131 and then again defeat in home series against South Africa in UAE 4\u20131 put huge criticism on Misbah's captaincy and his approach to the game. Especially series defeat against South Africa 4\u20131, brought Misbah's captaincy under severe scrutiny. Ex-Pakistani players were demanding a total renovation of Pakistan cricket, and Misbah was being criticized for his captaincy, slow batting and the defeat. The PCB, however, announced that Misbah was to remain captain until the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]]. Several TV shows and notable personalities opposed this decision and demanded that Misbah should be sacked.\n\nIn August 2016, under Misbah's captaincy, Pakistan achieved the number 1 ranking in test cricket for the first time since 1988. Pakistan displaced India as number 1 after rain caused the final test match between India and West Indies to end in a draw. PCB chairman [[Shahryar Khan]] and ex-Pakistan coach [[Waqar Younis]] said that all credit should be given to Misbah for his leadership over the last six years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pakistan rise to No. 1 in Test rankings |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/1049137.html |website=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMisbah is the most successful test captain of Pakistan. Misbah has led Pakistan in 56 test matches, winning 26, losing 19 with 11 draws. Misbah was named test captain after spot-fixing scandal during England tour of 2010. In subsequent series against South Africa in the UAE he led Pakistan in tests. After resignation of Shahid Afridi as test captain and suspension of Salman Butt due to spot-fixing scandal, Misbah was preferred over Younus Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Kamran Akmal as captain.

Especially series defeat against South Africa 4\u20131, brought Misbah's captaincy under severe scrutiny. Ex-Pakistani players were demanding a total renovation of Pakistan cricket, and Misbah was being criticized for his captaincy, slow batting and the defeat. The PCB, however, announced that Misbah was to remain captain until the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]].

After resignation of Shahid Afridi as test captain and suspension of Salman Butt due to spot-fixing scandal, Misbah was preferred over Younus Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Kamran Akmal as captain.

Afghans who carry [[Sayed]] or [[Quraishi]] in their names usually claim Arab [[ancestry]].\n\n==First wave==\n{{Further|Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Siege of Herat (643 CE)|Battle of Oxus River}}\n[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]]]]\n[[File:Afghanistan 14.jpg|thumb|The [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]] in [[Kabul]]]]\nAt the end of the 7th century, the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Arabs]] entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the [[Sassanid Empire]] in [[Battle of Nah\u0101vand|Nihawand]]. Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, [[Yazdegerd III]], who became a hunted fugitive, fled eastward deep into [[Central Asia]]. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the route the Arabs selected to enter the area was from north-eastern [[Iran]] and thereafter into [[Herat]] where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward eastern [[Name of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"Owens\"/> Some Arabs settled in these new areas and married locals while adopting new customs. Other groups and contingents who elected not to settle gradually pushed eastwards but encountered resistance in areas surrounding [[Bamiyan Province|Bamiyan]].<ref>Culture and Customs of Afghanistan By Hafizullah Emadi, pg.27</ref> When ultimately arriving at [[Kabul]], the Arabs confronted the [[Shahi|Kabul Shahan]] who had built a long defensive wall around the city. The bloodiest war in Kabul was in Chahardihi area where still tombs of Arabs killed in that war exist in DarulAman area. The most famous Arab character killed in that war was Shah-do Shamshira, whose tomb is located near Kabul river in Asmayee st. One of the most famous Commanders who fought against Arab invaders is known as ''Mazangi''. Mazangi was in command at the battle of ''Asmayee'' (Kohi-Sherdarwaza) where Shah-Do Shamshira was killed. There is a number sights where Arab invaders fought in Kabul, but the bloodiest battle after Asmayee was the battle of Alwoden in the area known as [[Darul Aman Palace|Darul Aman]] today. The historical details of this battle remains largely unknown, though the Arabs were nonetheless subdued in the long term. {{quote|''In the year [[Islamic calendar|44]] (664 AD), the Caliph Moavia Bin Aby Soofian nominated Zeead, the son of Oomya, to the government of Bussora, [[Sistan|Seestan]], and Khorassan. In the same year also [[Abdur Rahman|Abdool Ruhman Bin Shimur]], another Arab Ameer of distinction, marched from [[Merv|Murv]] to Kabul, where he made converts of upwards of twelve thousand persons... Saad was recalled in the year 59, and Abdool Ruhman, the son of Zeead, who formerly invaded Kabul, was nominated ruler of Khorassan... Shortly after his arrival in Khorassan, Sulim deputed his brother, Yezeed Bin Zeead, to Seestan. Not long after, Yezeed, having learned that the Prince of Kabul, throwing off his allegiance, had attacked and taken prisoner Aby Oobeyda, the son of Zeead, the late governor of Seestan, he marched with a force to recover that province, but was defeated in a pitched battle. When Sulim heard this news, he sent Tilla Bin Abdoolla, an officer of his court, as envoy to the court of Kabul, to ransom Aby Oobeyda; to obtain which object he paid 500,000 dirhems.  Tilla afterwards received the government of Seestan as a reward for his services on this occasion, where, having collected a large force, he subdued Kabul in the short term and [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Abdoolla]] (said by some to be the son of [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Wuleed]], and by others the son of Aboo Jehl) was nominated to its government.''<ref name=\"Ferishta\"/>|[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]]|(1560\u20131620)}}\n\nDespite the lack of much written accounts, another famous archaeological legacy of this battle remains standing in Kabul, notably the tomb of the [[Shah]]-e Do [[Shamshir]]a (translated into, ''The leader with the Two Swords'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) next to the [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]]. The site, located near Kabul's market district, was built near the area where an [[Ghazi (warrior)|Arab commander]] died. {{quote|''Despite fighting heroically with a sword in each hand, one of the Muslim head commanders fell in battle. It is his memory that is honored by the mosque today. The two-story edifice was built in the 1920s on the order of [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]]'s mother on the site of one of Kabul's first mosques.''}}\n\nFollowing the Arab confrontation, the region was made part of Khorasan with its seat of power in Herat in the west. The Arabs later partially relinquished some of their territorial control though reasserted its authority approximately 50 years later in 750 when the [[Abbasid]] caliphs replaced the [[Ummayad]]s.<ref>Afghanistan In A Nutshell By Amanda Roraback, pg. 9</ref> By then, many Arabs increasingly blended with locals as the Arabic identity in the region began to undergo a significant change. Arab contingents settled throughout various parts of present-day Afghanistan including the [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Logar province|Logar]], [[Kabul]], [[Balkh]] and in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]. Over time they adopted local customs and languages, some became [[Persianization|Persianized]] while others became [[Pashtunization|Afghanized]] who followed [[Pashtunwali]]. {{Quote|''Khalid being subsequently superseded, became apprehensive of returning to [[Arabia]] by the route of [[Persia]], on account of the enemies he had in that country, and equally so of remaining in Kabul, under his successor. He retired, therefore, with his family, and a number of Arab retainers, into the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sooli-many mountains]], situated between [[Multan|Mooltan]] and [[Peshawar|Pishawur]], where he took up his residence, and gave his daughter in marriage to one of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] [[tribal chief|chiefs]], who had become a proselyte to [[Islam|Maho-medism]]. From this marriage many children were born, among whom were two sons famous in history. The one [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lody]], the other [[Sur (Pashtun)|Soor]]; who each, subsequently, became head of the tribes which to this day bear their name.''<ref name=\"Ferishta\"/>|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah|(1560\u20131620)}}\n\nIt was during the reign of the [[Yaqub Saffar|Ya'qub Saffari]] that Arabic began losing its influence in the region.

The bloodiest war in Kabul was in Chahardihi area where still tombs of Arabs killed in that war exist in DarulAman area. The most famous Arab character killed in that war was Shah-do Shamshira, whose tomb is located near Kabul river in Asmayee st. One of the most famous Commanders who fought against Arab invaders is known as ''Mazangi''. Mazangi was in command at the battle of ''Asmayee'' (Kohi-Sherdarwaza) where Shah-Do Shamshira was killed. There is a number sights where Arab invaders fought in Kabul, but the bloodiest battle after Asmayee was the battle of Alwoden in the area known as [[Darul Aman Palace|Darul Aman]] today. The historical details of this battle remains largely unknown, though the Arabs were nonetheless subdued in the long term. {{quote|''In the year [[Islamic calendar|44]] (664 AD), the Caliph Moavia Bin Aby Soofian nominated Zeead, the son of Oomya, to the government of Bussora, [[Sistan|Seestan]], and Khorassan. In the same year also [[Abdur Rahman|Abdool Ruhman Bin Shimur]], another Arab Ameer of distinction, marched from [[Merv|Murv]] to Kabul, where he made converts of upwards of twelve thousand persons... Saad was recalled in the year 59, and Abdool Ruhman, the son of Zeead, who formerly invaded Kabul, was nominated ruler of Khorassan... Shortly after his arrival in Khorassan, Sulim deputed his brother, Yezeed Bin Zeead, to Seestan. Not long after, Yezeed, having learned that the Prince of Kabul, throwing off his allegiance, had attacked and taken prisoner Aby Oobeyda, the son of Zeead, the late governor of Seestan, he marched with a force to recover that province, but was defeated in a pitched battle. When Sulim heard this news, he sent Tilla Bin Abdoolla, an officer of his court, as envoy to the court of Kabul, to ransom Aby Oobeyda; to obtain which object he paid 500,000 dirhems.  Tilla afterwards received the government of Seestan as a reward for his services on this occasion, where, having collected a large force, he subdued Kabul in the short term and [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Abdoolla]] (said by some to be the son of [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Wuleed]], and by others the son of Aboo Jehl) was nominated to its government.''<ref name=\"Ferishta\"/>|[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]]|(1560\u20131620)}}\n\nDespite the lack of much written accounts, another famous archaeological legacy of this battle remains standing in Kabul, notably the tomb of the [[Shah]]-e Do [[Shamshir]]a (translated into, ''The leader with the Two Swords'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) next to the [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]]. The site, located near Kabul's market district, was built near the area where an [[Ghazi (warrior)|Arab commander]] died. {{quote|''Despite fighting heroically with a sword in each hand, one of the Muslim head commanders fell in battle. It is his memory that is honored by the mosque today. The two-story edifice was built in the 1920s on the order of [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]]'s mother on the site of one of Kabul's first mosques.''}}\n\nFollowing the Arab confrontation, the region was made part of Khorasan with its seat of power in Herat in the west. The Arabs later partially relinquished some of their territorial control though reasserted its authority approximately 50 years later in 750 when the [[Abbasid]] caliphs replaced the [[Ummayad]]s.<ref>Afghanistan In A Nutshell By Amanda Roraback, pg. 9</ref> By then, many Arabs increasingly blended with locals as the Arabic identity in the region began to undergo a significant change. Arab contingents settled throughout various parts of present-day Afghanistan including the [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Logar province|Logar]], [[Kabul]], [[Balkh]] and in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]. Over time they adopted local customs and languages, some became [[Persianization|Persianized]] while others became [[Pashtunization|Afghanized]] who followed [[Pashtunwali]]. {{Quote|''Khalid being subsequently superseded, became apprehensive of returning to [[Arabia]] by the route of [[Persia]], on account of the enemies he had in that country, and equally so of remaining in Kabul, under his successor. He retired, therefore, with his family, and a number of Arab retainers, into the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sooli-many mountains]], situated between [[Multan|Mooltan]] and [[Peshawar|Pishawur]], where he took up his residence, and gave his daughter in marriage to one of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] [[tribal chief|chiefs]], who had become a proselyte to [[Islam|Maho-medism]].

This included involving armed forces.\n\nIt was opposed in the Senate only by Senators [[Wayne Morse]] (D-OR) and [[Ernest Gruening]] (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\". {{Harv|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} The Johnson administration subsequently relied upon the resolution to begin its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in [[South Vietnam]] and open warfare between [[North Vietnam]] and the [[United States]].\n\n==Towards the Incident ==\nThroughout 1963, the Kennedy administration have become concerned that the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem was losing the war to the Viet Cong. Such concerns were intensified after Diem was overthrown and killed on 2 November 1963. On 19 December 1963, the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] visited Saigon and reported to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that the situation was \"very disturbing\" as \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} McNamara further reported the Viet Cong were winning the war as they controlled \"larger percentages of the population, greater amounts of territory and have destroyed or occupied more strategic hamlets than expected\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} About the Revolutionary Command Council as the South Vietnamese military junta called itself, McNamara was scathing, saying \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\" as the junta was \"indecisive and drifting\" with the generals being \"so preoccupied with essentially political affairs\" that they had no time for the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} \n\nIn response to McNamara's report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the United States intervene in the war, with the Air Force's commander, General [[Curtis LeMay]], calling for a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, saying \"we are swatting flies when we should be going after the manure pile\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} Using less earthly language than LeMay, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] in a report to Johnson called South Vietnam \"pivotal\" to the United States's \"worldwide confrontation with Communism\" and predicated that to allow South Vietnam to fall to the Viet Cong would be such a blow to American \"durability, resolution and trustworthiness\" that all of Asia might very well be lost to Communism.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}  Taylor also argued that to see South Vietnam fall to the Viet Cong would so damage \"our image\" in Africa and Latin America that both of those regions might also be lost to Communism as well.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Given these stakes with Taylor claiming the entire Third World would be lost to Communism if South Vietnam went Communist, he argued for drastic measures, saying the United States should taking \"increasing bolder\" measures with the United States to start bombing North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}The journalist [[Stanley Karnow]] wrote Taylor had offered up an \"inflated\" version of the \"domino theory\" with the entire Third World potentially lost to Communism if South Vietnam became the first \"domino\" to fall.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} \n\nThough Johnson was planning as president to focus on domestic affairs such as civil rights for Afro-Americans together with social legislation to improve the lot of the poor, he was very afraid that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would cause him to be branded as \"soft on Communism\", the dreaded accusation that could end the career of any American politician at the time.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Rather than the ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason of the \"domino theory\", Johnson was more motivated by the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason of the fear that if South Vietnam was \"lost\", it would generate a right-wing backlash similar to the one generated by the \"[[loss of China]]\" in 1949, which allowed Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to achieve national prominence.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} The fear that a new McCarthy-type Republican politician would emerge and derail his domestic reforms was Johnson's primary reason for refusing to accept the possibility of South Vietnam being \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} Johnson's determination to not \"lose\" South Vietnam extended to rejecting a peace plan put forward by the French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] who favored having South Vietnam becoming neutral in the Cold War in order to provide with Americans with an honorable way to disengage from Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=337}} Through not keen on fighting a war in Vietnam, Johnson told Taylor and other the chiefs of staff at a Christmas Eve party in 1963: \"Just let me get elected, and then you can have your war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} The instability of South Vietnamese politics suggested it was impossible for the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to focus on the war. Johnson stated at a meeting in the Oval Office that he was fed up with \"this coup shit\", and shortly there afterwards another coup took place in Saigon as General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] overthrew General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] on 30 January 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=334-335}} \n\nThrough the United States had long denounced the government of North Vietnam for trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, accusing Hanoi of \"aggression\", the government of South Vietnam had with American support also been trying to overthrow the government of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Ever since the Geneva Accords had partitioned Vietnam in 1954, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training squads of South Vietnamese volunteers and infiltrating them into North Vietnam with the aim of starting an anti-Communist guerrilla war with a spectacular lack of success.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} For an example, of the 80 teams that were infiltrated into North Vietnam in 1963, all of were captured, causing one CIA agent to later say: \"I didn't mind butchering the enemy, but we were butchering our own allies\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} In January 1964, Johnson gave his approval for a plan to step up the pace and intensity of the covert war against North Vietnam, which was code-named [[Operation 34A]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Johnson had hopes that Operation 34A might at best lead to the overthrow of North Vietnam's Communist government and at worse might so weaken North Vietnam as to end the war in South Vietnam. As part of Operation 34A, starting on 1 February 1964, South Vietnamese commandos began to conduct maritime raids on coastal North Vietnam under American naval operational command.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363-364}}\n\nThe new Kh\u00e1nh government proved to just as ineffective as the previous Minh government had been in fighting the war. In February 1964, [[Lyman Kirkpatrick]], the CIA's Inspector General, visited South Vietnam and reported that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say that we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340}} The general consensus amongst American Vietnam experts by early 1964 was as one official wrote \"unless there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces\" that South Vietnam had only \"an even chance of withstanding the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340-341}} Through in public, the Johnson administration still ruled out American intervention, but in private, Johnson was inclined to listen to the advice of McNamara and Taylor who advised him that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam now as the feuding generals of the Revolutionary Command Council was simply too disunited, too corrupt and too incompetent to win the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341}}  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nIn February 1964, [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], the director of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] pointed out a major constitutional problem with the plans to commit American forces to Vietnam, noting under the American constitution only Congress had the power to declare war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=357-358}} Johnson had made it that he was opposed to Kh\u00e1nh's plans to have South Vietnam invade North Vietnam out of the fear of causing a war with China, and he had even less enthusiasm for the United States invading North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=343}} To have the U.S. declare war on North Vietnam would lead to immense domestic pressure to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how in 1950 the approach of U.S. forces upon the Yalu led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, and was fearful that invading North Vietnam would again led to Chinese intervention. Moreover, unlike in 1950, by 1964 China had nuclear weapons.  To resolve this problem, Rostow suggested to Johnson that Congress pass a resolution authorizing Johnson to use force in Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=358}} \n\nRostow was supported by [[William Bundy]], the assistant secretary for Asia, who advised Johnson in a memo on 1 March 1964 that the U.S Navy should blockade Haiphong and start bombing North Vietnam's railroads, factories, road and training camps.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=344}} Bundy stated that the plans for stepped-up U.S involvement would \"normally require\" a declaration of war from Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} Bundy advised against the \"blunt instrument\" of a declaration of war as at present Johnson still only had only \"selective goals\" in Vietnam, but stated that it would be \"unsatisfactory\" to have Congress not endorse the planned increased involvement in Vietnam for constitutional reasons.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}}\u00a0Bundy argued that the \"best answer\" to this problem was an event from Johnson's own career as a Senator when in January 1955 when he voted for the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]]  giving President Eisenhower the power to use military force \"as he deems necessary\" to protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} At the time, the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|Taiwan Strait Crisis]] was raging with the Chinese Communists bombarding several islands in the Taiwan strait still held by the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, and many believed the congressional resolution giving Eisenhower the legal power to go to war in defense of Taiwan had ended the crisis. \n\nUnlike the 1955 resolution, which Johnson had supported as Senate Majority Leader and used all of his influence to get the other Senators to vote for, the current Senate Majority Leader, [[Mike Mansfield]], was known to be skeptical about using American forces to support South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Mansfield, a devout Catholic who was only willing to support wars that met the Catholic definition of a \"just war\" had once been one of South Vietnam's warmest supporters on Capital Hill, but after visiting South Vietnam in late 1962 came back very disillusioned by what he had seen, stating the regime was just as tyrannical as the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting to overthrow it.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=217-219 & 268}} Besides for Mansfield, Bundy predicated problems from Senator [[Wayne Morse]], a stubborn and cantankerous character who was known for his strongly held view that only Congress had power to declare war, and who deeply disliked resolutions like the Formosa resolution as weakening the power of Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Bundy warned the president that his \"doubtful friends\" in Congress might delay the passage of the desired resolution which would give America's European allies opposed to a war in Southeast Asia the chance to impose \"tremendous pressure\" on the U.S. to \"to stop and negotiate\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} \n\nMcNamara visited South Vietnam for four days starting on 8 March 1964, and upon his return to Washington was even more pessimistic than he been before in December 1963.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341-342}} McNamara reported to Johnson the situation had \"unquestionably been growing worse\" since his last visit in December as 40% of the countryside was now under Vietcong \"control or predominant influence\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} McNamara further reported that desertion rate in the ARVN was \"high and increasing\"; the Vietcong were \"recruiting energetically\"; the South Vietnamese people were overcome by \"apathy and indifference\"; and the \"greatest weakness\" was the \"uncertain viability\" of Kh\u00e1nh regime which might be overthrown by another coup at any moment.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} In response to McNamara's report, the National Security Council issued an \"action memorandum\" calling for increased military aid to South Vietnam and asserted that Vietnam was a \"test case\" of American global leadership, claiming that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would so damage American prestige that none of America's allies would believe in American promises if South Vietnam was \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} By presenting the Vietnam war in these stark terms with the melodramatic claim that the United States would cease to be a world power if South Vietnam was \"lost\", the \"action memorandum\" virtually guaranteed American intervention..{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAt the time, Morse was one of the few critics of Johnson's Vietnam policy. In a speech in April 1964, Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\", claiming: \"Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As Morse remained outspoken in his criticism of Johnson's Vietnam policy, accusing him of violating international law. on 13 May 1964, Bundy called a meeting to discuss how best to deal with Morse.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} [[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]], an aide to Bundy advised him that Morse was correct that the administration was \"on pretty thin ice\" when it came to advocating escalation on the basis of international law.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As it was felt that Morse was strong on the legalistic arguments, Moore recommended that the administration \"shift gears rapidly into a general (practical and political) rationale\" and ignore Morse as much as possible.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} Bundy believed the resolution as he was writing it would give Johnson \"the full support of the school of thought headed by Senator Mansfield and Senator Aiken and leave ourselves with die-hard opposition only from Senator Morse and his very few cohorts.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} \n\nBy late May 1964, a rough draft of the resolution that was to become the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had been completed by Bundy which if passed by Congress would give Johnson the legal power to use force to defend any nation in Southeast Asia threatened by \"Communist aggression or subversion\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}}  By the beginning of June 1964, the final draft of the resolution had been completed and all that remained to do was to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The acting Attorney General, [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], called resolution the \"functional equivalent of a declaration of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The U.S Air Force had already selected 94 sites in North Vietnam to be bombed while the U.S. Navy had moved a carrier task force into the Gulf of Tonkin with the orders to be prepared for \"reprisal bombings\" of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} Initially, the plans called for the United States to respond to guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam with bombing raids over North Vietnam, and then Johnson would submit the resolution to Congress sometime in late June 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361-362}} At the time, Congress was preoccupied with the Civil Rights Act, which was intended to outlaw segregation, a bill that Johnson had supported and was met with fierce resistance from Southern senators and congressmen who did everything within their power to \"kill the bill\". Johnson wanted the Civil Rights Act passed before submitting the resolution to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} On 15 June 1964, however Johnson's National Security Adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]], told the National Security Council that the president did not feel that Viet Cong attacks on the South Vietnamese government were a sufficient ''casus belli'' as Johnson wanted a North Vietnamese attack on American forces as his ''casus belli'', arguing that Congress would be more likely to pass the resolution if was in response to the latter rather than the former.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}}\u00a0On 18 June 1964, the Canadian diplomat [[J. Blair Seaborn]] arrived in Hanoi carrying the message from Johnson that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing if it continued on its present course. {{sfn|Hunt|1993|p=15}} In June 1964, the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, resigned in order to seek the Republican nomination for president. Johnson appointed Taylor as the new ambassador with orders to make the South Vietnamese fight.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=345}} Taylor's successor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General [[Earle Wheeler|Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler]]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==The Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin incident}}\nSoviet-North Vietnamese relations had badly strained in the early 1960s as North Vietnam moved closer to China, the more militant and aggressive of the two warring Communist giants.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} When [[Mao Zedong]] denounced [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for his \"cowardice\" for choosing a diplomatic compromise to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 instead of a nuclear war against the United States as Mao preferred, North Vietnamese newspapers approvingly cited his remarks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} Likewise, when Khrushchev signed the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, Mao again mocked him for his moderation, and was again approvingly quoted by North Vietnamese newspapers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} In a bid to recapture influence lost to China, the Soviet Union sold North Vietnam a radar system that was far more advanced than anything China could produce together with batteries of SAMs (surface-to-air missiles).{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} All through the spring and summer of 1964, Soviet workers were building and installing radar stations together with SAM batteries all over North Vietnam while training the North Vietnamese in their use.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As the U.S. Air Force and Navy were developing their plans at the same time to bomb North Vietnam, both the admirals and Air Force generals insisted that they needed more information about the radar network the Soviets were installing, most notably the frequencies the radar used in order to develop jamming mechanisms.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As a result, the U.S. Navy began to increase [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO patrols]] off the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The Navy's tactic was to have South Vietnamese commandos land to attack the North Vietnamese radar stations, forcing the operators to turn on the radars, which thereby allowed the Americans to learn what frequencies they used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The South Vietnamese commandos were landed in light, Norwegian-built patrol boats made of aluminium and armed with machine guns and cannons known as the Swift boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} \n\nBy July 1964, the rugged coastline of North Vietnam with its islands, bays, and estuaries was a war zone with South Vietnamese commandos constantly landing to raid while the North Vietnamese made vigorous efforts to stop the raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365-366}} In support of the raids, an American destroyer, the USS ''Maddox'' was deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin with orders to collect electronic intelligence on the North Vietnamese radar system.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Admiral [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.]], the commander of the Pacific fleet ordered Captain [[John J. Herrick]] of the ''Maddox'' not to go any closer that 8 miles from the coast of North Vietnam and no more than 4 miles from any of the archipelagos off the coast.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} The French had claimed control of only 3 miles of the waters off the coastline of Indochina, a claim that North Vietnam had inherited.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Subsequently, the North Vietnamese had extended their claim to control of waters 12 miles off their coastline, a claim the United States had declined to recognize.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} On 30 July 1964, South Vietnamese commandos tried to attack the North Vietnamese radar station on the island of Hon Me, but were detected as they were coming in, leading the North Vietnamese to open fire, making any landing impossible.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} The radar on Hon Me was turned on, and the ''Maddox'' stationed off the coast picked up the radar frequency being used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} North Vietnam made a formal protest about the raid to the International Control Commission consisting of delegations of diplomats from India, Canada and Poland that were supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords, accusing the United States of being behind the raid.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}}\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n[[File:President Lyndon B.

Breaking contact, the combatants commenced going their separate ways, when the three torpedo boats, '''T-333''', '''T-336''', and '''T-339''' were then attacked by four USN [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F-8 Crusader]] jet fighter bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=82}} The Crusaders reported no hits with their [[Zuni (rocket)|Zuni]] rockets, but scored hits on all three torpedo boats with their [[Colt Mk 12 cannon|20-mm cannons]], damaging all three boats. \n\nJohnson was informed of the incident and in the first use of the \"hotline\" to Moscow installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis called Khrushchev in the Kremlin to say that the United States did not want war, but he hoped that the Soviets would use their influence to persuade North Vietnam to not attack American warships.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=368-369}} Through Johnson had now an \"incident\" at sea involving a North Vietnamese attack against American warships, he declined to use it as a reason to present a resolution to Congress. Johnson's fear was that the North Vietnamese could claim that the attempted raid on the radar station on Hon Me on 30 July gave them legitimate fears that the ''Maddox'' might have been moving in for a new attack.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Johnson wanted an \"incident\" where it was unambiguous that the North Vietnamese were the aggressors by attacking American warships in waters that the American regarded as international. \n\nOut of the hope of provoking such an incident, Johnson ordered the ''Maddox'' to continue to cruise off the coast of North Vietnam, to be joined by another destroyer, USS ''Turner Joy'' with orders \"to attack any force that attacks them\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Both destroyers were ordered to sail 8 miles from North Vietnam in waters that Americans asserted were international waters, disregarding North Vietnam's claim to the 12-mile limit.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} The Secretary of State, [[Dean Rusk]], ordered his staff to \"pull together\" the resolution Bundy had written in May-June, just in case Johnson decided to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} On 3 August 1963, the South Vietnamese in their Swift boats raided Cape Vinhson and Cua Ron.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} The cruise of the American destroyers was not directly connected to the raid, but Herrick knew from reading the summaries of decrypted North Vietnamese radio messages that the North Vietnamese believed that it was.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} Herrick received orders to \"show the gauntlet\" and prove to the North Vietnamese that the Americans would sail off North Vietnam in waters that the Americans insisted were international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}}\u00a0\n\nTwo days later on a very stormy night on August 4, ''Maddox'' and the destroyer [[USS Turner Joy (DD-951)|''Turner Joy'']] both reported to be under attack again, by North Vietnamese torpedo boats; during this alleged engagement, ''Turner Joy'' fired approximately 220 3-inch & 5-inch shells at radar controlled surface targets.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} In response to the reported attack, aircraft from the ''Ticonderoga''  were launched, but the pilots reported no visual contact with any craft other than the two destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} [[Hanoi]] subsequently insisted that it had not launched a second attack. Through Herrick had reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, he soon developed strong doubts about whatever an attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick reported to Admiral Sharp that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly radar blips due to the \"freak weather effects\" caused by the storm and that an \"overeager\" sonar operator abroad the ''Maddox'' had mistaken the effects of the storm for torpedoes.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick's report concluded with the statement the \"entire action leaves many doubts\" as he noted that no sailor abroad his ship had seen a torpedo boat nor had heard any gunfire beyond the guns of the ''Turner Joy''.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Likewise no sailor abroad the ''Turner Joy'' claimed to have seen any North Vietnamese craft and none of the pilots of the Crusader aircraft stated that they had seen any torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\n\nA later investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] ([[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]]) mission. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing the ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that ''Maddox'' had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the engagement of August 4. The report stated:\n\n{{quote|It is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. ...

Johnson in his television address announced: \"Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson requested approval of a resolution \"expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia\", stating that the resolution should express support \"for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces\", but repeated previous assurances that \"the United States ... seeks no wider war\". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help \"hostile nations ... understand\" that the United States was unified in its determination \"to continue to protect its national interests\".{{sfn|President's Message to Congress|1964}} \n\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had broken North Vietnam's codes, and McNamara put much emphasis to Johnson on certain decrypts speaking of North Vietnamese torpedo boats having been damaged by American destroyers as proving the second incident happened.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373}} However, several intelligence analysis at the time accused McNamara of having either have misinterpreted, either intentionally or by mistake, decrypts referring to the first incident of 2 August and presenting them as referring to the second alleged incident of 4 August.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373-374}} [[Ray S. Cline]], the deputy director of the CIA later stated: \"I felt from the start that the second incident had been questionable, but I simply wasn't sure. However, after a number of days collating and examining the reports relating to the second incident, I concluded that they were either unsound or that they dealt with the first incident\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Cline was told to keep his doubts to himself.\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Johnson submitted the resolution to Congress, which if passed would give him the legal power to \"take all necessary measures\" and \"prevent further aggression\" as well as allowing him to decide when \"peace and security\" in Southeast Asia were attained.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Johnson commented the resolution was \"like grandma's nightshirt-it covered everything\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Despite his public claims of \"aggression\", Johnson in private believed that the second incident had not taken place, saying at a meeting in the Oval Office in his Texas twang: \"Hell, those dumb stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} The president's two chosen instruments for passing the resolution were the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara had the image of the \"whiz kid\", a man of almost superhuman intelligence and ability whose computer-generated graphs and spreadsheets showed the best way to \"scientifically\" solve any problem.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara, whose statements always seemed to be backed up by the Pentagon's computers had the ability to \"dazzle\" Congress and whatever he requested of Congress tended to be approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Fulbright, through too much an individualist and an intellectual to fit into the Senate's \"Club\", was widely respected as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert and as a defender of Congress's prerogatives.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} If Fulbright backed the resolution, Johnson knew that he would probably carry over the doubters and waverers, of which there were several.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Johnson knew that the conservative Republicans together with the conservative Southern Democrats would vote for the resolution, but he did not want to be dependent upon their support for his foreign policy as his domestic policies were anathema to them.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}\u00a0From Johnson's viewpoint, having liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans vote for the resolution would free his hands to carry out the domestic reforms he wanted to have Congress pass after the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \u00a0\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where the president asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the destroyers had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \"soft on Communism\" and by contrast promised a \"total victory\" over Communism.\u00a0Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright had much contempt for whoever happened to be Secretary of State, always believing that he understood foreign policy better than any of them, and had a particular contempt for Rusk, so the offer to be Secretary of State was tempting for him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} Fulbright also felt a strong rapport with his fellow Southerner Johnson, the first Southern president since Wilson.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} \u00a0Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson told Fulbright he wanted the resolution passed by the widest possible margin to show North Vietnam that Congress was united behind the administration.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Despite all of Johnson's efforts, there was little danger of the resolution not being passed. A public opinion poll at the time showed that 85% of Americans felt that Congress should pass the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn August 6, [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara|Robert S. McNamara]] testified before a joint session of the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] committees. He stated that ''Maddox'' had been \"carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times\" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In his testimony, McNamara accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and of an \"unprovoked attack\" on the destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had been tipped off by a source inside the Pentagon about Operation 34A, and asked McNamara about there was any connection between the activities of the ''Maddox'' and Operation 34A, leading to a blunt denial.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} In response to Morse's question, McNamara answered dismissively: \"Our navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions, if there were any...I say this flatly. This is a fact\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of ''Maddox'', had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called [[Operation 34A|Operation Plan 34A]]. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese [[commando]]s under the control of a [[United States Special Operations Forces|special operations unit]] of the U.S. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] called the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group|Studies and Operations Group]].{{sfn|Andrad\u00e9|Conboy|1999}}\n\nDespite McNamara's statement, Morse appeared before an almost empty Senate later on 6 August 1964 to say: \"The place to settle the controversy is not on the battlefield but around the conference table\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Morse was supported only by Senator [[Ernest Gruening]] who stated in a speech \"all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]], who previously had doubts about Vietnam and whose friendship with Johnson had just been destroyed by the latter's support for the Civil Rights Act, supported the resolution, saying: \"Our national honor is at stake. We cannot and will not shrink from defending it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's thesis, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright called the resolution a mechanism \"calculated to prevent the spread of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \n\nAt a crucial meeting of several Senators, Fulbright was able to persuade them to support the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Several Senators such as [[Allen J. Ellender]], [[Jacob Javits]], [[John Sherman Cooper]], [[Daniel Brewster]], [[George McGovern]] and [[Gaylord Nelson]] were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and at the meeting Fulbright called to discuss the issue, he argued that passing a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Nelson wanted to add an amendment forbidding Johnson from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless Congress gave its approval first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} Fulbright dissuaded him, saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Fulbright argued to Nelson the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} From the viewpoint of Nelson, a liberal Democrat known for his support of environmentalism, Johnson was a far more preferable president than Goldwater, the leader of the right-wing of the Republican Party. \n\nAfter fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] authorizing the president \"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]] requesting assistance in defense of its freedom\". {{Harv|H.J. RES 1145|1964}} The unanimous affirmative vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 416\u20130. (However, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Eugene Siler]] of [[Kentucky]], who was not present but opposed the measure, was [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|\"paired\"]] with another member who favored the resolution\u2014i.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The [[United States Senate|Senate]] conferred its approval by a vote of 88\u20132. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]] and [[Ernest Gruening]] of [[Alaska]] cast the only nay votes.{{sfn|Kenworthy|1964}} At the time, Senator Morse warned that \"I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.\"{{sfn|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} Morse also predicated that those who voted for the resolution \"will love to regret it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Much to Johnson's satisfaction, Senator Goldwater voted for the resolution as appropriate, which allowed the president to present himself as just \"tough on Communism\" as his opponent.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}}\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nAfter the resolution was passed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[John W. McCormack]] called Johnson to congratulate him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} The call was recorded and Johnson spent much time denouncing Morse as mentally unstable and untrustworthy while he called Gruening an ingrate, saying \"He's just no good. I've spent millions on him up in Alaska\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} Rostow was ebullient and stated: \"The second attack probably hadn't happened, but it was the chance to do what we should have been doing all along\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}}\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n==As a policy instrument==\nThe passage of the resolution alarmed several American allies who preferred that the United States not fight in Vietnam such as Canada. [[J. Blair Seaborn]], the Canadian diplomat who served as Canada's representative to the [[International Control Commission]] engaged in secret \"shuttle diplomacy\" carrying messages back and forth from Hanoi to Washington in an attempt to stop the escalation of the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} On 13 August 1964, Seaborn arrived in Hanoi to meet the North Vietnamese Premier, [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn told \u0110\u1ed3ng that based on his recent meetings with Johnson that he was seriously using the powers he just gained from the Gulf of Tonkin resolution to go to war, but also stated that Johnson was willing to offer \"economic and other benefits\" if only North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn further stated that Johnson had told him that North Vietnam would \"suffer the consequences\" if it continued on its \"present course\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}} \u0110\u1ed3ng rejected the offer, saying he would rather see the war engulf \"the whole of Southeast Asia\" than to abandon the vision of one Communist Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}}\n\nThrough Johnson now had the power to wage war in Vietnam, he proved reluctant  to use it, instead hoping that Ambassador Taylor could somehow pressure the South Vietnamese to fight better.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377-378}}  On 11 August 1964, William Bundy wrote a memo on the \"next course of action\", under which predicated that unless South Vietnamese \"morale and momentum\" could be improved, the regime of General Khanh would collapse.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy recommended a programme of gradually increasing escalation to achieve \"maximum results for minimal risks\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy argued for August, the United States should do nothing to \"take onus off the Communist side for escalation\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Starting in September, the memo advocated more DESOTO patrols, 34A raids, and for the United States to start bombing the part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} In January 1965, Bundy stated the \"next move upward\" would begin with a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor objected to Bundy's plan, stating if the U.S started bombing North Vietnam, it would trigger a North Vietnamese response that the South Vietnamese would not be able to handle on their own.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor, who had become increasingly disillusioned with South Vietnam as Khanh drove him to exasperation with his stupidity wrote: \"We should not get involved militarily with North Vietnam and possibly with Red China if our base in South Vietnam is insecure and Khanh's army is tied down everywhere by the Vietcong insurgency\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} General Wheeler and the rest of Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected Taylor's advice and advocated an immediate strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397-398}} On 7 September 1964, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by McNamara, Rusk, Wheeler, the Bundy brothers and Taylor to discuss what to do.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=398}} Taylor conceded that there \"only the emergence of an exceptional leader could improve the situation and there is no George Washington in sight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} The meeting concluded that the U.S. would react \"as appropriate\" against \"any\" attacks against American forces.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} A war game conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1963 code-named Sigma I found that the U.S. would have to commit half-million troops to have a chance of victory in Vietnam; its sequel code-named Sigma II in September 1964 reached the same conclusion and found that despite the claims of General LeMay that a strategical bombing campaign would not be decisive, instead stating that the war would only be won on the ground.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} \u00a0\n\nOn 1 November 1964, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked the American air field at the [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], killing 5 American servicemen and destroying 6 B-57 bombers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402}} Wheeler recommended an immediate bombing campaign against North Vietnam, but Johnson demurred, instead creating a \"working group\" to consider scenarios for American intervention.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402-403}} The conclusion of the \"working group\" chaired by William Bundy when presented in late November resorted to the bureaucratic device of the \"Goldilocks's Principle\" by presenting Johnson with two extreme options of either invading North Vietnam or abandoning South Vietnam; in between the two extremes was the third option of gradual escalation, which Bundy knew that Johnson would chose.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=404}} On 1 December 1964, McNamara, Rusk and \"Mac\" Bundy presented Johnson again with the \"Goldilock's Principle\" by giving him three options, knowing he would chose the third as invading North Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam were too extreme for him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} Johnson agreed to their advice to launch [[Operation Barrel Roll]] to bomb the Lao section of the Ho Chi Minh trail and for more 34A raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} On Christmas Eve 1964, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=408}} Despite almost unanimous advice to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson refused, saying in a cable to Taylor \"The final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}} Johnson added: \"I have never felt that this war will be won from the air, and it seems to me that what is much needed and would be more effective is a larger and stronger use of Rangers and Special Forces and Marines, or other appropriate military strength on the ground and on scene..I know that it might involve the acceptance of larger Americans sacrifices but I myself am ready to substantially increase the Americans in Vietnam if it is necessary to provide this kind of fighting force against the Vietcong\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}}\n\nAs Johnson continued to procrastinate, he repeatedly received advice from McNamara, the Bundy brothers, Rusk, Wheeler and Taylor that now was the time to use his powers under the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409-411}} A memo co-written by \"Mac\" Bundy and McNamara in January 1965 stated \"our present policy can lead only to a disastrous defeat\" with the alternative being either \"salvage what little can be saved\" by withdrawing or to commit American forces to war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=411}} By contrast, Taylor advised Johnson against committing American troops, stating that having the Americans \"carry the ball\" would only encourage South Vietnam's feuding generals to engage in even more in-fighting at the expense of the war effort, thus creating a vicious circle where the Americans would do all the fighting while the ARVN did nothing, leading to a situation where more and more Americans would be needed.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=410}} After a Viet Cong attack on the American air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by his national security team plus Mansfield and McCormack to announce that \"I've had enough of this\" and that he had decided on a bombing campaign.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Only Mansfield and the Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] opposed the plans to bomb North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Johnson ordered [[Operation Flaming Dart]] on 7 February 1965, a bombing raid on a North Vietnamese Army base, which marked the beginning of a series of increasing intense bombing raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} The British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], who was strongly opposed to the United States fighting a war in Asia which would distract American attention from Europe, wrote to Johnson proposing a summit in Washington, where he intended to press Johnson to not use his powers under the resolution to fight war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguthn|2000|p=342}} Johnson phoned Wilson to say the proposed summit was unnecessary, maintaining he could not see \"what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our coattails out\", and instead urged Wilson to send British troops to fight in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguthn|2000|p=342}} On 22 February 1965, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, General [[William Westmoreland]], stated that he had no confidence in the ability of the ARVN to protect the American air base at Danang and asked for two Marine battalions to protect it, a request that Johnson approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 2 March 1965, Johnson ordered [[Operation Rolling Thunder]], the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that had long been urged upon him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 8 March 1965, two battalions of Marines landed at Danang to fulfill Westmoreland's request for troops to protect the air base.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=412}} \n\nFulbright who developed doubts by this point advised Johnson that a \"massive ground and air war in Southeast Asia\" would be a \"disaster\", but Johnson now had the legal power to wage war as he saw fit and disregarded his warning not send any more troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=418}} The Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Wheeler now recommended further troops to Vietnam and on 1 April 1965 Johnson agreed to send 2 more Marine battalions plus 28, 000 logistic troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417}} At the same time, Johnson approved Westmoreland's request for \"offensive defense\" by allowing the Marines to patrol the countryside instead of just guarding the air base, committing the U.S. to a ground war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417-418}} Taylor wrote that Johnson having \"crossed the Rubicon\" with Rolling Thunder \"was now off to Rome on the double\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} On 20 April 1965, Johnson approved a plan to send 40, 000 U.S Army troops to South Vietnam by June.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} In June, Westmoreland reported \"The South Vietnamese armed forces cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial U.S. combat troops on the ground\" and stated that he needed 180, 000 men immediately, a request that was granted in July.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=422-426}} On 28 July 1965, Johnson gave a TV speech saying: \"I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me. And we will meet his needs. We cannot be defeated by force of arms. We will stand in Vietnam\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=426}}\n\nIn February 1966, Morse introduced a motion to repeal the resolution, which he argued was unconstitutional and had been used in ways that Johnson had promised that it would not be.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Through Morse's motion had no chance of passing with Senate Majority Leader Mansfield fatalistically saying \"we are in too deep now\", he was able to extend the debate for two weeks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Morse who was described as a \"skilled parliamentarian\" was able to use various procedural methods to keep the debate going despite Mansfield's efforts, and several senators spoke in favor of the motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Russell complained about the \"very great grant of power\" that the resolution had granted Johnson.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Ultimately, most senators followed Johnson's argument that America was at war and it was the patriotic duty of Congress to support the president, no matter what, and only five senators voted for Morse's motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Repeal ==\n{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}} By 1967, the rationale for what had become a costly U.S. involvement In the [[Vietnam War]] was receiving close scrutiny. With [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]] mounting, a movement to repeal the resolution\u2014which war critics decried as having given the Johnson administration a \"[[blank check]]\"\u2014began to gather steam.\n\nAn investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] collection [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident#The incident|mission off the North Vietnamese coast]].{{sfn|Finney|1968}} It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}}\n\nThe administration of President [[Richard Nixon]], which took office in January 1969, initially opposed repeal, warning of \"consequences for Southeast Asia [that] go beyond the war in Vietnam\". In 1970 the administration began to shift its stance. It asserted that its conduct of operations in Southeast Asia was based not on the resolution but was a constitutional exercise of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief of U.S. military forces, to take necessary steps to protect American troops as they were gradually withdrawn{{sfn|NYT|1970}} (the U.S. had begun withdrawing its forces from Vietnam in 1969 under a policy known as \"[[Vietnamization]]\").\n\nMounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the [[Foreign Military Sales Act of 1971|Foreign Military Sales Act]] that Nixon signed in January 1971.{{sfn|NYT|1971}} Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] in 1973, over [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Richard Nixon|Nixon's veto]].

Johnson]] authorization, without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by Congress, for the use of [[Conventional warfare|conventional]] military force in [[Southeast Asia]]. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \"any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]]\". This included involving armed forces.\n\nIt was opposed in the Senate only by Senators [[Wayne Morse]] (D-OR) and [[Ernest Gruening]] (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\". {{Harv|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} The Johnson administration subsequently relied upon the resolution to begin its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in [[South Vietnam]] and open warfare between [[North Vietnam]] and the [[United States]].\n\n==Towards the Incident ==\nThroughout 1963, the Kennedy administration have become concerned that the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem was losing the war to the Viet Cong. Such concerns were intensified after Diem was overthrown and killed on 2 November 1963. On 19 December 1963, the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] visited Saigon and reported to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that the situation was \"very disturbing\" as \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} McNamara further reported the Viet Cong were winning the war as they controlled \"larger percentages of the population, greater amounts of territory and have destroyed or occupied more strategic hamlets than expected\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} About the Revolutionary Command Council as the South Vietnamese military junta called itself, McNamara was scathing, saying \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\" as the junta was \"indecisive and drifting\" with the generals being \"so preoccupied with essentially political affairs\" that they had no time for the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} \n\nIn response to McNamara's report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the United States intervene in the war, with the Air Force's commander, General [[Curtis LeMay]], calling for a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, saying \"we are swatting flies when we should be going after the manure pile\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} Using less earthly language than LeMay, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] in a report to Johnson called South Vietnam \"pivotal\" to the United States's \"worldwide confrontation with Communism\" and predicated that to allow South Vietnam to fall to the Viet Cong would be such a blow to American \"durability, resolution and trustworthiness\" that all of Asia might very well be lost to Communism.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}  Taylor also argued that to see South Vietnam fall to the Viet Cong would so damage \"our image\" in Africa and Latin America that both of those regions might also be lost to Communism as well.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Given these stakes with Taylor claiming the entire Third World would be lost to Communism if South Vietnam went Communist, he argued for drastic measures, saying the United States should taking \"increasing bolder\" measures with the United States to start bombing North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}The journalist [[Stanley Karnow]] wrote Taylor had offered up an \"inflated\" version of the \"domino theory\" with the entire Third World potentially lost to Communism if South Vietnam became the first \"domino\" to fall.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} \n\nThough Johnson was planning as president to focus on domestic affairs such as civil rights for Afro-Americans together with social legislation to improve the lot of the poor, he was very afraid that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would cause him to be branded as \"soft on Communism\", the dreaded accusation that could end the career of any American politician at the time.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Rather than the ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason of the \"domino theory\", Johnson was more motivated by the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason of the fear that if South Vietnam was \"lost\", it would generate a right-wing backlash similar to the one generated by the \"[[loss of China]]\" in 1949, which allowed Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to achieve national prominence.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} The fear that a new McCarthy-type Republican politician would emerge and derail his domestic reforms was Johnson's primary reason for refusing to accept the possibility of South Vietnam being \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} Johnson's determination to not \"lose\" South Vietnam extended to rejecting a peace plan put forward by the French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] who favored having South Vietnam becoming neutral in the Cold War in order to provide with Americans with a honorable way to disengage from Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=337}} Through not keen on fighting a war in Vietnam, Johnson told Taylor and other the chiefs of staff at a Christmas Eve party in 1963: \"Just let me get elected, and then you can have your war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} The instability of South Vietnamese politics suggested it was impossible for the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e the South Vietnamese Army) to focus on the war. Johnson stated at a meeting in the Oval Office that he was fed up with \"this coup shit\", and shortly there afterwards another coup took place in Saigon as General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] overthrew General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] on 30 January 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=334-335}} \n\nThrough the United States had long denounced the government of North Vietnam for trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, accusing Hanoi of \"aggression\", the government of South Vietnam had with American support also been trying to overthrow the government of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Ever since the Geneva Accords had partitioned Vietnam in 1954, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training squads of South Vietnamese volunteers and infiltrating them into North Vietnam with the aim of starting an anti-Communist guerrilla war with a spectacular lack of success.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} For an example, of the 80 teams that were infiltrated into North Vietnam in 1963, all of were captured, causing one CIA agent to later say: \"I didn't mind butchering the enemy, but we were butchering our own allies\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} In January 1964, Johnson gave his approval for a plan to step up the pace and intensity of the covert war against North Vietnam, which was code-named [[Operation 34A]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Johnson had hopes that Operation 34A might at best lead to the overthrow of North Vietnam's Communist government and at worse might so weaken North Vietnam as to end the war in South Vietnam. As part of Operation 34A, starting on 1 February 1964, South Vietnamese commandos began to conduct maritime raids on coastal North Vietnam under American naval operational command.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363-364}}\n\nThe new Kh\u00e1nh government proved to just as ineffective as the previous Minh government had been in fighting the war. In February 1964, [[Lyman Kirkpatrick]], the CIA's Inspector General, visited South Vietnam and reported that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say that we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340}} The general consensus amongst American Vietnam experts by early 1964 was as one official wrote \"unless there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces\" that South Vietnam had only \"an even chance of withstanding the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340-341}} Through in public, the Johnson administration still ruled out American intervention, but in private, Johnson was inclined to listen to the advice of McNamara and Taylor who advised him that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam now as the feuding generals of the Revolutionary Command Council was simply too disunited, too corrupt and too incompetent to win the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341}}  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nIn February 1964, [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], the director of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] pointed out a major constitutional problem with the plans to commit American forces to Vietnam, noting under the American constitution only Congress had the power to declare war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=357-358}} Johnson had made it that he was opposed to Kh\u00e1nh's plans to have South Vietnam invade North Vietnam out of the fear of causing a war with China, and he had even less enthusiasm for the United States invading North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=343}} To have the U.S. declare war on North Vietnam would lead to immense domestic pressure to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how in 1950 the approach of U.S. forces upon the Yalu led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, and was fearful that invading North Vietnam would again led to Chinese intervention. Moreover, unlike in 1950, by 1964 China had nuclear weapons.  To resolve this problem, Rostow suggested to Johnson that Congress pass a resolution authorizing Johnson to use force in Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=358}} \n\nRostow was supported by [[William Bundy]], the assistant secretary for Asia, who advised Johnson in a memo on 1 March 1964 that the U.S Navy should blockade Haiphong and start bombing North Vietnam's railroads, factories, road and training camps.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=344}} Bundy stated that the plans for stepped-up U.S involvement would \"normally require\" a declaration of war from Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} Bundy advised against the \"blunt instrument\" of a declaration of war as at present Johnson still only had only \"selective goals\" in Vietnam, but stated that it would be \"unsatisfactory\" to have Congress not endorse the planned increased involvement in Vietnam for constitutional reasons.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}}\u00a0Bundy argued that the \"best answer\" to this problem was an event from Johnson's own career as a Senator when in January 1955 when he voted for the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]]  giving President Eisenhower the power to use military force \"as he deems necessary\" to protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} At the time, the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|Taiwan Strait Crisis]] was raging with the Chinese Communists bombarding several islands in the Taiwan strait still held by the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, and many believed the congressional resolution giving Eisenhower the legal power to go to war in defense of Taiwan had ended the crisis. \n\nUnlike the 1955 resolution, which Johnson had supported as Senate Majority Leader and used all of his influence to get the other Senators to vote for, the current Senate Majority Leader, [[Mike Mansfield]], was known to be skeptical about using American forces to support South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Mansfield, a devout Catholic who was only willing to support wars that met the Catholic definition of a \"just war\" had once been one of South Vietnam's warmest supporters on Capital Hill, but after visiting South Vietnam in late 1962 came back very disillusioned by what he had seen, stating the regime was just as tyrannical as the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting to overthrow it.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=217-219 & 268}} Besides for Mansfield, Bundy predicated problems from Senator [[Wayne Morse]], a stubborn and cantankerous character who was known for his strongly held view that only Congress had power to declare war, and who deeply disliked resolutions like the Formosa resolution as weakening the power of Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Bundy warned the president that his \"doubtful friends\" in Congress might delay the passage of the desired resolution which would give America's European allies opposed to a war in Southeast Asia the chance to impose \"tremendous pressure\" on the U.S. to \"to stop and negotiate\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} \n\nMcNamara visited South Vietnam for four days starting on 8 March 1964, and upon his return to Washington was even more pessimistic than he been before in December 1963.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341-342}} McNamara reported to Johnson the situation had \"unquestionably been growing worse\" since his last visit in December as 40% of the countryside was now under Vietcong \"control or predominant influence\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} McNamara further reported that desertion rate in the ARVN was \"high and increasing\"; the Vietcong were \"recruiting energetically\"; the South Vietnamese people were overcome by \"apathy and indifference\"; and the \"greatest weakness\" was the \"uncertain viability\" of Kh\u00e1nh regime which might be overthrown by another coup at any moment.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} In response to McNamara's report, the National Security Council issued an \"action memorandum\" calling for increased military aid to South Vietnam and asserted that Vietnam was a \"test case\" of American global leadership, claiming that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would so damage American prestige that none of America's allies would believe in American promises if South Vietnam was \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} By presenting the Vietnam war in these stark terms with the melodramatic claim that the United States would cease to be a world power if South Vietnam was \"lost\", the \"action memorandum\" virtually guaranteed American intervention..{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAt the time, Morse was one of the few critics of Johnson's Vietnam policy. In a speech in April 1964, Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\", claiming: \"Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As Morse remained outspoken in his criticism of Johnson's Vietnam policy, accusing him of violating international law. on 13 May 1964, Bundy called a meeting to discuss how best to deal with Morse.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} [[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]], an aide to Bundy advised him that Morse was correct that the administration was \"on pretty thin ice\" when it came to advocating escalation on the basis of international law.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As it was felt that Morse was strong on the legalistic arguments, Moore recommended that the administration \"shift gears rapidly into a general (practical and political) rationale\" and ignore Morse as much as possible.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} Bundy believed the resolution as he was writing it would give Johnson \"the full support of the school of thought headed by Senator Mansfield and Senator Aiken and leave ourselves with die-hard opposition only from Senator Morse and his very few cohorts.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} \n\nBy late May 1964, a rough draft of the resolution that was to become the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had been completed by Bundy which if passed by Congress would give Johnson the legal power to use force to defend any nation in Southeast Asia threatened by \"Communist aggression or subversion\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}}  By the beginning of June 1964, the final draft of the resolution had been completed and all that remained to do was to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The acting Attorney General, [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], called resolution the \"functional equivalent of a declaration of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The U.S Air Force had already selected 94 sites in North Vietnam to be bombed while the U.S. Navy had moved a carrier task force into the Gulf of Tonkin with the orders to be prepared for \"reprisal bombings\" of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} Initially, the plans called for the United States to respond to guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam with bombing raids over North Vietnam, and then Johnson would submit the resolution to Congress sometime in late June 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361-362}} At the time, Congress was preoccupied with the Civil Rights Act, which was intended to outlaw segregation, a bill that Johnson had supported and was met with fierce resistance from Southern senators and congressmen who did everything within their power to \"kill the bill\". Johnson wanted the Civil Rights Act passed before submitting the resolution to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} On 15 June 1964, however Johnson's National Security Adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]], told the National Security Council that the president did not feel that Viet Cong attacks on the South Vietnamese government were a sufficient ''casus belli'' as Johnson wanted a North Vietnamese attack on American forces as his ''casus belli'', arguing that Congress would be more likely to pass the resolution if was in response to the latter rather than the former.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}}\u00a0On 18 June 1964, the Canadian diplomat [[J. Blair Seaborn]] arrived in Hanoi carrying the message from Johnson that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing if it continued on its present course. {{sfn|Hunt|1993|p=15}} In June 1964, the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, resigned in order to seek the Republican nomination for president. Johnson appointed Taylor as the new ambassador with orders to make the South Vietnamese fight.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=345}} Taylor's successor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General [[Earle Wheeler|Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler]]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==The Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin incident}}\nSoviet-North Vietnamese relations had badly strained in the early 1960s as North Vietnam moved closer to China, the more militant and aggressive of the two warring Communist giants.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} When [[Mao Zedong]] denounced [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for his \"cowardice\" for choosing a diplomatic compromise to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 instead of a nuclear war against the United States as Mao preferred, North Vietnamese newspapers approvingly cited his remarks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} Likewise, when Khrushchev signed the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, Mao again mocked him for his moderation, and was again approvingly quoted by North Vietnamese newspapers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} In a bid to recapture influence lost to China, the Soviet Union sold North Vietnam a radar system that was far more advanced than anything China could produce together with batteries of SAMs (surface-to-air missiles).{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} All through the spring and summer of 1964, Soviet workers were building and installing radar stations together with SAM batteries all over North Vietnam while training the North Vietnamese in their use.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As the U.S. Air Force and Navy were developing their plans at the same time to bomb North Vietnam, both the admirals and Air Force generals insisted that they needed more information about the radar network the Soviets were installing, most notably the frequencies the radar used in order to develop jamming mechanisms.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As a result, the U.S. Navy began to increase [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO patrols]] off the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The Navy's tactic was to have South Vietnamese commandos land to attack the North Vietnamese radar stations, forcing the operators to turn on the radars, which thereby allowed the Americans to learn what frequencies they used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The South Vietnamese commandos were landed in light, Norwegian-built patrol boats made of aluminium and armed with machine guns and cannons known as the Swift boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} \n\nBy July 1964, the rugged coastline of North Vietnam with its islands, bays, and estuaries was a war zone with South Vietnamese commandos constantly landing to raid while the North Vietnamese made vigorous efforts to stop the raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365-366}} In support of the raids, an American destroyer, the USS ''Maddox'' was deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin with orders to collect electronic intelligence on the North Vietnamese radar system.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Admiral [[U.

Johnson signs \"Gulf of Tonkin\" resolution - NARA - 192484.tif|thumbnail|right|President Johnson as he signs the resolution on August 10, 1964]] [[File:Tonkin Gulf Resolution.jpg|thumb|275px]] The {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}}, a U.S. [[destroyer]], was conducting a [[DESOTO patrol]] in the waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] on August 2, 1964, when it reported being attacked by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats from the 135th Torpedo Squadron,{{sfn|Moise|1996|pp=50, 78}} which were attempting to close their range on ''Maddox'' for effective torpedo fire (1,000 yards was maximum effective range for the torpedoes){{sfn|Moise|1996|p=71}}{{sfn|Hanyok|2000}} ''Maddox'' fired over 280 5-inch shells{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=78}} and the boat expended their 6 torpedoes (all misses) and some 14.5-mm machinegun fire. Breaking contact, the combatants commenced going their separate ways, when the three torpedo boats, '''T-333''', '''T-336''', and '''T-339''' were then attacked by four USN [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F-8 Crusader]] jet fighter bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=82}} The Crusaders reported no hits with their [[Zuni (rocket)|Zuni]] rockets, but scored hits on all three torpedo boats with their [[Colt Mk 12 cannon|20-mm cannons]], damaging all three boats. \n\nJohnson was informed of the incident and in the first use of the \"hotline\" to Moscow installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis called Khrushchev in the Kremlin to say that the United States did not want war, but he hoped that the Soviets would use their influence to persuade North Vietnam to not attack American warships.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=368-369}} Through Johnson had now an \"incident\" at sea involving a North Vietnamese attack against American warships, he declined to use it as a reason to present a resolution to Congress. Johnson's fear was that the North Vietnamese could claim that the attempted raid on the radar station on Hon Me on 30 July gave them legitimate fears that the ''Maddox'' might have been moving in for a new attack.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Johnson wanted an \"incident\" where it was unambiguous that the North Vietnamese were the aggressors by attacking American warships in waters that the American regarded as international. \n\nOut of the hope of provoking such an incident, Johnson ordered the ''Maddox'' to continue to cruise off the coast of North Vietnam, to be joined by another destroyer, USS ''Turner Joy'' with orders \"to attack any force that attacks them\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Both destroyers were ordered to sail 8 miles from North Vietnam in waters that Americans asserted were international waters, disregarding North Vietnam's claim to the 12-mile limit.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} The Secretary of State, [[Dean Rusk]], ordered his staff to \"pull together\" the resolution Bundy had written in May-June, just in case Johnson decided to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} On 3 August 1963, the South Vietnamese in their Swift boats raided Cape Vinhson and Cua Ron.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} The cruise of the American destroyers was not directly connected to the raid, but Herrick knew from reading the summaries of decrypted North Vietnamese radio messages that the North Vietnamese believed that it was.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} Herrick received orders to \"show the gauntlet\" and prove to the North Vietnamese that the Americans would sail off North Vietnam in waters that the Americans insisted were international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}}\u00a0\n\nTwo days later on a very stormy night on August 4, ''Maddox'' and the destroyer [[USS Turner Joy (DD-951)|''Turner Joy'']] both reported to be under attack again, by North Vietnamese torpedo boats; during this alleged engagement, ''Turner Joy'' fired approximately 220 3-inch & 5-inch shells at radar controlled surface targets.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} In response to the reported attack, aircraft from the ''Ticonderoga''  were launched, but the pilots reported no visual contact with any craft other than the two destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} [[Hanoi]] subsequently insisted that it had not launched a second attack. Through Herrick had reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, he soon developed strong doubts about whatever an attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick reported to Admiral Sharp that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly radar blips due to the \"freak weather effects\" caused by the storm and that an \"overeager\" sonar operator abroad the ''Maddox'' had mistaken the effects of the storm for torpedoes.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick's report concluded with the statement the \"entire action leaves many doubts\" as he noted that no sailor abroad his ship had seen a torpedo boat nor had heard any gunfire beyond the guns of the ''Turner Joy''.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Likewise no sailor abroad the ''Turner Joy'' claimed to have seen any North Vietnamese craft and none of the pilots of the Crusader aircraft stated that they had seen any torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\n\nA later investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] ([[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]]) mission. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing the ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that ''Maddox'' had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the engagement of August 4. The report stated:\n\n{{quote|It is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. ... In truth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.{{sfn|Hanyok|2000|p=3}} }}\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson commented privately: \"For all I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there.\"{{sfn|KQED|2006}}\n\n==Congress votes==\nEarly on the morning of 4 August 1964, Johnson told several congressmen at a meeting that North Vietnam had just attacked an American patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin in international waters and promised retaliation.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} At the same time, Johnson also stated that he wanted Congress to vote for a resolution of support.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} After the meeting, Johnson told one of his aides, [[Kenneth O'Donnell|Kenny O'Donnell]], that he felt he was \"being tested\" by North Vietnam with both agreeing that how the president handled the crisis would affect the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell recalled that Johnson's main fear was the incident might allow his Republican opponent in the election, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], a chance to gain in the polls.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell added that Johnson felt that he \"must not allow them [the Republicans] to accuse him of vacillating or being an indecisive leader\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} \n\nThe equivocal nature of Captain Herrick's reports were a worrisome factor, and Johnson informed McNamara, the member of the cabinet that he trusted the most, to ensure that the naval report remove all of the ambiguous elements.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} In turn, McNamara phoned Admiral Sharp to say the president was keen to launch a retaliatory raid, but could not move \"unless we are dammed sure what happened\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Admiral Sharp in turn applied strong pressure on Herrick to rewrite his report to \"confirm absolutely\" that his patrol had been just attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\u00a0At the same time that Sharp was pressuring Herrick, Johnson had summoned McNamara to the White House to point out to him the best places to bomb in North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} The British ambassador, [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|Lord Harlech]], and the West German ambassador, [[Karl Heinrich Knappstein]], were summoned to the State Department to be told that the United States would be launching a major bombing raid on North Vietnam very soon.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}}\u00a0A press release from the Defense Department accused North Vietnam of a \"second deliberate attack\" on American warships in international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson invited 18 Senators and congressmen led by Mansfield to the White House to inform them he had ordered a bombing raid on North Vietnam and asked for their support for a resolution.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=302-303}} Most were supportive, through Mansfield still had doubts, saying he preferred the matter be referred to the United Nations.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} Rusk assured Mansfield that he would liked to take the matter up at the UN, but the possibility of a Soviet veto at the UN left the president no choice.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} After the meeting, Johnson summoned his National Security Adviser, [[McGeorge Bundy|McGeorge \"Mac\" Bundy]], to tell him: \"You know that resolution your brother's been talking about for the past few months? Well, now's the time to get it through Congress\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}} When Bundy replied \"Mr. President, that seems too fast for me\", Johnson growled \"I didn't ask you that question. I want you to do it\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}}\u00a0 \n\nWithin hours, President Johnson ordered the launching of retaliatory air strikes ([[Operation Pierce Arrow]]) on the bases of the North Vietnamese torpedo boats and announced, in a television address to the American public that same evening, that U.S. naval forces had been attacked. Johnson in his television address announced: \"Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson requested approval of a resolution \"expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia\", stating that the resolution should express support \"for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces\", but repeated previous assurances that \"the United States ... seeks no wider war\". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help \"hostile nations ... understand\" that the United States was unified in its determination \"to continue to protect its national interests\".{{sfn|President's Message to Congress|1964}} \n\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had broken North Vietnam's codes, and McNamara put much emphasis to Johnson on certain decrypts speaking of North Vietnamese torpedo boats having been damaged by American destroyers as proving the second incident happened.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373}} However, several intelligence analysis at the time accused McNamara of having either have misinterpreted, either intentionally or by mistake, decrypts referring to the first incident of 2 August and presenting them as referring to the second alleged incident of 4 August.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373-374}} [[Ray S. Cline]], the deputy director of the CIA later stated: \"I felt from the start that the second incident had been questionable, but I simply wasn't sure. However, after a number of days collating and examining the reports relating to the second incident, I concluded that they were either unsound or that they dealt with the first incident\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Cline was told to keep his doubts to himself.\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Johnson submitted the resolution to Congress, which if passed would give him the legal power to \"take all necessary measures\" and \"prevent further aggression\" as well as allowing him to decide when \"peace and security\" in Southeast Asia were attained.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Johnson commented the resolution was \"like grandma's nightshirt-it covered everything\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Despite his public claims of \"aggression\", Johnson in private believed that the second incident had not taken place, saying at a meeting in the Oval Office in his Texas twang: \"Hell, those dumb stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} The president's two chosen instruments for passing the resolution were the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara had the image of the \"whiz kid\", a man of almost superhuman intelligence and ability whose computer-generated graphs and spreadsheets showed the best way to \"scientifically\" solve any problem.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara, whose statements always seemed to be backed up by the Pentagon's computers had the ability to \"dazzle\" Congress and whatever he requested of Congress tended to be approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Fulbright, through too much an individualist and an intellectual to fit into the Senate's \"Club\", was widely respected as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert and as a defender of Congress's prerogatives.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} If Fulbright backed the resolution, Johnson knew that he would probably carry over the doubters and waverers, of which there were several.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Johnson knew that the conservative Republicans together with the conservative Southern Democrats would vote for the resolution, but he did not want to be dependent upon their support for his foreign policy as his domestic policies were anathema to them.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}\u00a0From Johnson's viewpoint, having liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans vote for the resolution would free his hands to carry out the domestic reforms he wanted to have Congress pass after the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \u00a0\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where the president asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the destroyers had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \"soft on Communism\" and by contrast promised a \"total victory\" over Communism.\u00a0Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright had much contempt for whoever happened to be Secretary of State, always believing that he understood foreign policy better than any of them, and had a particular contempt for Rusk, so the offer to be Secretary of State was tempting for him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} Fulbright also felt a strong rapport with his fellow Southerner Johnson, the first Southern president since Wilson.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} \u00a0Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson told Fulbright he wanted the resolution passed by the widest possible margin to show North Vietnam that Congress was united behind the administration.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Despite all of Johnson's efforts, there was little danger of the resolution not being passed. A public opinion poll at the time showed that 85% of Americans felt that Congress should pass the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn August 6, [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara|Robert S. McNamara]] testified before a joint session of the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] committees. He stated that ''Maddox'' had been \"carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times\" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In his testimony, McNamara accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and of an \"unprovoked attack\" on the destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had been tipped off by a source inside the Pentagon about Operation 34A, and asked McNamara about there was any connection between the activities of the ''Maddox'' and Operation 34A, leading to a blunt denial.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} In response to Morse's question, McNamara answered dismissively: \"Our navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions, if there were any...I say this flatly. This is a fact\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of ''Maddox'', had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called [[Operation 34A|Operation Plan 34A]]. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese [[commando]]s under the control of a [[United States Special Operations Forces|special operations unit]] of the U.S. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] called the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group|Studies and Operations Group]].{{sfn|Andrad\u00e9|Conboy|1999}}\n\nDespite McNamara's statement, Morse appeared before an almost empty Senate later on 6 August 1964 to say: \"The place to settle the controversy is not on the battlefield but around the conference table\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Morse was supported only by Senator [[Ernest Gruening]] who stated in a speech \"all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]], who previously had doubts about Vietnam and whose friendship with Johnson had just been destroyed by the latter's support for the Civil Rights Act, supported the resolution, saying: \"Our national honor is at stake. We cannot and will not shrink from defending it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's thesis, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright called the resolution a mechanism \"calculated to prevent the spread of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \n\nAt a crucial meeting of several Senators, Fulbright was able to persuade them to support the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Several Senators such as [[Allen J. Ellender]], [[Jacob Javits]], [[John Sherman Cooper]], [[Daniel Brewster]], [[George McGovern]] and [[Gaylord Nelson]] were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and at the meeting Fulbright called to discuss the issue, he argued that passing a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Nelson wanted to add an amendment forbidding Johnson from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless Congress gave its approval first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} Fulbright dissuaded him, saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Fulbright argued to Nelson the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} From the viewpoint of Nelson, a liberal Democrat known for his support of environmentalism, Johnson was a far more preferable president than Goldwater, the leader of the right-wing of the Republican Party. \n\nAfter fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] authorizing the president \"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]] requesting assistance in defense of its freedom\". {{Harv|H.J. RES 1145|1964}} The unanimous affirmative vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 416\u20130. (However, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Eugene Siler]] of [[Kentucky]], who was not present but opposed the measure, was [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|\"paired\"]] with another member who favored the resolution\u2014i.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The [[United States Senate|Senate]] conferred its approval by a vote of 88\u20132. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]] and [[Ernest Gruening]] of [[Alaska]] cast the only nay votes.{{sfn|Kenworthy|1964}} At the time, Senator Morse warned that \"I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.\"{{sfn|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} Morse also predicated that those who voted for the resolution \"will love to regret it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Much to Johnson's satisfaction, Senator Goldwater voted for the resolution as appropriate, which allowed the president to present himself as just \"tough on Communism\" as his opponent.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}}\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nAfter the resolution was passed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[John W. McCormack]] called Johnson to congratulate him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} The call was recorded and Johnson spent much time denouncing Morse as mentally unstable and untrustworthy while he called Gruening an ingrate, saying \"He's just no good. I've spent millions on him up in Alaska\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} Rostow was ebullient and stated: \"The second attack probably hadn't happened, but it was the chance to do what we should have been doing all along\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}}\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n==As a policy instrument==\nThe passage of the resolution alarmed several American allies who preferred that the United States not fight in Vietnam such as Canada. [[J. Blair Seaborn]], the Canadian diplomat who served as Canada's representative to the [[International Control Commission]] engaged in secret \"shuttle diplomacy\" carrying messages back and forth from Hanoi to Washington in an attempt to stop the escalation of the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} On 13 August 1964, Seaborn arrived in Hanoi to meet the North Vietnamese Premier, [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn told \u0110\u1ed3ng that based on his recent meetings with Johnson that he was seriously using the powers he just gained from the Gulf of Tonkin resolution to go to war, but also stated that Johnson was willing to offer \"economic and other benefits\" if only North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn further stated that Johnson had told him that North Vietnam would \"suffer the consequences\" if it continued on its \"present course\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}} \u0110\u1ed3ng rejected the offer, saying he would rather see the war engulf \"the whole of Southeast Asia\" than to abandon the vision of one Communist Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}}\n\nThrough Johnson now had the power to wage war in Vietnam, he proved reluctant  to use it, instead hoping that Ambassador Taylor could somehow pressure the South Vietnamese to fight better.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377-378}}  On 11 August 1964, William Bundy wrote a memo on the \"next course of action\", under which predicated that unless South Vietnamese \"morale and momentum\" could be improved, the regime of General Khanh would collapse.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy recommended a programme of gradually increasing escalation to achieve \"maximum results for minimal risks\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy argued for August, the United States should do nothing to \"take onus off the Communist side for escalation\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Starting in September, the memo advocated more DESOTO patrols, 34A raids, and for the United States to start bombing the part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} In January 1965, Bundy stated the \"next move upward\" would begin with a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor objected to Bundy's plan, stating if the U.S started bombing North Vietnam, it would trigger a North Vietnamese response that the South Vietnamese would not be able to handle on their own.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor, who had become increasingly disillusioned with South Vietnam as Khanh drove him to exasperation with his stupidity wrote: \"We should not get involved militarily with North Vietnam and possibly with Red China if our base in South Vietnam is insecure and Khanh's army is tied down everywhere by the Vietcong insurgency\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} General Wheeler and the rest of Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected Taylor's advice and advocated an immediate strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397-398}} On 7 September 1964, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by McNamara, Rusk, Wheeler, the Bundy brothers and Taylor to discuss what to do.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=398}} Taylor conceded that there \"only the emergence of an exceptional leader could improve the situation and there is no George Washington in sight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} The meeting concluded that the U.S. would react \"as appropriate\" against \"any\" attacks against American forces.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} A war game conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1963 code-named Sigma I found that the U.S. would have to commit half-million troops to have a chance of victory in Vietnam; its sequel code-named Sigma II in September 1964 reached the same conclusion and found that despite the claims of General LeMay that a strategical bombing campaign would not be decisive, instead stating that the war would only be won on the ground.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} \u00a0\n\nOn 1 November 1964, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked the American air field at the [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], killing 5 American servicemen and destroying 6 B-57 bombers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402}} Wheeler recommended an immediate bombing campaign against North Vietnam, but Johnson demurred, instead creating a \"working group\" to consider scenarios for American intervention.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402-403}} The conclusion of the \"working group\" chaired by William Bundy when presented in late November resorted to the bureaucratic device of the \"Goldilocks's Principle\" by presenting Johnson with two extreme options of either invading North Vietnam or abandoning South Vietnam; in between the two extremes was the third option of gradual escalation, which Bundy knew that Johnson would chose.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=404}} On 1 December 1964, McNamara, Rusk and \"Mac\" Bundy presented Johnson again with the \"Goldilock's Principle\" by giving him three options, knowing he would chose the third as invading North Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam were too extreme for him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} Johnson agreed to their advice to launch [[Operation Barrel Roll]] to bomb the Lao section of the Ho Chi Minh trail and for more 34A raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} On Christmas Eve 1964, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=408}} Despite almost unanimous advice to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson refused, saying in a cable to Taylor \"The final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}} Johnson added: \"I have never felt that this war will be won from the air, and it seems to me that what is much needed and would be more effective is a larger and stronger use of Rangers and Special Forces and Marines, or other appropriate military strength on the ground and on scene..I know that it might involve the acceptance of larger Americans sacrifices but I myself am ready to substantially increase the Americans in Vietnam if it is necessary to provide this kind of fighting force against the Vietcong\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}}\n\nAs Johnson continued to procrastinate, he repeatedly received advice from McNamara, the Bundy brothers, Rusk, Wheeler and Taylor that now was the time to use his powers under the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409-411}} A memo co-written by \"Mac\" Bundy and McNamara in January 1965 stated \"our present policy can lead only to a disastrous defeat\" with the alternative being either \"salvage what little can be saved\" by withdrawing or to commit American forces to war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=411}} By contrast, Taylor advised Johnson against committing American troops, stating that having the Americans \"carry the ball\" would only encourage South Vietnam's feuding generals to engage in even more in-fighting at the expense of the war effort, thus creating a vicious circle where the Americans would do all the fighting while the ARVN did nothing, leading to a situation where more and more Americans would be needed.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=410}} After a Viet Cong attack on the American air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by his national security team plus Mansfield and McCormack to announce that \"I've had enough of this\" and that he had decided on a bombing campaign.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Only Mansfield and the Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] opposed the plans to bomb North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Johnson ordered [[Operation Flaming Dart]] on 7 February 1965, a bombing raid on a North Vietnamese Army base, which marked the beginning of a series of increasing intense bombing raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} The British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], who was strongly opposed to the United States fighting a war in Asia which would distract American attention from Europe, wrote to Johnson proposing a summit in Washington, where he intended to press Johnson to not use his powers under the resolution to fight war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguthn|2000|p=342}} Johnson phoned Wilson to say the proposed summit was unnecessary, maintaining he could not see \"what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our coattails out\", and instead urged Wilson to send British troops to fight in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguthn|2000|p=342}} On 22 February 1965, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, General [[William Westmoreland]], stated that he had no confidence in the ability of the ARVN to protect the American air base at Danang and asked for two Marine battalions to protect it, a request that Johnson approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 2 March 1965, Johnson ordered [[Operation Rolling Thunder]], the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that had long been urged upon him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 8 March 1965, two battalions of Marines landed at Danang to fulfill Westmoreland's request for troops to protect the air base.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=412}} \n\nFulbright who developed doubts by this point advised Johnson that a \"massive ground and air war in Southeast Asia\" would be a \"disaster\", but Johnson now had the legal power to wage war as he saw fit and disregarded his warning not send any more troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=418}} The Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Wheeler now recommended further troops to Vietnam and on 1 April 1965 Johnson agreed to send 2 more Marine battalions plus 28, 000 logistic troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417}} At the same time, Johnson approved Westmoreland's request for \"offensive defense\" by allowing the Marines to patrol the countryside instead of just guarding the air base, committing the U.S. to a ground war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417-418}} Taylor wrote that Johnson having \"crossed the Rubicon\" with Rolling Thunder \"was now off to Rome on the double\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} On 20 April 1965, Johnson approved a plan to send 40, 000 U.S Army troops to South Vietnam by June.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} In June, Westmoreland reported \"The South Vietnamese armed forces cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial U.S. combat troops on the ground\" and stated that he needed 180, 000 men immediately, a request that was granted in July.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=422-426}} On 28 July 1965, Johnson gave a TV speech saying: \"I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me. And we will meet his needs. We cannot be defeated by force of arms. We will stand in Vietnam\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=426}}\n\nIn February 1966, Morse introduced a motion to repeal the resolution, which he argued was unconstitutional and had been used in ways that Johnson had promised that it would not be.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Through Morse's motion had no chance of passing with Senate Majority Leader Mansfield fatalistically saying \"we are in too deep now\", he was able to extend the debate for two weeks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Morse who was described as a \"skilled parliamentarian\" was able to use various procedural methods to keep the debate going despite Mansfield's efforts, and several senators spoke in favor of the motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Russell complained about the \"very great grant of power\" that the resolution had granted Johnson.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Ultimately, most senators followed Johnson's argument that America was at war and it was the patriotic duty of Congress to support the president, no matter what, and only five senators voted for Morse's motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Repeal ==\n{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}} By 1967, the rationale for what had become a costly U.S. involvement In the [[Vietnam War]] was receiving close scrutiny. With [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]] mounting, a movement to repeal the resolution\u2014which war critics decried as having given the Johnson administration a \"[[blank check]]\"\u2014began to gather steam.\n\nAn investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] collection [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident#The incident|mission off the North Vietnamese coast]].{{sfn|Finney|1968}} It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}}\n\nThe administration of President [[Richard Nixon]], which took office in January 1969, initially opposed repeal, warning of \"consequences for Southeast Asia [that] go beyond the war in Vietnam\". In 1970 the administration began to shift its stance. It asserted that its conduct of operations in Southeast Asia was based not on the resolution but was a constitutional exercise of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief of U.S. military forces, to take necessary steps to protect American troops as they were gradually withdrawn{{sfn|NYT|1970}} (the U.S. had begun withdrawing its forces from Vietnam in 1969 under a policy known as \"[[Vietnamization]]\").\n\nMounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the [[Foreign Military Sales Act of 1971|Foreign Military Sales Act]] that Nixon signed in January 1971.{{sfn|NYT|1971}} Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] in 1973, over [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Richard Nixon|Nixon's veto]]. The War Powers Resolution, which is still in effect, sets forth certain requirements for the President to consult with Congress in regard to decisions that engage U.S. forces in hostilities or imminent hostilities.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|last1=Andrad\u00e9|first1=David|last2=Conboy|first2=Kenneth|url=http://www.usni.org/navalhistory/Articles99/NHandrade.htm|title=The Secret Side of the Tonkin Gulf Incident|publisher=Naval History|date=August 1999|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|last1= Beito|first1=David T.|last2= Beito|first2=Linda Royster |title=The Christian Conservative Who Opposed the Vietnam War|url=http://hnn.us/articles/28879.html|publisher=History News Network|date=August 21, 2006}}\n*{{cite book|last=Berman|first=William|title=William Fulbright and the Vietnam War: The Dissent of a Political Realist|year=1988|publisher=Ohio State University|isbn=0873383516|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite article|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=The Foreign Policy of Senator Wayne L.

[[Outer Western Carpathians]]<br />\n2. [[Inner Western Carpathians]]<br />\n3. [[Outer Eastern Carpathians]]<br />\n4. [[Inner Eastern Carpathians]]<br />\n5. [[Southern Carpathians]]<br />\n6. [[Apuseni Mountains|Western Romanian Carpathians]]<br />\n7. [[Transylvanian Plateau]]<br />\n8. [[Serbian Carpathians]]<br/>\n]]\n\nThe largest range is the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]] in Poland and Slovakia. A major part of the western and northeastern [[Outer Eastern Carpathians]] in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia is traditionally called the [[Eastern Beskids of the Outer Eastern Carpathians|Eastern Beskids]].\n\nThe geological border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians runs approximately along the line (south to north) between the towns of [[Michalovce]], [[Bardejov]], [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]]. In older systems the border runs more in the east, along the line (north to south) along the rivers [[San River|San]] and [[Os\u0142awa]] (Poland), the town of [[Snina]] (Slovakia) and river Tur'ia (Ukraine). Biologists, however, shift the border even further to the east.\n\nThe border between the eastern and southern Carpathians is formed by the [[Predeal]] Pass, south of Bra\u015fov and the [[Prahova Valley]].\n\nIn [[geopolitical]] terms, Carpathian Mountains are often grouped and labeled according to national or regional borders, but such division has turned out to be relative, since it was, and still is dependent on frequent historical, political and administrative changes of national or regional borders. According to modern geopolitical division, Carpathians can be grouped as: Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech, Austrian, and Hungarian. Within each nation, specific classifications of the Carpathians have been developing, often reflecting local traditions, and thus creating terminological diversity, that produces various challenges in the fields of comparative classification and international systematization.\n\nSection of the Carpathians within borders of [[Romania]] is commonly known as the [[Romanian Carpathians]]. In local use, Romanians sometimes denote as \"Eastern Carpathians\" only the Romanian part of the Eastern Carpathians, which lies on their territory (i.e., from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south), which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups (northern, central, southern), instead of Outer and Inner Eastern Carpathians. These groups are:\n* Maramure\u0219-Bukovinian Carpathians (Romanian: ''Carpa\u021bii Maramure\u0219ului \u0219i ai Bucovinei'')\n* Moldavian-Transylvanian Carpathians (Romanian: ''Carpa\u021bii Moldo-Transilvani'')\n* [[Curvature Carpathians]] (Romanian: ''Carpa\u021bii Curburii, Carpa\u021bii de Curbur\u0103'')\n\nSection of the Carpathians within borders of [[Ukraine]] is commonly known as the [[Ukrainian Carpathians]]. Classification of eastern sections of the Carpathians is particularly complex, since it was influenced by several overlapping traditions. Terms like \n[[Wooded Carpathians]], [[Poloniny Mountains]] or [[Eastern Beskids of the Outer Eastern Carpathians|Eastern Beskids]] are often used in varying scopes by authors belonging to different traditions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* {{C|Carpathians|Carpathians topics}}\n* {{C|Mountain ranges of the Carpathians}}\n* {{C|Geology of the Carpathians}}\n* [[Tourism in

The Carpathians, which attain an altitude over {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in only a few places, lack the bold peaks, extensive snowfields, large [[glacier]]s, high waterfalls, and numerous large lakes that are common in the Alps.

[[Serbian Carpathians]]<br/>\n]]\n\nThe largest range is the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]] in Poland and Slovakia. A major part of the western and northeastern [[Outer Eastern Carpathians]] in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia is traditionally called the [[Eastern Beskids of the Outer Eastern Carpathians|Eastern Beskids]].\n\nThe geological border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians runs approximately along the line (south to north) between the towns of [[Michalovce]], [[Bardejov]], [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]]. In older systems the border runs more in the east, along the line (north to south) along the rivers [[San River|San]] and [[Os\u0142awa]] (Poland), the town of [[Snina]] (Slovakia) and river Tur'ia (Ukraine). Biologists, however, shift the border even further to the east.\n\nThe border between the eastern and southern Carpathians is formed by the [[Predeal]] Pass, south of Bra\u015fov and the [[Prahova Valley]].\n\nIn [[geopolitical]] terms, Carpathian Mountains are often grouped and labeled according to national or regional borders, but such division has turned out to be relative, since it was, and still is dependent on frequent historical, political and administrative changes of national or regional borders. According to modern geopolitical division, Carpathians can be grouped as: Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech, Austrian, and Hungarian. Within each nation, specific classifications of the Carpathians have been developing, often reflecting local traditions, and thus creating terminological diversity, that produces various challenges in the fields of comparative classification and international systematization.\n\nSection of the Carpathians within borders of [[Romania]] is commonly known as the [[Romanian Carpathians]]. In local use, Romanians sometimes denote as \"Eastern Carpathians\" only the Romanian part of the Eastern Carpathians, which lies on their territory (i.e., from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south), which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups (northern, central, southern), instead of Outer and Inner Eastern Carpathians.

In 2005, Talbert was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/mary-burnett-talbert/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Mary Burnett Talbert]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n'''Mary Morris Burnett Talbert''' was born in [[Oberlin, Ohio]] in 1866. As the only African-American woman in her graduating class from [[Oberlin College]] in 1886, Burnett received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, then called an S.P. degree. She entered the field of education, first as a teacher in 1886 at [[Shorter College (Arkansas)|Bethel University]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Culp|first=Daniel Wallace|title=Twentieth century Negro literature; or, A cyclopedia of thought on the vital topics relating to the American Negro|year=1902|publisher=J.L. Nichols & Co.|location=Atlanta|page=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/twentiethcentury00culp#page/n25/mode/1up}}</ref>  in Little Rock. She then became assistant principal of the Union High School in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1887, the highest position held by an African-American woman in the state. In 1891, she married William H. Talbert, moved to [[Buffalo, New York]], and joined Buffalo's historic [[Michigan Avenue Baptist Church]].\n\nTalbert earned a higher education degree at a time when a college education was controversial for European-American women and extremely rare for African-American women. When women's organizations  were segregated by race, Talbert was an early advocate of women of all colors working together to advance their cause, and reminded white feminists of their obligations towards their less privileged sisters of color.\n\nDescribed by her peers as \"the best-known colored woman in the United States,\" Talbert used her education and prodigious energies to improve the status of Black people at home and abroad. In addition to her anti-[[lynching]] and anti-[[racism]] work, Talbert supported women's [[suffrage]]. In 1915 she spoke at the \"Votes for Women: A Symposium by Leading Thinkers of Colored Women\" in Washington, D.C. During her national and international lecture tours, Talbert educated audiences about oppressive conditions in African-American communities and the need for legislation to address these conditions. She was instrumental in gaining a voice for African-American women in international women's organizations of her time.\n[[File:Mary Talbert, President of the National Association of Colored Women.jpg|thumb|'''Mary Talbert, President of the National Association of Colored Women.

The Niagara Movement was radical enough in its brief life to both spawn and absorb controversy within the Black community, preparing the way for its successor, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Central to the efforts of both organizations, Mary Talbert helped set the stage for the civil rights gains of the 1950s and 1960s.  Talbert's long leadership of women's clubs helped to develop black female organizations and leaders in communities around New York and the United States.  Women's clubs provided a forum for African-American women's voices at a time when they had restricted opportunities in public and civic life. In both Black and white communities, women's clubs fostered female leadership.\n\nAs a historic preservation pioneer, Talbert saved the [[Frederick Douglass]] home in Anacostia, D.C. after other efforts had failed.  Buffalo's 150-year-old Michigan Avenue Baptist Church, to which the Talbert family belonged, has been named to the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Many prominent African  Americans worshipped or spoke there. The church also had a landmark role in abolitionist activities. In 1998, a marker honoring Talbert, who served as the church's treasurer, was installed in front of the Church by the New York State Governor's Commission Honoring the Achievements of Women.\n\nIn October 2005, Talbert was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in Seneca Falls, New York. She is also remembered around the United States as the namesake of clubs and buildings.\n\nHer honors include: \n* [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) branches named after her in Buffalo, New York; Detroit, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; and New Haven, Connecticut;\n* City Federation of Women's Clubs named after her in Florida and Texas;\n* Talbert Hall at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]];\n* Talbert Mall Housing Development (later renamed Frederick Douglass Towers), Buffalo, New York; and\n* Mary B. Talbert Hospital  (merged with Booth Memorial Hospital, later taken over by Cleveland Metropolitan Hospital), Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nTalbert died on October 15, 1923 and is buried in [[Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo)]]. A small collection of Talbert family papers, concerned mostly with property and estate matters, survives in the Research Library of the [[Buffalo History Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Talbert Family Papers, 1872-1933. |url=https://www.empireadc.org/empiresearch/ead/NBuHi/bechs_b79_4 |accessdate = 2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Progressive Era - Historical Background ==\n[[File:Mary Burnett Talbert.jpg|thumb|Mary Burnett Talbert]]\nThe period in United States history commonly referred to as the Progressive Era spanned from 1890\u20131920.  It represented a progressive shift in what Axinn and Stern (2005) refer to as \"the lines between the countryside and the city, between workers and the middle class, between foreigners and native-born, and between men and women\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p.&nbsp;127).  Not mentioned in this shift is the gruesome treatment of African-Americans under the Southern \"Jim Crow\" laws which excluded Blacks from political, economic, public, and educational spheres of influence.\n\nThese measures represented a tightening of oppressive politics and an era of social subservience, which arguably lasts into the present time.  Discriminatory efforts took shape in black segregation in white social settings and strategically limiting Blacks right to vote with a combination of the grandfather clause, poll taxes and violent efforts at voting sites (Woloch & Johnson, 2009).  Progressive era political reform was seen as necessary, but changing the attitudes and actions toward Blacks in the South was not on this political agenda.\n\nThe hostile environment of the South combined with the loss of jobs and the threat of lynching, encouraged the migration of many Blacks to the north.  It is estimated that from 1890 to 1910, roughly 200,000 African Americans left the South and this number continued to increase during World War I (Woloch & Johnson, 2009). The move north represented employment opportunities in the textile industry, in large factories, automobile production and the famed meat packing industry of New York, but were still not free from the harassment and discrimination that characterized this period of being Black in America.  Axinn and Stern (2005) surmise that \"the Black population was generally unaffected by reform activities and the social welfare benefits that resulted from them.  In an era marked by economic progress and social mobility, the group remained poor and powerless\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p.&nbsp;132).\n\nDespite the bleak picture painted by Axinn and Stern, African-American leadership was not at a shortage and \"powerless\" certainly does not describe the Black pioneers of this era.  Notable Black change agents including [[Booker T. Washington]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[Ida B. Wells]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] helped lead the fight for Black equality and opportunity.  Similarly influential but less well noted activists include [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Nannie Helen Burroughs]] and Mary Morris Burnett Talbert, who is a noted international activist, educator, leader and social reformer.  In a 1916 speech Talbert states, \"no Negro woman can afford to be an indifferent spectator of the social, moral, religious, economic, and uplift problems that are agitated around [her]\"  (Williams, 1994).  Her life's work embodies these principles of dedication and hard work to improve the plight of Blacks and all people during this era.\n\n== A summary of Mary Talbert's accomplishments ==\n*Established the Christian Culture Congress, a literary society and forum in 1901, which brought nationally prominent Black leaders such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and Mary Church Terrell to Buffalo to speak at the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church.\n*Protested the exclusion of Blacks from the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]] Planning Commission, which resulted in the inclusion of a Negro Exhibit to feature cultural and economic achievements of African Americans. During the same year, Talbert lectured at the Biennial Conference of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) in Buffalo as was instrumental in local arrangements\n*Joined the [[Phillis Wheatley Club|Phyllis Wheatley Club]], the first club in Buffalo to affiliate with the NACWC, eventually served as the club's president\n*Co-organized the [[Niagara Movement]], a precursor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]) and the beginning of 20th century American civil rights activism\n*Co-founded Buffalo's first chapter of the NAACP in 1910, as well as NAACP chapters in Texas and Louisiana; elected Board member and vice president of the NAACP; served as National Director of the NAACP Anti-Lynching Campaign in 1921; eighth recipient and first woman to be awarded the highest honor by the NAACP, the [[Spingarn Medal]].\n*Served as a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] nurse and [[YMCA]] secretary in Romagne, France during World War I; offered classes to African-American soldiers; sold thousands of dollars of [[Liberty Bond]]s as a traveling speaker served on the Women's Committee of National Defense.\n*Appointed to the Women's Committee on International Relations, which was responsible for selecting female nominees for positions in the [[League of Nations]]\n*Joined the Empire State Federation of Colored Women as a Charter Member, eventually serving as the Federation's Parliamentarian and President.\n*Elected President (1916\u20131921) of the NACWC; represented the NACWC as the first African-American delegate to the International Council of Women (ICW) at their 5th congress in Norway in 1920\n*Restored the Frederick Douglass home in Anacostia, D.C.; elected president-for-life of the [[Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association]]\n*Lectured in 11 European nations on the conditions of African-Americans in the United States, earning extensive press coverage.\n*Cofounded the International Council of Women of the Darker Races in Washington, D.C., in 1922\n*First Worthy Matron of Naomi Chapter No.10 Prince Hall Order Eastern Star, subordinate chapter of Eureka Grand Chapter Prince Hall Order Eastern Star Inc. State of NY\n\n== Accounts of Mary Talbert's leadership ==\n[[Hallie Quinn Brown]], having the opportunity to befriend Mary Talbert, details a personal side of this phenomenal woman stating,\n\"Mrs. Talbert possessed a kind, thoughtful, generous nature. She did not hesitate to do the smallest deed to the humblest person in any possible way. For if one does not possess these qualities in the small things in life she can never fully expand to the greater ones. Her personality was most charming, her smile an object of beauty.  She possessed a ready and versatile tongue and pen. A letter from her was almost equal to a face to face conversation. She was at once graceful and gracious. By her ability, her oratory and her pleasing personality, she held the undivided attention of an audience\u2026\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Hallie Q. |last2=Washington |first2=Josephine Turpin |title=Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction |date=1926 |publisher=Aldine Pub. Co. |location=Xenia, Ohio |page=251 |url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/brownhal/menu.html |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n   \nCapturing the attention of an audience was not limited to Talbert's speaking engagements; some of her most formidable actions came in the form of letters detailing the strategy and philosophy behind movements such as the anti-lynching crusade.  In a 1922 letter printed in the Crisis magazine, Talbert outlines the urgency of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs commitment to an anti-lynching campaign that did not divide among racial lines.  In the opening lines she asserts: \"The hour has come in America for every woman, white and black, to save the name of her beloved country from shame by demanding that the barbarous custom of lynching and burning at the stake be stopped now and forever\" (Talbert, 1922).\n\nLobbying the support of white woman's organizations, Talbert recognized the human element in lynching that extended beyond race to basic human rights.  Her efforts were bold and likely dangerous as she elicited the contributions of Jewish women and Christian women in what she labeled \"American womanhood\u2026working for one particular objective\u2026\" (Talbert, 1922).  She was well respected in the community of female leaders and [[Mary White Ovington]], also influential in the Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People, expressed to the National Women's Party that \"Mrs. Talbert is able, liberal in thought, and perhaps the best known colored woman in the United States today\" (Ovington, 1920).\n    \nAlthough Talbert was well received in some organizational circles, there were other venues that despite her recognition and champion for women's rights, she was still judged by the color of her skin.  Mary Jane Brown (2000) highlights Talbert's official 1920 trip to Europe to attend the International Council of Women in Christiana, Norway as a delegate.  In Paris, Talbert was with three other white female delegates and was not allowed into a dining room for breakfast because of her race.  In every other country on this tour she was treated well, but not allowed to a tea sponsored by the YWCA in Paris (Brown, 2000, p.&nbsp;39).\n\nThis slice of history raises numerous questions regarding the status of gender and race not only in the United States but in the international community.  Talbert was well aware of national and international perceptions of her prominence and the ideological environment that she sought to advance.  In a short essay titled \"Women and Colored Women,\" Mary Talbert offers her opinion of the gender and race dynamic in terms of women's voting right by stating, \"It should not be necessary to struggle forever against popular prejudice, and with us as colored women, this struggle becomes two-fold, first because we are women and second, because we are colored women.  Although some resistance is experienced in portions of our country against the ballot for women, I firmly believe that enlightened men are now numerous enough everywhere to encourage this just privilege of the ballot for women, ignoring prejudice of all kinds\u2026by her peculiar position the colored woman has gained clear powers of observation and judgment-exactly the sort of powers which are today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal country\" (Talbert, 1915).\n\nMary Talbert was certainly a powerful woman who reflected a lasting commitment toward improving the social welfare of women and African-Americans.  In 1922 her numerous accomplishments were recognized as she became the first black woman to receive the coveted NAACP's [[Spingarn Medal]], not only for her successful work in anti-lynching campaigns but her leadership in the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Colored Women, charter member status of the Empire Federation of Women's Clubs and her headship in preserving and restoring the Frederick Douglass Home in Anacostia as previously mentioned (Williams, 1993).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Axinn, J., & Stern, M.

In 2005, Talbert was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/mary-burnett-talbert/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Mary Burnett Talbert]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n'''Mary Morris Burnett Talbert''' was born in [[Oberlin, Ohio]] in 1866. As the only African-American woman in her graduating class from [[Oberlin College]] in 1886, Burnett received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, then called an S.P. degree. She entered the field of education, first as a teacher in 1886 at [[Shorter College (Arkansas)|Bethel University]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Culp|first=Daniel Wallace|title=Twentieth century Negro literature; or, A cyclopedia of thought on the vital topics relating to the American Negro|year=1902|publisher=J.L. Nichols & Co.|location=Atlanta|page=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/twentiethcentury00culp#page/n25/mode/1up}}</ref>  in Little Rock. She then became assistant principal of the Union High School in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1887, the highest position held by an African-American woman in the state. In 1891, she married William H. Talbert, moved to [[Buffalo, New York]], and joined Buffalo's historic [[Michigan Avenue Baptist Church]].\n\nTalbert earned a higher education degree at a time when a college education was controversial for European-American women and extremely rare for African-American women. When women's organizations  were segregated by race, Talbert was an early advocate of women of all colors working together to advance their cause, and reminded white feminists of their obligations towards their less privileged sisters of color.\n\nDescribed by her peers as \"the best-known colored woman in the United States,\" Talbert used her education and prodigious energies to improve the status of Black people at home and abroad. In addition to her anti-[[lynching]] and anti-[[racism]] work, Talbert supported women's [[suffrage]]. In 1915 she spoke at the \"Votes for Women: A Symposium by Leading Thinkers of Colored Women\" in Washington, D.C. During her national and international lecture tours, Talbert educated audiences about oppressive conditions in African-American communities and the need for legislation to address these conditions. She was instrumental in gaining a voice for African-American women in international women's organizations of her time.\n[[File:Mary Talbert, President of the National Association of Colored Women.jpg|thumb|'''Mary Talbert, President of the National Association of Colored Women.

The Niagara Movement was radical enough in its brief life to both spawn and absorb controversy within the Black community, preparing the way for its successor, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Central to the efforts of both organizations, Mary Talbert helped set the stage for the civil rights gains of the 1950s and 1960s.  Talbert's long leadership of women's clubs helped to develop black female organizations and leaders in communities around New York and the United States.  Women's clubs provided a forum for African-American women's voices at a time when they had restricted opportunities in public and civic life. In both Black and white communities, women's clubs fostered female leadership.\n\nAs a historic preservation pioneer, Talbert saved the [[Frederick Douglass]] home in Anacostia, D.C. after other efforts had failed.  Buffalo's 150-year-old Michigan Avenue Baptist Church, to which the Talbert family belonged, has been named to the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Many prominent African  Americans worshipped or spoke there. The church also had a landmark role in abolitionist activities. In 1998, a marker honoring Talbert, who served as the church's treasurer, was installed in front of the Church by the New York State Governor's Commission Honoring the Achievements of Women.\n\nIn October 2005, Talbert was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in Seneca Falls, New York. She is also remembered around the United States as the namesake of clubs and buildings.\n\nHer honors include: \n* [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) branches named after her in Buffalo, New York; Detroit, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; and New Haven, Connecticut;\n* City Federation of Women's Clubs named after her in Florida and Texas;\n* Talbert Hall at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]];\n* Talbert Mall Housing Development (later renamed Frederick Douglass Towers), Buffalo, New York; and\n* Mary B. Talbert Hospital  (merged with Booth Memorial Hospital, later taken over by Cleveland Metropolitan Hospital), Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nTalbert died on October 15, 1923 and is buried in [[Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo)]]. A small collection of Talbert family papers, concerned mostly with property and estate matters, survives in the Research Library of the [[Buffalo History Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Talbert Family Papers, 1872-1933. |url=https://www.empireadc.org/empiresearch/ead/NBuHi/bechs_b79_4 |accessdate = 2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Progressive Era - Historical Background ==\n[[File:Mary Burnett Talbert.jpg|thumb|Mary Burnett Talbert]]\nThe period in United States history commonly referred to as the Progressive Era spanned from 1890\u20131920.  It represented a progressive shift in what Axinn and Stern (2005) refer to as \"the lines between the countryside and the city, between workers and the middle class, between foreigners and native-born, and between men and women\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p.&nbsp;127).  Not mentioned in this shift is the gruesome treatment of African-Americans under the Southern \"Jim Crow\" laws which excluded Blacks from political, economic, public, and educational spheres of influence.\n\nThese measures represented a tightening of oppressive politics and an era of social subservience, which arguably lasts into the present time.  Discriminatory efforts took shape in black segregation in white social settings and strategically limiting Blacks right to vote with a combination of the grandfather clause, poll taxes and violent efforts at voting sites (Woloch & Johnson, 2009).  Progressive era political reform was seen as necessary, but changing the attitudes and actions toward Blacks in the South was not on this political agenda.\n\nThe hostile environment of the South combined with the loss of jobs and the threat of lynching, encouraged the migration of many Blacks to the north.  It is estimated that from 1890 to 1910, roughly 200,000 African Americans left the South and this number continued to increase during World War I (Woloch & Johnson, 2009). The move north represented employment opportunities in the textile industry, in large factories, automobile production and the famed meat packing industry of New York, but were still not free from the harassment and discrimination that characterized this period of being Black in America.  Axinn and Stern (2005) surmise that \"the Black population was generally unaffected by reform activities and the social welfare benefits that resulted from them.  In an era marked by economic progress and social mobility, the group remained poor and powerless\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p.&nbsp;132).\n\nDespite the bleak picture painted by Axinn and Stern, African-American leadership was not at a shortage and \"powerless\" certainly does not describe the Black pioneers of this era.  Notable Black change agents including [[Booker T. Washington]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[Ida B. Wells]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] helped lead the fight for Black equality and opportunity.  Similarly influential but less well noted activists include [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Nannie Helen Burroughs]] and Mary Morris Burnett Talbert, who is a noted international activist, educator, leader and social reformer.  In a 1916 speech Talbert states, \"no Negro woman can afford to be an indifferent spectator of the social, moral, religious, economic, and uplift problems that are agitated around [her]\"  (Williams, 1994).  Her life's work embodies these principles of dedication and hard work to improve the plight of Blacks and all people during this era.\n\n== A summary of Mary Talbert's accomplishments ==\n*Established the Christian Culture Congress, a literary society and forum in 1901, which brought nationally prominent Black leaders such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and Mary Church Terrell to Buffalo to speak at the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church.\n*Protested the exclusion of Blacks from the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]] Planning Commission, which resulted in the inclusion of a Negro Exhibit to feature cultural and economic achievements of African Americans. During the same year, Talbert lectured at the Biennial Conference of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) in Buffalo as was instrumental in local arrangements\n*Joined the [[Phillis Wheatley Club|Phyllis Wheatley Club]], the first club in Buffalo to affiliate with the NACWC, eventually served as the club's president\n*Co-organized the [[Niagara Movement]], a precursor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]) and the beginning of 20th century American civil rights activism\n*Co-founded Buffalo's first chapter of the NAACP in 1910, as well as NAACP chapters in Texas and Louisiana; elected Board member and vice president of the NAACP; served as National Director of the NAACP Anti-Lynching Campaign in 1921; eighth recipient and first woman to be awarded the highest honor by the NAACP, the [[Spingarn Medal]].\n*Served as a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] nurse and [[YMCA]] secretary in Romagne, France during World War I; offered classes to African-American soldiers; sold thousands of dollars of [[Liberty Bond]]s as a traveling speaker served on the Women's Committee of National Defense.\n*Appointed to the Women's Committee on International Relations, which was responsible for selecting female nominees for positions in the [[League of Nations]]\n*Joined the Empire State Federation of Colored Women as a Charter Member, eventually serving as the Federation's Parliamentarian and President.\n*Elected President (1916\u20131921) of the NACWC; represented the NACWC as the first African-American delegate to the International Council of Women (ICW) at their 5th congress in Norway in 1920\n*Restored the Frederick Douglass home in Anacostia, D.C.; elected president-for-life of the [[Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association]]\n*Lectured in 11 European nations on the conditions of African-Americans in the United States, earning extensive press coverage.\n*Cofounded the International Council of Women of the Darker Races in Washington, D.C., in 1922\n*First Worthy Matron of Naomi Chapter No.10 Prince Hall Order Eastern Star, subordinate chapter of Eureka Grand Chapter Prince Hall Order Eastern Star Inc. State of NY\n\n== Accounts of Mary Talbert's leadership ==\n[[Hallie Quinn Brown]], having the opportunity to befriend Mary Talbert, details a personal side of this phenomenal woman stating,\n\"Mrs. Talbert possessed a kind, thoughtful, generous nature. She did not hesitate to do the smallest deed to the humblest person in any possible way. For if one does not possess these qualities in the small things in life she can never fully expand to the greater ones. Her personality was most charming, her smile an object of beauty.  She possessed a ready and versatile tongue and pen. A letter from her was almost equal to a face to face conversation. She was at once graceful and gracious. By her ability, her oratory and her pleasing personality, she held the undivided attention of an audience\u2026\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Hallie Q. |last2=Washington |first2=Josephine Turpin |title=Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction |date=1926 |publisher=Aldine Pub. Co., |location=Xenia, Ohio: |page=251 |pages=251 |url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/brownhal/menu.html |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n   \nCapturing the attention of an audience was not limited to Talbert's speaking engagements; some of her most formidable actions came in the form of letters detailing the strategy and philosophy behind movements such as the anti-lynching crusade.  In a 1922 letter printed in the Crisis magazine, Talbert outlines the urgency of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs commitment to an anti-lynching campaign that did not divide among racial lines.  In the opening lines she asserts: \"The hour has come in America for every woman, white and black, to save the name of her beloved country from shame by demanding that the barbarous custom of lynching and burning at the stake be stopped now and forever\" (Talbert, 1922).\n\nLobbying the support of white woman's organizations, Talbert recognized the human element in lynching that extended beyond race to basic human rights.  Her efforts were bold and likely dangerous as she elicited the contributions of Jewish women and Christian women in what she labeled \"American womanhood\u2026working for one particular objective\u2026\" (Talbert, 1922).  She was well respected in the community of female leaders and [[Mary White Ovington]], also influential in the Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People, expressed to the National Women's Party that \"Mrs. Talbert is able, liberal in thought, and perhaps the best known colored woman in the United States today\" (Ovington, 1920).\n    \nAlthough Talbert was well received in some organizational circles, there were other venues that despite her recognition and champion for women's rights, she was still judged by the color of her skin.  Mary Jane Brown (2000) highlights Talbert's official 1920 trip to Europe to attend the International Council of Women in Christiana, Norway as a delegate.  In Paris, Talbert was with three other white female delegates and was not allowed into a dining room for breakfast because of her race.  In every other country on this tour she was treated well, but not allowed to a tea sponsored by the YWCA in Paris (Brown, 2000, p.&nbsp;39).\n\nThis slice of history raises numerous questions regarding the status of gender and race not only in the United States but in the international community.  Talbert was well aware of national and international perceptions of her prominence and the ideological environment that she sought to advance.  In a short essay titled \"Women and Colored Women,\" Mary Talbert offers her opinion of the gender and race dynamic in terms of women's voting right by stating, \"It should not be necessary to struggle forever against popular prejudice, and with us as colored women, this struggle becomes two-fold, first because we are women and second, because we are colored women.  Although some resistance is experienced in portions of our country against the ballot for women, I firmly believe that enlightened men are now numerous enough everywhere to encourage this just privilege of the ballot for women, ignoring prejudice of all kinds\u2026by her peculiar position the colored woman has gained clear powers of observation and judgment-exactly the sort of powers which are today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal country\" (Talbert, 1915).\n\nMary Talbert was certainly a powerful woman who reflected a lasting commitment toward improving the social welfare of women and African-Americans.  In 1922 her numerous accomplishments were recognized as she became the first black woman to receive the coveted NAACP's [[Spingarn Medal]], not only for her successful work in anti-lynching campaigns but her leadership in the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Colored Women, charter member status of the Empire Federation of Women's Clubs and her headship in preserving and restoring the Frederick Douglass Home in Anacostia as previously mentioned (Williams, 1993).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Axinn, J., & Stern, M.

{"title_page": "History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes", "text_new": "{{Dome architecture}}\n\nThe early '''domes of the Middle Ages''', particularly in those areas recently under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] control, were an extension of earlier [[Roman architecture]]. The [[dome]]d church architecture of Italy from the sixth to the eighth centuries followed that of the Byzantine provinces and, although this influence diminishes under [[Charlemagne]], it continued on in [[Venice]], [[Southern Italy]], and [[Sicily]]. Charlemagne's [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] is a notable exception, being influenced by Byzantine models from [[Ravenna]] and [[Constantinople]]. The [[Dome of the Rock]], an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Muslim religious shrine built in [[Jerusalem]], was designed similarly to nearby Byzantine [[Martyrium (architecture)|martyria]] and Christian churches. Domes were also built as part of Muslim palaces, throne halls, pavilions, and baths, and blended elements of both Byzantine and [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]], using both [[pendentive]]s and [[squinch]]es. The origin of the [[Dome#Crossed-arch dome|crossed-arch dome type]] is debated, but the earliest known example is from the tenth century at the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]]. In [[Egypt]], a \"[[keel]]\" shaped dome profile was characteristic of [[Fatimid architecture]]. The use of squinches became widespread in the Islamic world by the tenth and eleventh centuries. [[Dome#Onion dome|Bulbous domes]] were used to cover large buildings in [[Syria]] after the eleventh century, following an architectural revival there, and the present shape of the Dome of the Rock's dome likely dates from this time.\n\nChristian domes in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church architecture, especially those of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], are generally octagonal on squinches and hidden externally within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] towers, beginning around 1050. An example is the church of [[San Michele Maggiore, Pavia|San Michele Maggiore]] in [[Pavia]], Italy. [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, with its five domes on pendentives modeled on the Byzantine [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], was built from 1063 to 1072. Domes on pendentives, apparently based upon Byzantine models, appear in the [[Aquitaine]] region of [[France]] after the beginning of the [[Crusades]] in 1095, such as the [[Fontevraud Abbey|abbey church of Fontevrault]], where [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was buried. A series of centrally planned churches were built by the [[Knights Templar]] throughout Europe, modeled on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], with the Dome of the Rock at their [[Temple Mount]] headquarters also an influence. Distinctive domes on pendentives were built in [[Spain]] during the [[Reconquista]]. Also built there were Christian crossed-arch domes similar to that of the earlier Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, such as at the [[:eu:Hilobi Santuaren eliza (Torres del R\u00edo)|Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Torres Del R\u00edo]]. [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. The octagonal dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] was a result of the expansion plans for that church from the 14th century, a part of efforts in [[Tuscany]] to build domes with exposed external profiles.\n\nThe [[muqarnas]] dome type may have originated in [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, but it was popular in [[Greater Maghreb|North Africa and Spain]] with more intricate cell patterns in [[stucco]] on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the [[Moors|Moorish]] palace of the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], Spain, are the 14th century [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters]]. In 14th century Egypt, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s and would construct hundreds of them over the next two and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by [[chamfer]]ed or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, [[ogee]], and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in [[spiral]]s, [[zigzag]]s, and [[Flower|floral]] designs. Bulbous [[minaret]]s from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous [[cupola]]s supporting smaller cupolas or [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] became popular in the sixteenth century.\n\n== Early Middle Ages ==\n=== Post-Roman areas ===\n{{further|Roman architecture|History of Roman and Byzantine domes}}\n[[File:Mausoleum of Theodoric (Ravenna)11.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]].]]\nSeventeen years after the last Western [[Roman Emperor]] was deposed, [[Theodoric the Great]] was the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic]] king of Italy. His building projects largely continued existing architectural conventions. His [[Arian Baptistry]] in [[Ravenna]] (c. 500), for example, closely echoes the [[Baptistry of Neon]] built before it.{{sfn|Barnish|2007|p=12}} Both baptistries are octagonal buildings with [[pyramid]]al roofs concealing interior domes.\n\nThe [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]], however, was understood by contemporaries to be remarkable.{{sfn|Barnish|2007|p=12}} Begun in 520, the {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} dome over the mausoleum was carved out of a single 440-ton slab of [[limestone]] and positioned some time between 522 and 526.{{sfn|Belcari|Marrucchi|2007|p=56}} The low saucer shape of the monolithic dome, which is estimated to be more than 230 tons of [[Istria]]n stone, may have been chosen to avoid radial cracking.{{sfn|Bardill|2008|p=341}} The twelve brackets carved as part of the dome's exterior are thought to have been used to maneuver the piece into place. The choice of large limestone blocks for the structure is significant as the most common construction material in the West at that time was brick. It is likely that foreign artisans were brought to Ravenna to build the structure; possibly from [[Syria]], where such stonework was used in contemporary buildings.{{sfn|Belcari|Marrucchi|2007|p=56}}\n\nThe Syria and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as \"conoid\", or similar to pine cones. When the [[Arab Muslims|Arab Muslim]] forces [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered the region]], they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th&nbsp;century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of [[Islam]]. The rapidity of this adoption was likely aided by the Arab religious traditions, which predate Islam, of both domed structures to cover the burial places of ancestors and the use of a round tabernacle tent with a dome-like top made of red leather for housing [[Cult image|idols]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=43}} Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the [[Umayyad]] period.

It is currently covered in gilded aluminum.{{sfn|Grabar|2006|p=1}}\n\nIn addition to religious shrines, domes were used over the audience and throne halls of Umayyad palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the [[caldarium|calderia]] of baths. Blending the architectural features of both the Byzantine and [[Sassanian architecture|Persian architecture]], the domes used both pendentives and [[squinch]]es and were made in a variety of shapes and materials.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} A dome stood at the center of the palace-city of Baghdad and, similarly but on a smaller scale, there are literary accounts of a domed audience hall in the palace of [[Abu Muslim Khorasani|Abu Muslim]] in [[Merv]] at the meeting point of four iwans arranged along the cardinal directions.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=196}}{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=19}}\n\nMuslim palaces included domical halls as early as the eighth century, well before domes became standard elements of mosque architecture. The early eighth century palace of [[Khirbat al-Minya]] included a domed gateway. The palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]] and a ninth century palace at [[Samarra]] included domed throne rooms. A domed structure covered a shallow pool in the main courtyard of the mid eighth century palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]]. Similar examples at mosques, such as the domed fountains at the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (destroyed in 987 and replaced with a different structure), at [[Great Mosque of Maarrat al-Numan|Maarrat al-Numan]], in [[Nishapur]], [[Tripoli]], and at the [[Umayyad Mosque|Mosque of Damascus]] seem to be related to this element of palace architecture, although they were later used as part of [[Wudu|ritual ablution]].{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=195-196}}\n\nThe calderia of early Islamic bath complexes at Amra, Sarraj, and [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] were roofed with stone or brick domes.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} The caldarium of the early Islamic bath at [[Qasr Amra]] contains \"the most completely preserved astronomical cupola decoration\", a decorative idea for bath domes that would long continue in the Islamic world.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=254}}\n\nThe placement of a dome in front of the [[mihrab]] of a mosque probably began with the rebuilding of the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in [[Medina]] by [[Al-Walid I|Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid]]. This was likely to emphasize the place of the ruler, although domes would eventually become focal points of decoration and architectural composition or indicate the direction of prayer. Later developments of this feature would include additional domes oriented axially to the mihrab dome.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194-195}} Byzantine workmen built the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] and its hemispherical dome for al Walid in 705.

Domed examples include the mosques at Sarmin (1305-6) and al-Bab (1305). The typical Damascus dome is smooth and supported by a double zone of squinches: four squinches create an eight sided transition that includes eight more squinches, and these create a sixteen-sided drum with windows in alternate sides.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=111-112}}\n\n=== Byzantine influence in Europe ===\n{{further|History of Roman and Byzantine domes}}\nItalian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans.

Later alterations to the mosque have changed its original form.{{sfn|Kuban|1985|p=1}} The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}}\n\nEgypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} Fatimid mausoleums, many of which have survived in [[Aswan]] and [[Cairo]], were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid \"keel\" shape profile.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p=165}} The first were built in and around [[Fustat]]. Those inside the city were decorated with carved stucco and contrast with the extreme simplicity of those outside the city, such as the four so-called Sab'a Banat (c. 1010) domed squares. Those at Aswan, mostly from the 11th century, are more developed, with ribbed domes, star-shaped openings, and octagonal drums with concave exterior sides which are corbeled outward at the top.

Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base.{{sfn|Fregonese|Taffurelli|2009}} These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until [[Fourth Crusade|after 1204]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=407}} The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen from a great distance.{{sfn|Fregonese|Taffurelli|2009}} In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved weather protection.

This became increasingly popular as a Romanesque feature over the course of the next fifty years. The first [[Lombardy|Lombard]] church to have a [[lantern tower]], concealing an octagonal cloister vault, was [[San Nazaro in Brolo|San Nazaro]] in [[Milan]], just after 1075. Many other churches followed suit in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, such as the Basilica of [[San Michele Maggiore]] in [[Pavia]] (the coronation church of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy within the Holy Roman Empire]]) and the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. At Sant'Ambrogio, the original plan for the church did not include a domed crossing and it was modified to include one, as also happened at [[Pisa Cathedral#Duomo|Pisa Cathedral]] (funding for which was provided by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] in 1089 and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry V]] in 1116) and [[Speyer Cathedral]] (the burial church of the [[Salian dynasty]] of Holy Roman Emperors). The crossing domes at Pavia, Pisa, and Speyer were all completed around 1080 but the exact order of precedence is unresolved.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=201, 203, 207}}\n\nThe domes of Pisa Cathedral and Florence Baptistery may be the two earliest domes in [[Tuscany]] and were the two largest until about 1150.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=201-202}} Pisa Cathedral, built between 1063 and 1118, includes a high [[ellipse|elliptical]] dome at the crossing of its nave and transept. The marble dome was one of the first in [[Romanesque architecture]] and is considered the [[masterpiece]] of Romanesque domes. Rising 48&nbsp;meters above a rectangular bay, the shape of the dome was unique at the time.{{sfn|Fossi|2008|p=86}} The rectangular bay's dimensions are 18 meters by 13.5 meters. Squinches were used at the corners to create an elongated octagon in a system similar to that of the contemporary Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan and corbelling was used to create an oval base for the dome. The tambour on which the dome rests dates to between 1090 and 1100, and it is likely that the dome itself was built at that time. There is evidence that the builders did not originally plan for the dome and decided on the novel shape to accommodate the rectangular crossing bay, which would have made an octagonal cloister vault very difficult. Additionally, the dome may have originally been covered by an octagonal lantern tower that was removed in the 1300s, exposing the dome, to reduce weight on foundations not designed to support it. This would have been done no later than 1383, when the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] loggetta on the exterior of the dome was added, along with the buttressing arches on which it rests.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=197-200, 202, 206}}\n\n[[File:Baptist\u00e8re Saint-Jean (Florence) - 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Florence Baptistery]] in Italy.]]\n\nAn aspiring competitor to Pisa, the city of Florence took the opposite side in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|the conflict between Pope and Emperor]], siding with the [[Pope]] in Rome.

Its ratio of wall thickness to external diameter is about 1/10, in accordance with the rules of dome proportion followed until the 17th century. One of the most important religious buildings in Florence, the proportions of its dome were followed by the nearby dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore that was built by Brunelleschi centuries later. The polygonal dome was built with a wooden tension ring at about 23 meters high, too high to counteract the spreading forces, and a lower iron ring was added in 1514.{{sfn|Ottoni|Blasi|Betti|Bartoli|2016|pp=1802, 1806}}\n\n[[File:Speyer Dom BW 7.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Speyer Cathedral]] in Germany.]]\n\nThe renovation of Speyer Cathedral, the largest of the [[Imperial Cathedrals]] of the Holy Roman Empire, was begun around 1080 by the Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], soon after he had returned from a [[Walk to Canossa|trip to Canossa]] in northern Italy. Although the church had only just been consecrated in 1061, Henry called upon craftsmen from across the empire for its renovation. The redesign included two octagonal cloister vaults within crossing towers, one at the east crossing with an external dwarf gallery and one at the west end. This was very soon imitated elsewhere and became the model for later [[Rhineland|Rhenish]] octagonal domes, such as those of [[Worms Cathedral]] (c. 1120&ndash;1181) and [[Mainz Cathedral]] (c. 1081&ndash;1239).{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=140-141, 151, 156}} Many German Imperial cathedrals feature domes at their crossings.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}}\n\nChurches in northern Italy after 1100 were designed with vaulting from the outset, rather than as colonnaded basilicas with timber roofs and, like the Rhenish imperial cathedrals, many have octagonal domes with squinches over their crossings or choirs.

Much admired in the Renaissance, its dome collapsed in 1573 and was rebuilt with the present cloister vault.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=296-297}} Documentary evidence indicates that the Romanesque dome of San Lorenzo was a thin hemisphere of light material over a cube of space about 23.8 meters (40 Milanese braccia) on each side. The dome was supported by four corner squinches resting on the four [[Exedra|exedrae]] arches of the square space with a further eight smaller squinches between each of them to create a sixteen-sided base. It was covered on the exterior by a cylindrical or polygonal drum and timber roof. The exterior drum was likely polygonal, with eight or sixteen sides, and had two levels of [[Dwarf gallery|dwarf galleries]] beneath a cornice row of [[Lombard band|hanging arches]]. Evidence remains in the building's eastern corner towers of [[flying buttress]]es extending diagonally to the drum.

It served as a model for the later Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo.{{sfn|Saalman|1987|pp=376, 386-387}}\n\n==== Influence of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ====\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem seems to have had a wooden dome in two shells up to the 12th century, with some interruptions. After their establishing control of the city, the crusaders added a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with a dome next to the existing rotunda.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=16-22}} The [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in France|French Romanesque]] addition replaced the eastern apse of the rotunda and a courtyard marking the [[Omphalos#Jerusalem|center of the world]] and was consecrated on July 15, 1149, the fiftieth anniversary of the capture of the city. The new dome's diameter of 10.4 meters was half that of the rotunda and it rested on four pointed arches on four pillars. It served as the coronation site for the crusader [[King of Jerusalem|kings of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Kenaan-Kedar|1986|p=110, 114}}\n\nThe rotunda itself was covered by a conical structure from the 12th to the early 19th century. [[Pisa Baptistry]] was built in 1153 with a truncated cone in clear imitation of the Holy Sepulchre; an outer dome shell was added in the 14th century. The domed baptisteries of Cremona (1176) and Parma (1196) also appear to have been influenced by the rotunda.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=5, 31-32}} The 12th century rotunda of the Holy Sepulchre at [[Santo Stefano, Bologna]], and the basilica at [[Neuvy-Saint-S\u00e9pulchre]] are imitations of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre although, like many of the imitations across Europe, they differ in their details, including their domes.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=5, 7}}\n\nThe [[Dome of the Rock]] and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the [[Temple Mount]] of Jerusalem were taken by the crusaders to represent the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]] and the [[Solomon#Building and other works|Palace of Solomon]], respectively. The [[Knights Templar]], headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=65, 67}} Examples include the church of the [[:es:Iglesia de la Vera Cruz (Segovia)|Vera Cruz at Segovia]], the church of the [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Convento do Cristo at Tomar]], a rotunda church in Paris destroyed during the French Revolution, and [[Temple Church]] in London. The [[Church of Saint Mary of Eunate]] was a pilgrims' burial church, rather than a Templar church, but may have been influenced by them.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=334, 335}}\n\n==== Aquitaine ====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre d'Angoul\u00eame durant le festival International de la Bande Dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame 2013 19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The nave of [[Angoul\u00eame Cathedral]].]]\n\nIn the [[Aquitaine]] region of southwest France, there are a large number of unusual domed Romanesque churches; over 250 in the [[P\u00e9rigord]] region alone. The area is far from ports with regular contact with the East and the source of influence is not entirely settled.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=18-20, 202}} A study in 1976 of Romanesque churches in [[Southern France|the south of France]] documented 130 with oval plan domes, such as the domes on pendentives at [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Martin de Saint-Martin-de-Gurson|Saint-Martin-de-Gurson, Dordogne]] and [[Balzac, Charente#Sites and monuments|Balzac, Charente]].{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=219}} The oval shape appears to have been a practical solution to rectangular crossing bays.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=244}} The use of pendentives to support domes in the Aquitaine region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}}\n\nBetween the [[Garonne]] and [[Loire]] rivers there are known to have been at least seventy-seven churches whose naves were covered by a line of domes. Half of them are in the P\u00e9rigord region. Most date to the twelfth century and sixty of them survive today.{{sfn|Stephenson|2010|p=390}} That the domes in this area were arranged in linear series has suggested the contemporary architecture of [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]] as the inspiration, which was located on a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] route to the [[Holy Land]].{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=284}} Cyprus had developed its own style of domed basilica during its [[Condominium (international law)|period of neutrality]] between Byzantine and Arab rulers, using three domes of roughly equal size in a line over the nave and very little lighting. There are indications of a connection between Aquitaine and Cyprus just after the First Crusade.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=20, 178, 198}}\n\nThe earliest of these French churches may be [[Angoul\u00eame Cathedral]], built from 1105 to 1128. Its long nave is covered by four stone domes on pendentives, springing from pointed arches, the last of which covers the crossing and is surmounted by a stone lantern.{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}}{{sfn|Browne|2005|p=}} [[Cahors Cathedral]] (c. 1100\u20131119) covers its nave with two large domes in the same manner and influenced the later building at [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]].{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}} The [[abbey]] church at [[Fontevraud Abbey|Fontevrault]] served as a burial place for [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet royalty]], including [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], and is one of the most impressive examples. The earlier domed crossing is preceded by a wider nave covered by four domes, which was begun in 1125. The pendentives are original, but the four nave domes are modern replacements from about 1910.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=288}} The [[P\u00e9rigueux Cathedral|cathedral of S. Front at P\u00e9rigueux]] was built c. 1125\u20131150 and derives its five-domed cruciform plan ultimately from the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}} {{sfn|Ward|1915|p=117}}\n\n==== Spain ====\n[[File:Catedral Vieja - Salamanca.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dome over the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca|Cathedral of Salamanca]].]]\n[[File:Castillo de la Atalaya.

C\u00fapula almohade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Intersection of the dome arches inside the [[Atalaya Castle (Spain)]] of [[Villena]].]]\n\nThe remains of a crossing tower on the French [[Church of Saint-Jean de Montierneuf]] from about 1140 suggest an origin for some Spanish domes in a Romanesque and transitional Gothic style.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=323, 325, 328}} The architectural influences at work here have been much debated, with proposed origins ranging from Jerusalem, Islamic Spain, or the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] region in western France to a mixture of sources.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} During the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] in northern Spain built three churches famous for their domed crossing towers, called \"cimborios\", as it acquired new territories. The [[Cathedral of Zamora]], the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca|Cathedral of Salamanca]], and the [[Colegiata de Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor (Toro)|collegiate church of Toro]] were built around the middle of the 12th century. All three buildings have stone umbrella domes with sixteen ribs over windowed drums of either one or two stories, springing from pendentives. All three also have four small round towers engaged externally to the drums of the domes on their diagonal sides.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=410}} Perhaps the masterpiece of the series, the Salamanca crossing tower has two stories of windows in its drum. Its outer stone fish-scale roof lined with gothic [[crocket]]s is a separate corbelled layer with only eight lobes, which applies weight to the haunches of the sixteen-sided inner dome.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=328}}\n\nAnother unusual Spanish example from the late 12th or early 13th century is the dome of the [[:eu:Hilobi Santuaren eliza (Torres del R\u00edo)|Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Torres Del R\u00edo]], on the [[Way of St. James]]. The Way, a major [[pilgrimage]] route through northern Spain to the reputed burial place of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Greater]], attracted pilgrims from throughout Europe, especially after pilgrimage to Jerusalem was cut off. The difficulty of travel to Jerusalem for pilgrimage prompted some new churches to be built as a form of substitute, evoking the central plan and dome of Jerusalem's [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] with their own variant. The dome in this case, however, is most evocative of the central mihrab dome of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]]. Over an octagonal room, the stone dome is formed by sixteen ribs, eight of which intersect with one another in a star pattern to define a smaller octagon at the center of the dome.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=173}} This is one of a number of Christian crossed-arch dome examples in Spain and the south of France from the end of the 12th century, with patterns based upon the square or octagon. Other examples include the domes of San Miguel de [[Almaz\u00e1n]], [[:fr:\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix d'Oloron|Santa Cruz de Olor\u00f3n]], and [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Blaise de L'H\u00f4pital-Saint-Blaise|San Blas Hospital]]. Contemporary Islamic examples in [[Almohad Caliphate|Spain and North Africa]] are distinguished from the Christian by the use of thinner and more numerous arches, such as those of the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], the [[Atalaya Castle (Spain)|Villena Castle in Alicante]], the [[Great Mosque of Taza]], and the minaret of [[Koutoubia Mosque]]. The style experienced a revival in early 16th century Spain when one of the crossed-arch domes of the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba was used as the model for domes at [[La Seo Cathedral|Zaragoza]], [[Teruel Cathedral|Teruel]], and [[Tarazona Cathedral|Tarazona]].{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=347}}\n\n=== Sicily ===\n\nThe Christian domed basilicas built in Sicily after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman Conquest]] also incorporate distinctly Islamic architectural elements. They include hemispherical domes positioned directly in front of apses, similar to the common positioning in mosques of domes directly in front of mihrabs, and the domes use four squinches for support, as do the domes of Islamic [[Maghreb|North Africa]] and Egypt. In other cases, domes exhibit Byzantine influences with tall drums, engaged columns, and blind arcades.{{sfn|Nicklies|2004|p=107}} Examples at [[Palermo]] include the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]] (1132\u20131143), [[Martorana|La Martorana]] (c. 1140s), and [[Zisa, Palermo]] (12th century).{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=105-106}}{{sfn|Swoboda|1961|p=88}} The church of [[San Giovanni degli Eremiti]] has five domes in a T-shaped arrangement and the [[Chiesa di San Cataldo|Church of San Cataldo]] has three domes on squinches, with both showing clearly Islamic influence.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=302}}\n\n=== North Africa, Syria, and Al-Jazira ===\n[[File:Kuppel Nur ad-Din Madrasa.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Nur al-Din Madrasa|mausoleum of Nur al-Din]] in Damascus.]]\n\nThe so-called shrine of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Imam al-Dawr]] in the village of [[Ad-Dawr|al-Dawr]], Iraq, is the earliest known example of a [[muqarnas]] dome, although it is unlikely to have been the first of its type. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by four squinches over a square bay. Three levels of muqarnas rise over this and are capped by a small cupola. The muqarnas cells are very large and resemble small squinches themselves. It was finished by 1090 by the court of an [[Uqaylid Dynasty|Uqaylid]] vassal of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] of Baghdad and, although there are no surviving examples from Baghdad at this time, the large number of muqarnas domes known to have existed there by the end of the Middle Ages suggests that it could have been the source of the type.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=62-63}}\n\nIn Islamic North Africa, there are several early muqarnas domes dating from the twelfth century. The earliest may be an [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] restoration between 1135 and 1140 of a series of stucco muqarnas domes over the axial nave of the mosque of the [[University of al-Karaouine|Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes|Fez]]. The existence of a near contemporary example from 1154 in the maristan of [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo|Nur al-din]] in Damascus, Syria, and the earlier example of a muqarnas dome in al-Dawr, Iraq, suggests that the style was imported from Baghdad.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=62-65}}\n\nMost of the examples of muqarnas domes are found in Iraq and [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazira]], dated from the middle of the twelfth century to the [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]]. The use of stucco to form the muqarnas pattern, suspended by a wooden framework from the exterior vault, was the least common in Iraq, although it would be very popular in North Africa and Spain. Because it used two shells, however, windows were restricted to the bases of the domes. They were otherwise used frequently in this type. In Iraq, the most common form was a single shell of brick, with the reverse of the interior pattern visible on the exterior. The Damascus [[Nur al-Din Madrasa|mausoleum of Nur al-Din]] (1172) and the shrine of Zumurrud Khatun in Baghdad are examples. A third type is found only in [[Mosul]] from the beginning of the thirteenth century. It has a brick pyramidal roof, usually covered in green glazed tiles. Of the five preserved examples, the finest is the shrine of Awn al-Din, which used tiny colored tiles to cover the muqarnas cells themselves and incorporates small muqarnas domes into the tiers of muqarnas supporting the large eight-sided star at the center. This design led to a further development at the shrine of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani|Shaykh Abd al-Samad]] in Natanz, Iran.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=65, 67}}\n\nThe architecture of Syria and [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazira]] includes the widest variety of forms in the medieval Islamic world, being influenced by the surviving architecture of [[Late Antiquity]], contemporary Christian buildings, and Islamic architecture from the east. There are some muqarnas domes of the Iraqi type, but most domes are slightly pointed hemispheres on either muqarnas pendentives or double zones of squinches and made of masonry, rather than brick and plaster. The domes cover single bay structures or are just a part of larger constructions. Syrian mausoleums consist of a square stone chamber with a single entrance and a mihrab and a brick lobed dome with two rows of squinches. The dome at the [[Silvan, Diyarbak\u0131r|Silvan]] Mosque, 13.5 meters wide and built from 1152\u20131157, has an unusual design similar to the dome added to the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan|Friday Mosque of Isfahan]] in 1086-1087: once surrounded by roofless aisles on three sides, it may have been meant to be an independent structure. The congregational mosque at [[K\u0131z\u0131ltepe]], with its well integrated dome of about 10 meters, is the masterpiece of [[Artuqids|Artuqid]] architecture.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=112, 115-116}}\n\nThe largest preserved [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] dome is that of the Matbakh al-'Ajami in [[Aleppo]], resting on muqarnas pendentives. It may have been the palace residence of the al-'Ajami family.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=115}} The mausoleum over the tomb of Iman [[Al-Shafi\u2018i]] (built in 1211) has a large wooden double dome (rebuilt in 1722) about 29 meters high and, with the tombs of [[As-Salih Ayyub|al-Malik al-Silah]] and the so-called Tomb of the Abassid Caliphs, is one of three important Ayyubid tombs in Cairo dating from the first half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=319}}{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=333-334}} The domed mausoleum was built 35 years after the [[Madrasa|madrassa]] ordered by [[Saladin]] at the site in 1176\u20137, which were introduced in Egypt after 1171 to counter [[Shia Islam]]. The only madrassa from the period to partly survive is the 1242 construction by [[As-Salih Ayyub]] on the site of the Fatimid Eastern Palace. The 10 meter wide domed tomb at its northern end led to the series of funerary madrassas built in Cairo by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultans]].{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=108}}\n\n=== Late Romanesque and early Gothic Europe ===\nThe use of domes declined in Western Europe with the rise of [[Gothic architecture]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of [[rib vault]]s over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} Spaces of circular or octagonal plan were sometimes covered with vaults of a \"double chevet\" style, similar to the [[Apse#Chevet|chevet apse]] vaulting in Gothic cathedrals. The crossing of [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Nicolas de Blois|Saint Nicholas at Blois]] is an example.{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=117}} The domed \"Decagon\" nave of [[St. Gereon's Basilica]] in [[Cologne]], Germany, a ten-sided space in an oval shape, was built between 1219 and 1227 upon the remaining low walls of a 4th-century Roman mausoleum. The ribbed domical vault rises four stories and 34 meters above the floor, covering an oval area 23.5 meters long and 18.7 meters wide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=172-173}} It is unique among the [[Twelve romanesque churches of Cologne|twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne]], and in European architecture in general, and may have been the largest dome built in this period in Western Europe until the completion of the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]].{{sfn|Hayes|2009}}{{sfn|Schmitz|1985|p=49}}\n\n[[File:Duomo di siena, cupola, interno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The dome of [[Siena Cathedral]].]]\n\nIn Italy, the dome of [[Siena Cathedral]] had an exposed profile as early as 1224, and this feature was retained in its reconstruction around 1260.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=204}} The dome has two shells and was completed in 1264.

Similar to [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, its nave, transepts, crossing, and the intermediate bay before the choir are covered by domes on pendentives in the Byzantine style. Externally, the crossing dome is covered with a conical spire. The choir dome, which may be later than the others, is uniquely Gothic with ribs.{{sfn|Willis|1835|p=137-138}}\n\nIn England, a dome with a pyramidal roof and lantern at the Abbot's kitchen of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] dates to the early 14th century.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=39}} Similar vaulting was built over the kitchen of [[Newenham Abbey]] by 1338.{{sfn|Davidson|1843|p=151}} Timber star [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s such as those over [[York Minster]]'s octagonal [[Chapter house]] (ca. 1286\u20131296) and the elongated octagon plan of [[Wells Cathedral]]'s Lady Chapel (ca. 1320\u20131340) imitated much heavier stone vaulting.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} The wooden vaulting over the crossing of [[Ely Cathedral]] was built after the original crossing tower collapsed in 1322.

The [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes]] (c. 1333\u201391) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333\u201354) are extraordinarily developed examples of [[muqarnas]] domes, taking the tradition of the squinch in Islamic architecture from a functional element in the zone of transition to a highly ornamental covering for the dome itself. The structural elements of these two domes are actually brick vaulting, but these are completely covered by the intricate [[moc\u00e1rabe]] stalactites. The lacy and star-shaped crossing dome of [[Burgos Cathedral]] (1567) may have been inspired by these examples, in addition to that built over the cathedral's octagonal Chapel of the Condestable (1482&ndash;94) in the Gothic style.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}}\n\nIn the [[mud\u00e9jar]] style of Seville after [[Siege of Seville|the Christian reconquest of the city]], a kind of dome made of intricately interlaced pieces of painted and gilded wood was known as a ''media naranja'', or \"half orange\". The most famous example covers the \"[[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville#Salon de Embajadores|Hall of the Ambassadors]]\" throne room in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Royal Palace Complex of Seville]], a 10 meter wide space built in 1427.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=210}}\n\n=== Mamluk Sultanate ===\n[[File:Dome of Qaytbay complex.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The dome of [[Qaitbay|Qaytbay]] in Cairo's northern cemetery.]]\n\nIn the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]], with the brick domes being only 20 percent of those constructed around 1322. Over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s. Although they kept roughly the same proportions, the shift from brick to stone is also associated with an increase in the average span and height of about 3 to 4 meters, and a decrease in the thickness of the domes. The stone domes are generally 8 to 10 meters in diameter and 7 to 11 meters high. The Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq (1398\u20131411) is an exceptional case, with a dome 16 meters wide and 12.8 meters tall.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=696, 698}}\n\nThe stone domes are generally single shells except at the conical crown, where there is a gap between inner and outer layers filled with earth and rubble and which contains the bases of the metal spires. Double shelled domes are rare, but an example is that of Al-Sultanyya Madrasa from 1360. The domes were constructed in circular rings, with the sizes decreasing towards the top of the dome and, because of this, it is possible that elaborate centering may not have been needed. Collapsed remains of some domes has revealed a layer of brick beneath the external stone, which could have supported and aligned the heavier stone during construction. Although the earliest stone domes do not have them, horizontal connections between the ashlar stone blocks were introduced in the fourteenth century, such as those made of [[teak]] wood in a dovetail shape used in the Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=698, 709, 712-713}} Dome profiles were varied, with \"keel-shaped\", bulbous, [[ogee]], stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were [[chamfer]]ed, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318}}\n\nDecoration for these first stone domes was initially the same external ribbing as earlier brick domes, and such brick domes would continue to be built throughout the Mamluk period, but more elaborate patterns of carving were introduced through the beginning of the sixteenth century. Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time would make this unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and [[zigzag]] patterns were common both by the end of the fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=699-700, 714}}\n\nThe twin-domes of the Sultaniyya complex (c. 1360) and the narrow dome of Yunus al-Dawadar (c. 1385) are unusual in that they have [[muqarnas]] at the base of their external ribs, a feature of ribbed domes in Persia. The first example of the zigzag pattern is on the dome of Mahmud al-Kurdi (1394\u201395), and at least fourteen subsequent domes also used it. The first example of a dome in Cairo with a star pattern is the mausoleum of [[Barsbay|al-Ashraf Barsbay]]. The dome of [[Qaitbay|Qaytbay]] in Cairo's northern cemetery combines geometric and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] patterns and is one of the finest.{{sfn|O'Kane|2012|p=4, 8, 9, 11, 15}} Internally, the squinches of the zone of transition developed into miniaturized and pointed versions that were used row upon row over the entire expanded zone and bordered above and below by plain surfaces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318-319}} Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n==== Tuscany ====\n[[File:Pisa Campo Miracoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The domes of [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Baptistery|Pisa Baptistery]] and [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Cathedral|Cathedral]].]]\n\nExposed domes were common in [[Tuscany]] and a source of regional distinctiveness by the 1380s.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} The exposed outer dome of [[Pisa Baptistry|Pisa Baptistery]] was built over its earlier inner conical roof in the 14th century.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=32}} If an external lantern tower was also removed from [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Cathedral|Pisa Cathedral]] in the 1300s, exposing the dome, one reason may have been to stay current with more recent projects in the region, such as the domed cathedrals of Siena and Florence. {{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} Rapid progress on a radical expansion of Siena Cathedral, which would have involved replacing the existing dome with a larger one, was halted not long after the city was struck with an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in 1348.{{sfn|Norman|1995|p=137}} Its dome was originally topped with a copper orb, similar to that over Pisa's dome today, but this was replaced in 1385 by a cupola surmounted by a smaller [[Globus cruciger|sphere and cross]].{{sfn|Carli|2003|p=25}} \n\nIt was only a few years after the city of Siena had decided to abandon the massive expansion and redesign of their cathedral in 1355 that Florence decided to greatly expand theirs.{{sfn|Norman|1995|p=136}} A plan for the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] was settled by 1357.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} However, in 1367 it was proposed to alter the church plan at the east end to increase the scale of the octagonal dome, widening it from 62 to 72 braccia, with the intent to further surpass the domes of Pisa and Siena, and this modified plan was ratified in 1368, under Master of Works [[Francesco Talenti]].{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}}{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} The construction guilds of Florence had sworn to adhere to the model of the dome created in 1367, with a \"quinto acuto\" pointed profile, but the scale of this new dome was so ambitious that experts for the ''Opera del Duomo'', the board supervising the construction, expressed the opinion as early as 1394 that the dome could not be accomplished.{{sfn|Salvadori|Hooker|Ragus|1990|p=233-234}} Discussion in the fourteenth century revolved primarily around the cost of the project, and secondarily about the style.{{sfn|Cowan|1977|p=8}} The enlarged dome would span the entire {{convert|42|m|adj=on}} width of the three aisled nave, just 2 meters less than that of the Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the largest dome in the world.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} And because the distances between the angles of the octagon were even farther apart at {{convert|45.5|m}}, the average span of the dome would be marginally wider than that of the Pantheon.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=123}} At 144 braccia, the height of the dome would evoke the holy number of the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly Jerusalem]] mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. By 1413, with the exception of one of the three apses, the east end of the church had been completed up to the windowed octagonal drum but the problem of building the huge dome did not yet have a solution.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} In 1417, with the drum completed, the master builder in charge of the project retired and a competition for plans to build the dome was begun in August 1418.{{sfn|Gentry|Lesniewski|2011|p=}}{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} \n\n[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|right|The Cathedral of [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence.]]\n[[Florence Cathedral#Dome|Brunelleschi's dome]], designed in 1418, follows the height and form mandated in 1367.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}}{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1420. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}} The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome.{{sfn|Gentry|Lesniewski|2011|p=}} \n\nAlthough generally preferred in Italy at the time, no visible internal ties were used.{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{sfn|Como|2013|p=190}} The design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, but it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built.{{sfn|Chant|Goodman|1999|p=166, 169}} The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}} The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}} It was completed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolommeo]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] in 1467.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} Brunelleschi had planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today. Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by [[Michelangelo]].{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}}\n\nAt the conclusion of the [[Council of Florence]] on June 6, 1439, the ceremony of union between the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches took place beneath the dome of Florence Cathedral.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1989|p=251}} In the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence]], the smaller dome above the altar is decorated with astrological depictions of star [[constellation]]s that have been calculated to represent July 6, 1439 at about noon, the date of the closing session of the [[Council of Florence]], in which the [[Laetentur Caeli|Articles of Union between Eastern and Western Christendom]] were signed by Latin and Greek delegates.{{sfn|Brown|1981|pp=176-180}}\n\n==== Early renaissance ====\nBrunelleschi's domes at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]] established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] (1430\u201352) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. Twelve ribs between twelve circular windows converge on a small [[oculus]]. The circular dome rests on pendentives decorated with circular [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] of Florentine ceramic. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential. The dome of [[:it:Chiesa di San Sisto (Piacenza)|San Sisto in Piacenza]] (1499\u20131514) is circular and also includes pendentives with circular medallions.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175-177}} Another early example is [[Giuliano da Sangallo]]'s 1485 design of a dome on the church of [[Santa Maria delle Carceri]] in [[Prato]]. Like that of the Pazzi Chapel, the dome is ribbed.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=8}} The domed {{ill|Church of Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0 at Bibbona|it|Chiesa di Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0 (Bibbona)}} was built in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Monelli|2003|p=1472}}\n\nThe combination of [[dome]], [[Tholobate|drum]], [[pendentive]]s, and [[barrel vault]]s developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5}} Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome, then Venice.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=181}} The quincunx plan became popular in many parts of Italy from the end of the 15th century, often with a large dome on pendentives at the center of a square and four smaller domes at the corners.{{sfn|Giustina|Tomasoni|Giuriani|2006|p=1271}} From the late 15th century, semicircular arches became preferred in Milan, but round domes were less successful due to structural difficulties compared to those with pointed profiles.{{sfn|Giustina|2003|p=1038}} Domes in the renaissance style in Florence are mostly from the early period, in the fifteenth century. Cities within Florence's zone of influence, such as [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], and [[Turin]], mainly produced examples later, from the sixteenth century on.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=57-58}}\n\n''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and dedicated to [[Pope Nicholas V]] around 1452, recommends vaults with [[coffer]]ing for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is [[Bernardo Rossellino]]. Under Pope Nicholas V, construction started between 1451 and 1455 on an extension of the [[old St. Peter's Basilica]] to create a [[Crux immissa|Latin cross]] plan with a dome and lantern 100 braccia high over a crossing 44 braccia wide (about 24.5 meters wide). Little more than foundations and part of the choir walls were completed before work stopped with the death of Nicholas V. This innovation would culminate in [[Bramante]]'s 1505\u20136 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, and throughout the sixteenth century the Renaissance set of dome and barrel vault would displace use of Gothic ribbed vaults.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5-7}}\n\n[[Venetian Renaissance architecture]], perhaps delayed due to Venice's political independence, was blended with the existing [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian architectural tradition]] of Eastern influence. [[Pietro Lombardo]] designed the church of [[Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice|Santa Maria dei Miracoli]] (1481\u201389) with a dome over the sacristy. The masonry dome on a shallow drum and pendentives is covered by a taller outer wooden dome with a lantern.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=70-71}}\n\n==== Marche ====\nThe {{ill|Church of San Bernardino|it|Chiesa di San Bernardino (Urbino)}} was completed in [[Urbino]] before 1481 as a domed trilobe mausoleum.{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=43}}\n\nBegun in 1469, the [[Basilica della Santa Casa|Basilica of the Holy House]] at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] has an octagonal dome with a Gothic profile similar to that of Florence Cathedral. It was built by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] from 1499 to 1500, and its structure uses a [[herringbone pattern]] and contains two iron chains to resist outward thrust. The four towers at the corners of the crossing also contain octagonal cloister vaults at their intermediate level.{{sfn|Monelli|2003|p=1463, 1468, 1472}}\n\n==== Lombardy ====\n[[File:3074 - Milano - S. Maria delle Grazie - Fianco e tiburio - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 6-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in Milan.]]\nIn Lombardy, both octagonal and circular domes used ribs as late as the 1490s. Examples include the [[Portinari Chapel]] at the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], the church of [[Certosa di Pavia]] (1396\u20131473), the church of Sta. Maria Bressanoro at Castelleone, [[Milan Cathedral]], and the church of [[Santa Maria della Croce, Crema|Santa Maria della Croce]].{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=46}}{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175-177}} The Portinari Chapel, [[Cappella Colleoni|Colleoni Chapel]], and {{ill|Brivio Chapel|it|Cappella Brivio}} use a large square block to support a timburio. [[Donato Bramante]]'s dome of [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] was the first Lombard \"ribless hemispherical cupola with coffers\". The burial church of the House of Sforza, [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]], was begun in 1492 and by 1497 was completed to the upper gallery of the timburio. It is similar to the earlier Church of San Bernardino in Urbino in that it is also a domed trilobe mausoleum. However, the smooth, almost-hemispherical dome without ribs and the [[Hexadecagon|sixteen-sided]] timburio with two galleries and a pitched roof are clearly modeled on the earlier Church of San Lorenzo in Milan, the \"Milanese Pantheon\", and the interior arrangement is similar to that of the Portinari Chapel.{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=42-43, 46-47, 51}}\n\n=== The Low Countries of northwest Europe ===\n\nIn the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the [[Near East]] exposed the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the [[Orient]]. Although the first expressions of their European use are in the backgrounds of paintings, architectural uses followed. The Dome of the Rock and its bulbous dome being so prominent in Jerusalem, such domes apparently became associated by visitors with the city itself. In [[Bruges]], The [[:nl:Jeruzalemkerk (Brugge)|Church of the Holy Cross]], designed to symbolize the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]], was finished with a Gothic church tower capped by a bulbous cupola on a hexagonal shaft in 1428. Sometime between 1466 and 1500, a tower added to the [[Basilica of the Holy Blood|Chapel of the Precious Blood]] was covered by a bulbous cupola very similar to Syrian minarets. Likewise, in [[Ghent]], an octagonal staircase tower for the Church of St. Martin d'Ackerghem, built in the beginning of the sixteenth century, has a bulbous cupola like a minaret. These cupolas were made of wood covered with copper, as were the examples over turrets and towers in the [[Netherlands]] at the end of the fifteenth century, many of which have been lost. The earliest example from the Netherlands that has survived is the bulbous cupola built in 1511 over the town hall of [[Middelburg]]. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the following decades.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209-213}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of early and simple domes]]\n* [[History of early modern period domes]]\n* [[History of modern period domes]] \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Arce\n  | first = Ignacio\n  | year = 2006\n  | contribution = Umayyad Arches, Vaults & Domes: Merging and Re-creation.

The [[dome]]d church architecture of Italy from the sixth to the eighth centuries followed that of the Byzantine provinces and, although this influence diminishes under [[Charlemagne]], it continued on in [[Venice]], [[Southern Italy]], and [[Sicily]]. Charlemagne's [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] is a notable exception, being influenced by Byzantine models from [[Ravenna]] and [[Constantinople]]. The [[Dome of the Rock]], an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Muslim religious shrine built in [[Jerusalem]], was designed similarly to nearby Byzantine [[Martyrium (architecture)|martyria]] and Christian churches. Domes were also built as part of Muslim palaces, throne halls, pavilions, and baths, and blended elements of both Byzantine and [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]], using both [[pendentive]]s and [[squinch]]es. The origin of the [[Dome#Crossed-arch dome|crossed-arch dome type]] is debated, but the earliest known example is from the tenth century at the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]]. In [[Egypt]], a \"[[keel]]\" shaped dome profile was characteristic of [[Fatimid architecture]]. The use of squinches became widespread in the Islamic world by the tenth and eleventh centuries. [[Dome#Onion dome|Bulbous domes]] were used to cover large buildings in [[Syria]] after the eleventh century, following an architectural revival there, and the present shape of the Dome of the Rock's dome likely dates from this time.\n\nChristian domes in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church architecture, especially those of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], are generally octagonal on squinches and hidden externally within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] towers, beginning around 1050. An example is the church of [[San Michele Maggiore, Pavia|San Michele Maggiore]] in [[Pavia]], Italy. [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, with its five domes on pendentives modeled on the Byzantine [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], was built from 1063 to 1072. Domes on pendentives, apparently based upon Byzantine models, appear in the [[Aquitaine]] region of [[France]] after the beginning of the [[Crusades]] in 1095, such as the [[Fontevraud Abbey|abbey church of Fontevrault]], where [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was buried. A series of centrally planned churches were built by the [[Knights Templar]] throughout Europe, modeled on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], with the Dome of the Rock at their [[Temple Mount]] headquarters also an influence. Distinctive domes on pendentives were built in [[Spain]] during the [[Reconquista]]. Also built there were Christian crossed-arch domes similar to that of the earlier Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, such as at the [[:eu:Hilobi Santuaren eliza (Torres del R\u00edo)|Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Torres Del R\u00edo]]. [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. The octagonal dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] was a result of the expansion plans for that church from the 14th century, a part of efforts in [[Tuscany]] to build domes with exposed external profiles.\n\nThe [[muqarnas]] dome type may have originated in [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, but it was popular in [[Greater Maghreb|North Africa and Spain]] with more intricate cell patterns in [[stucco]] on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the [[Moors|Moorish]] palace of the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], Spain, are the 14th century [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters]]. In 14th century Egypt, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s and would construct hundreds of them over the next two and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by [[chamfer]]ed or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, [[ogee]], and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in [[spiral]]s, [[zigzag]]s, and [[Flower|floral]] designs. Bulbous [[minaret]]s from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous [[cupola]]s supporting smaller cupolas or [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] became popular in the sixteenth century.\n\n== Early Middle Ages ==\n=== Post-Roman areas ===\n{{further|Roman architecture|History of Roman and Byzantine domes}}\n[[File:Mausoleum of Theodoric (Ravenna)11.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]].]]\nSeventeen years after the last Western [[Roman Emperor]] was deposed, [[Theodoric the Great]] was the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic]] king of Italy. His building projects largely continued existing architectural conventions. His [[Arian Baptistry]] in [[Ravenna]] (c. 500), for example, closely echoes the [[Baptistry of Neon]] built before it.{{sfn|Barnish|2007|p=12}} Both baptistries are octagonal buildings with [[pyramid]]al roofs concealing interior domes.\n\nThe [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]], however, was understood by contemporaries to be remarkable.{{sfn|Barnish|2007|p=12}} Begun in 520, the {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} dome over the mausoleum was carved out of a single 440-ton slab of [[limestone]] and positioned some time between 522 and 526.{{sfn|Belcari|Marrucchi|2007|p=56}} The low saucer shape of the monolithic dome, which is estimated to be more than 230 tons of [[Istria]]n stone, may have been chosen to avoid radial cracking.{{sfn|Bardill|2008|p=341}} The twelve brackets carved as part of the dome's exterior are thought to have been used to maneuver the piece into place. The choice of large limestone blocks for the structure is significant as the most common construction material in the West at that time was brick. It is likely that foreign artisans were brought to Ravenna to build the structure; possibly from [[Syria]], where such stonework was used in contemporary buildings.{{sfn|Belcari|Marrucchi|2007|p=56}}\n\nThe Syria and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as \"conoid\", or similar to pine cones. When the [[Arab Muslims|Arab Muslim]] forces [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered the region]], they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th&nbsp;century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of [[Islam]]. The rapidity of this adoption was likely aided by the Arab religious traditions, which predate Islam, of both domed structures to cover the burial places of ancestors and the use of a round tabernacle tent with a dome-like top made of red leather for housing [[Cult image|idols]].{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=43}} Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the [[Umayyad]] period.

It is currently covered in gilded aluminum.{{sfn|Grabar|2006|p=1}}\n\nIn addition to religious shrines, domes were used over the audience and throne halls of Umayyad palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the [[caldarium|calderia]] of baths. Blending the architectural features of both the Byzantine and [[Sassanian architecture|Persian architecture]], the domes used both pendentives and [[squinch]]es and were made in a variety of shapes and materials.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} A dome stood at the center of the palace-city of Baghdad and, similarly but on a smaller scale, there are literary accounts of a domed audience hall in the palace of [[Abu Muslim Khorasani|Abu Muslim]] in [[Merv]] at the meeting point of four iwans arranged along the cardinal directions.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=196}}{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=19}}\n\nMuslim palaces included domical halls as early as the eighth century, well before domes became standard elements of mosque architecture. The early eighth century palace of [[Khirbat al-Minya]] included a domed gateway. The palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]] and a ninth century palace at [[Samarra]] included domed throne rooms. A domed structure covered a shallow pool in the main courtyard of the mid eighth century palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]]. Similar examples at mosques, such as the domed fountains at the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (destroyed in 987 and replaced with a different structure), at [[Great Mosque of Maarrat al-Numan|Maarrat al-Numan]], in [[Nishapur]], [[Tripoli]], and at the [[Umayyad Mosque|Mosque of Damascus]] seem to be related to this element of palace architecture, although they were later used as part of [[Wudu|ritual ablution]].{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=195-196}}\n\nThe calderia of early Islamic bath complexes at Amra, Sarraj, and [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] were roofed with stone or brick domes.{{sfn|Arce|2006|p=209}} The caldarium of the early Islamic bath at [[Qasr Amra]] contains \"the most completely preserved astronomical cupola decoration\", a decorative idea for bath domes that would long continue in the Islamic world.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=254}}\n\nThe placement of a dome in front of the [[mihrab]] of a mosque probably began with the rebuilding of the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in [[Medina]] by [[Al-Walid I|Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid]]. This was likely to emphasize the place of the ruler, although domes would eventually become focal points of decoration and architectural composition or indicate the direction of prayer. Later developments of this feature would include additional domes oriented axially to the mihrab dome.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194-195}} Byzantine workmen built the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] and its hemispherical dome for al Walid in 705.

Domed examples include the mosques at Sarmin (1305-6) and al-Bab (1305). The typical Damascus dome is smooth and supported by a double zone of squinches: four squinches create an eight sided transition that includes eight more squinches, and these create a sixteen-sided drum with windows in alternate sides.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=111-112}}\n\n=== Byzantine influence in Europe ===\n{{further|History of Roman and Byzantine domes}}\nItalian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans.

Later alterations to the mosque have changed its original form.{{sfn|Kuban|1985|p=1}} The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=340}}\n\nEgypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} Fatimid mausoleums, many of which have survived in [[Aswan]] and [[Cairo]], were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid \"keel\" shape profile.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p=165}} The first were built in and around [[Fustat]]. Those inside the city were decorated with carved stucco and contrast with the extreme simplicity of those outside the city, such as the four so-called Sab'a Banat (c. 1010) domed squares. Those at Aswan, mostly from the 11th century, are more developed, with ribbed domes, star-shaped openings, and octagonal drums with concave exterior sides which are corbeled outward at the top.

Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base.{{sfn|Fregonese|Taffurelli|2009}} These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until [[Fourth Crusade|after 1204]].{{sfn|Krautheimer|1986|p=407}} The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen from a great distance.{{sfn|Fregonese|Taffurelli|2009}} In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved weather protection.

This became increasingly popular as a Romanesque feature over the course of the next fifty years. The first [[Lombardy|Lombard]] church to have a [[lantern tower]], concealing an octagonal cloister vault, was [[San Nazaro in Brolo|San Nazaro]] in [[Milan]], just after 1075. Many other churches followed suit in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, such as the Basilica of [[San Michele Maggiore]] in [[Pavia]] (the coronation church of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy within the Holy Roman Empire]]) and the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. At Sant'Ambrogio, the original plan for the church did not include a domed crossing and it was modified to include one, as also happened at [[Pisa Cathedral#Duomo|Pisa Cathedral]] (funding for which was provided by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] in 1089 and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry V]] in 1116) and [[Speyer Cathedral]] (the burial church of the [[Salian dynasty]] of Holy Roman Emperors). The crossing domes at Pavia, Pisa, and Speyer were all completed around 1080 but the exact order of precedence is unresolved.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=201, 203, 207}}\n\nThe domes of Pisa Cathedral and Florence Baptistery may be the two earliest domes in [[Tuscany]] and were the two largest until about 1150.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=201-202}} Pisa Cathedral, built between 1063 and 1118, includes a high [[ellipse|elliptical]] dome at the crossing of its nave and transept. The marble dome was one of the first in [[Romanesque architecture]] and is considered the [[masterpiece]] of Romanesque domes. Rising 48&nbsp;meters above a rectangular bay, the shape of the dome was unique at the time.{{sfn|Fossi|2008|p=86}} The rectangular bay's dimensions are 18 meters by 13.5 meters. Squinches were used at the corners to create an elongated octagon in a system similar to that of the contemporary Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan and corbelling was used to create an oval base for the dome. The tambour on which the dome rests dates to between 1090 and 1100, and it is likely that the dome itself was built at that time. There is evidence that the builders did not originally plan for the dome and decided on the novel shape to accommodate the rectangular crossing bay, which would have made an octagonal cloister vault very difficult. Additionally, the dome may have originally been covered by an octagonal lantern tower that was removed in the 1300s, exposing the dome, to reduce weight on foundations not designed to support it. This would have been done no later than 1383, when the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] loggetta on the exterior of the dome was added, along with the buttressing arches on which it rests.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=197-200, 202, 206}}\n\n[[File:Baptist\u00e8re Saint-Jean (Florence) - 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Florence Baptistery]] in Italy.]]\n\nAn aspiring competitor to Pisa, the city of Florence took the opposite side in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|the conflict between Pope and Emperor]], siding with the [[Pope]] in Rome.

Its ratio of wall thickness to external diameter is about 1/10, in accordance with the rules of dome proportion followed until the 17th century. One of the most important religious buildings in Florence, the proportions of its dome were followed by the nearby dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore that was built by Brunelleschi centuries later. The polygonal dome was built with a wooden tension ring at about 23 meters high, too high to counteract the spreading forces, and a lower iron ring was added in 1514.{{sfn|Ottoni|Blasi|Betti|Bartoli|2016|pp=1802, 1806}}\n\n[[File:Speyer Dom BW 7.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Speyer Cathedral]] in Germany.]]\n\nThe renovation of Speyer Cathedral, the largest of the [[Imperial Cathedrals]] of the Holy Roman Empire, was begun around 1080 by the Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], soon after he had returned from a [[Walk to Canossa|trip to Canossa]] in northern Italy. Although the church had only just been consecrated in 1061, Henry called upon craftsmen from across the empire for its renovation. The redesign included two octagonal cloister vaults within crossing towers, one at the east crossing with an external dwarf gallery and one at the west end. This was very soon imitated elsewhere and became the model for later [[Rhineland|Rhenish]] octagonal domes, such as those of [[Worms Cathedral]] (c. 1120&ndash;1181) and [[Mainz Cathedral]] (c. 1081&ndash;1239).{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=140-141, 151, 156}} Many German Imperial cathedrals feature domes at their crossings.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}}\n\nChurches in northern Italy after 1100 were designed with vaulting from the outset, rather than as colonnaded basilicas with timber roofs and, like the Rhenish imperial cathedrals, many have octagonal domes with squinches over their crossings or choirs.

Much admired in the Renaissance, its dome collapsed in 1573 and was rebuilt with the present cloister vault.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=296-297}} Documentary evidence indicates that the Romanesque dome of San Lorenzo was a thin hemisphere of light material over a cube of space about 23.8 meters (40 Milanese braccia) on each side. The dome was supported by four corner squinches resting on the four [[Exedra|exedrae]] arches of the square space with a further eight smaller squinches between each of them to create a sixteen-sided base. It was covered on the exterior by a cylindrical or polygonal drum and timber roof. The exterior drum was likely polygonal, with eight or sixteen sides, and had two levels of [[Dwarf gallery|dwarf galleries]] beneath a cornice row of [[Lombard band|hanging arches]]. Evidence remains in the building's eastern corner towers of [[flying buttress]]es extending diagonally to the drum.

It served as a model for the later Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo.{{sfn|Saalman|1987|pp=376, 386-387}}\n\n==== Influence of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ====\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem seems to have had a wooden dome in two shells up to the 12th century, with some interruptions. After their establishing control of the city, the crusaders added a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] with a dome next to the existing rotunda.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=16-22}} The [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in France|French Romanesque]] addition replaced the eastern apse of the rotunda and a courtyard marking the [[Omphalos#Jerusalem|center of the world]] and was consecrated on July 15, 1149, the fiftieth anniversary of the capture of the city. The new dome's diameter of 10.4 meters was half that of the rotunda and it rested on four pointed arches on four pillars. It served as the coronation site for the crusader [[King of Jerusalem|kings of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Kenaan-Kedar|1986|p=110, 114}}\n\nThe rotunda itself was covered by a conical structure from the 12th to the early 19th century. [[Pisa Baptistry]] was built in 1153 with a truncated cone in clear imitation of the Holy Sepulchre; an outer dome shell was added in the 14th century. The domed baptisteries of Cremona (1176) and Parma (1196) also appear to have been influenced by the rotunda.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=5, 31-32}} The 12th century rotunda of the Holy Sepulchre at [[Santo Stefano, Bologna]], and the basilica at [[Neuvy-Saint-S\u00e9pulchre]] are imitations of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre although, like many of the imitations across Europe, they differ in their details, including their domes.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=5, 7}}\n\nThe [[Dome of the Rock]] and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the [[Temple Mount]] of Jerusalem were taken by the crusaders to represent the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]] and the [[Solomon#Building and other works|Palace of Solomon]], respectively. The [[Knights Templar]], headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence.{{sfn|Howard|1991|p=65, 67}} Examples include the church of the [[:es:Iglesia de la Vera Cruz (Segovia)|Vera Cruz at Segovia]], the church of the [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Convento do Cristo at Tomar]], a rotunda church in Paris destroyed during the French Revolution, and [[Temple Church]] in London. The [[Church of Saint Mary of Eunate]] was a pilgrims' burial church, rather than a Templar church, but may have been influenced by them.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=334, 335}}\n\n==== Aquitaine ====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre d'Angoul\u00eame durant le festival International de la Bande Dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame 2013 19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The nave of [[Angoul\u00eame Cathedral]].]]\n\nIn the [[Aquitaine]] region of southwest France, there are a large number of unusual domed Romanesque churches; over 250 in the [[P\u00e9rigord]] region alone. The area is far from ports with regular contact with the East and the source of influence is not entirely settled.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=18-20, 202}} A study in 1976 of Romanesque churches in [[Southern France|the south of France]] documented 130 with oval plan domes, such as the domes on pendentives at [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Martin de Saint-Martin-de-Gurson|Saint-Martin-de-Gurson, Dordogne]] and [[Balzac, Charente#Sites and monuments|Balzac, Charente]].{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=219}} The oval shape appears to have been a practical solution to rectangular crossing bays.{{sfn|Huerta|2007|p=244}} The use of pendentives to support domes in the Aquitaine region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Moffett|Fazio|Wodehouse|2003|p=}}\n\nBetween the [[Garonne]] and [[Loire]] rivers there are known to have been at least seventy-seven churches whose naves were covered by a line of domes. Half of them are in the P\u00e9rigord region. Most date to the twelfth century and sixty of them survive today.{{sfn|Stephenson|2010|p=390}} That the domes in this area were arranged in linear series has suggested the contemporary architecture of [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]] as the inspiration, which was located on a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] route to the [[Holy Land]].{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=284}} Cyprus had developed its own style of domed basilica during its [[Condominium (international law)|period of neutrality]] between Byzantine and Arab rulers, using three domes of roughly equal size in a line over the nave and very little lighting. There are indications of a connection between Aquitaine and Cyprus just after the First Crusade.{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=20, 178, 198}}\n\nThe earliest of these French churches may be [[Angoul\u00eame Cathedral]], built from 1105 to 1128. Its long nave is covered by four stone domes on pendentives, springing from pointed arches, the last of which covers the crossing and is surmounted by a stone lantern.{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}}{{sfn|Browne|2005|p=}} [[Cahors Cathedral]] (c. 1100\u20131119) covers its nave with two large domes in the same manner and influenced the later building at [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]].{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}} The [[abbey]] church at [[Fontevraud Abbey|Fontevrault]] served as a burial place for [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet royalty]], including [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], and is one of the most impressive examples. The earlier domed crossing is preceded by a wider nave covered by four domes, which was begun in 1125. The pendentives are original, but the four nave domes are modern replacements from about 1910.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=288}} The [[P\u00e9rigueux Cathedral|cathedral of S. Front at P\u00e9rigueux]] was built c. 1125\u20131150 and derives its five-domed cruciform plan ultimately from the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=106}} {{sfn|Ward|1915|p=117}}\n\n==== Spain ====\n[[File:Catedral Vieja - Salamanca.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dome over the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca|Cathedral of Salamanca]].]]\n[[File:Castillo de la Atalaya.

C\u00fapula almohade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Intersection of the dome arches inside the [[Atalaya Castle (Spain)]] of [[Villena]].]]\n\nThe remains of a crossing tower on the French [[Church of Saint-Jean de Montierneuf]] from about 1140 suggest an origin for some Spanish domes in a Romanesque and transitional Gothic style.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=323, 325, 328}} The architectural influences at work here have been much debated, with proposed origins ranging from Jerusalem, Islamic Spain, or the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] region in western France to a mixture of sources.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} During the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] in northern Spain built three churches famous for their domed crossing towers, called \"cimborios\", as it acquired new territories. The [[Cathedral of Zamora]], the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca|Cathedral of Salamanca]], and the [[Colegiata de Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor (Toro)|collegiate church of Toro]] were built around the middle of the 12th century. All three buildings have stone umbrella domes with sixteen ribs over windowed drums of either one or two stories, springing from pendentives. All three also have four small round towers engaged externally to the drums of the domes on their diagonal sides.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=410}} Perhaps the masterpiece of the series, the Salamanca crossing tower has two stories of windows in its drum. Its outer stone fish-scale roof lined with gothic [[crocket]]s is a separate corbelled layer with only eight lobes, which applies weight to the haunches of the sixteen-sided inner dome.{{sfn|Conant|1993|p=328}}\n\nAnother unusual Spanish example from the late 12th or early 13th century is the dome of the [[:eu:Hilobi Santuaren eliza (Torres del R\u00edo)|Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Torres Del R\u00edo]], on the [[Way of St. James]]. The Way, a major [[pilgrimage]] route through northern Spain to the reputed burial place of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Greater]], attracted pilgrims from throughout Europe, especially after pilgrimage to Jerusalem was cut off. The difficulty of travel to Jerusalem for pilgrimage prompted some new churches to be built as a form of substitute, evoking the central plan and dome of Jerusalem's [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] with their own variant. The dome in this case, however, is most evocative of the central mihrab dome of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]]. Over an octagonal room, the stone dome is formed by sixteen ribs, eight of which intersect with one another in a star pattern to define a smaller octagon at the center of the dome.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=173}} This is one of a number of Christian crossed-arch dome examples in Spain and the south of France from the end of the 12th century, with patterns based upon the square or octagon. Other examples include the domes of San Miguel de [[Almaz\u00e1n]], [[:fr:\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix d'Oloron|Santa Cruz de Olor\u00f3n]], and [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Blaise de L'H\u00f4pital-Saint-Blaise|San Blas Hospital]]. Contemporary Islamic examples in [[Almohad Caliphate|Spain and North Africa]] are distinguished from the Christian by the use of thinner and more numerous arches, such as those of the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], the [[Atalaya Castle (Spain)|Villena Castle in Alicante]], the [[Great Mosque of Taza]], and the minaret of [[Koutoubia Mosque]]. The style experienced a revival in early 16th century Spain when one of the crossed-arch domes of the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba was used as the model for domes at [[La Seo Cathedral|Zaragoza]], [[Teruel Cathedral|Teruel]], and [[Tarazona Cathedral|Tarazona]].{{sfn|Fuentes|Huerta|2010|p=347}}\n\n=== Sicily ===\n\nThe Christian domed basilicas built in Sicily after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman Conquest]] also incorporate distinctly Islamic architectural elements. They include hemispherical domes positioned directly in front of apses, similar to the common positioning in mosques of domes directly in front of mihrabs, and the domes use four squinches for support, as do the domes of Islamic [[Maghreb|North Africa]] and Egypt. In other cases, domes exhibit Byzantine influences with tall drums, engaged columns, and blind arcades.{{sfn|Nicklies|2004|p=107}} Examples at [[Palermo]] include the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]] (1132\u20131143), [[Martorana|La Martorana]] (c. 1140s), and [[Zisa, Palermo]] (12th century).{{sfn|Watkin|2005|p=105-106}}{{sfn|Swoboda|1961|p=88}} The church of [[San Giovanni degli Eremiti]] has five domes in a T-shaped arrangement and the [[Chiesa di San Cataldo|Church of San Cataldo]] has three domes on squinches, with both showing clearly Islamic influence.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=302}}\n\n=== North Africa, Syria, and Al-Jazira ===\n[[File:Kuppel Nur ad-Din Madrasa.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Nur al-Din Madrasa|mausoleum of Nur al-Din]] in Damascus.]]\n\nThe so-called shrine of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Imam al-Dawr]] in the village of [[Ad-Dawr|al-Dawr]], Iraq, is the earliest known example of a [[muqarnas]] dome, although it is unlikely to have been the first of its type. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by four squinches over a square bay. Three levels of muqarnas rise over this and are capped by a small cupola. The muqarnas cells are very large and resemble small squinches themselves. It was finished by 1090 by the court of an [[Uqaylid Dynasty|Uqaylid]] vassal of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] of Baghdad and, although there are no surviving examples from Baghdad at this time, the large number of muqarnas domes known to have existed there by the end of the Middle Ages suggests that it could have been the source of the type.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=62-63}}\n\nIn Islamic North Africa, there are several early muqarnas domes dating from the twelfth century. The earliest may be an [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] restoration between 1135 and 1140 of a series of stucco muqarnas domes over the axial nave of the mosque of the [[University of al-Karaouine|Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes|Fez]]. The existence of a near contemporary example from 1154 in the maristan of [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo|Nur al-din]] in Damascus, Syria, and the earlier example of a muqarnas dome in al-Dawr, Iraq, suggests that the style was imported from Baghdad.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=62-65}}\n\nMost of the examples of muqarnas domes are found in Iraq and [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazira]], dated from the middle of the twelfth century to the [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]]. The use of stucco to form the muqarnas pattern, suspended by a wooden framework from the exterior vault, was the least common in Iraq, although it would be very popular in North Africa and Spain. Because it used two shells, however, windows were restricted to the bases of the domes. They were otherwise used frequently in this type. In Iraq, the most common form was a single shell of brick, with the reverse of the interior pattern visible on the exterior. The Damascus [[Nur al-Din Madrasa|mausoleum of Nur al-Din]] (1172) and the shrine of Zumurrud Khatun in Baghdad are examples. A third type is found only in [[Mosul]] from the beginning of the thirteenth century. It has a brick pyramidal roof, usually covered in green glazed tiles. Of the five preserved examples, the finest is the shrine of Awn al-Din, which used tiny colored tiles to cover the muqarnas cells themselves and incorporates small muqarnas domes into the tiers of muqarnas supporting the large eight-sided star at the center. This design led to a further development at the shrine of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani|Shaykh Abd al-Samad]] in Natanz, Iran.{{sfn|Tabbaa|1985|p=65, 67}}\n\nThe architecture of Syria and [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazira]] includes the widest variety of forms in the medieval Islamic world, being influenced by the surviving architecture of [[Late Antiquity]], contemporary Christian buildings, and Islamic architecture from the east. There are some muqarnas domes of the Iraqi type, but most domes are slightly pointed hemispheres on either muqarnas pendentives or double zones of squinches and made of masonry, rather than brick and plaster. The domes cover single bay structures or are just a part of larger constructions. Syrian mausoleums consist of a square stone chamber with a single entrance and a mihrab and a brick lobed dome with two rows of squinches. The dome at the [[Silvan, Diyarbak\u0131r|Silvan]] Mosque, 13.5 meters wide and built from 1152-1157, has an unusual design similar to the dome added to the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan|Friday Mosque of Isfahan]] in 1086-1087: once surrounded by roofless aisles on three sides, it may have been meant to be an independent structure. The congregational mosque at [[K\u0131z\u0131ltepe]], with its well integrated dome of about 10 meters, is the masterpiece of [[Artuqids|Artuqid]] architecture.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=112, 115-116}}\n\nThe largest preserved [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] dome is that of the Matbakh al-'Ajami in [[Aleppo]], resting on muqarnas pendentives. It may have been the palace residence of the al-'Ajami family.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=115}} The mausoleum over the tomb of Iman [[Al-Shafi\u2018i]] (built in 1211) has a large wooden double dome (rebuilt in 1722) about 29 meters high and, with the tombs of [[As-Salih Ayyub|al-Malik al-Silah]] and the so-called Tomb of the Abassid Caliphs, is one of three important Ayyubid tombs in Cairo dating from the first half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=319}}{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=333-334}} The domed mausoleum was built 35 years after the [[Madrasa|madrassa]] ordered by [[Saladin]] at the site in 1176-7, which were introduced in Egypt after 1171 to counter [[Shia Islam]]. The only madrassa from the period to partly survive is the 1242 construction by [[As-Salih Ayyub]] on the site of the Fatimid Eastern Palace. The 10 meter wide domed tomb at its northern end led to the series of funerary madrassas built in Cairo by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultans]].{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=108}}\n\n=== Late Romanesque and early Gothic Europe ===\nThe use of domes declined in Western Europe with the rise of [[Gothic architecture]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of [[rib vault]]s over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} Spaces of circular or octagonal plan were sometimes covered with vaults of a \"double chevet\" style, similar to the [[Apse#Chevet|chevet apse]] vaulting in Gothic cathedrals. The crossing of [[:fr:\u00c9glise Saint-Nicolas de Blois|Saint Nicholas at Blois]] is an example.{{sfn|Ward|1915|p=117}} The domed \"Decagon\" nave of [[St. Gereon's Basilica]] in [[Cologne]], Germany, a ten-sided space in an oval shape, was built between 1219 and 1227 upon the remaining low walls of a 4th-century Roman mausoleum. The ribbed domical vault rises four stories and 34 meters above the floor, covering an oval area 23.5 meters long and 18.7 meters wide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=172-173}} It is unique among the [[Twelve romanesque churches of Cologne|twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne]], and in European architecture in general, and may have been the largest dome built in this period in Western Europe until the completion of the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]].{{sfn|Hayes|2009}}{{sfn|Schmitz|1985|p=49}}\n\n[[File:Duomo di siena, cupola, interno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The dome of [[Siena Cathedral]].]]\n\nIn Italy, the dome of [[Siena Cathedral]] had an exposed profile as early as 1224, and this feature was retained in its reconstruction around 1260.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=204}} The dome has two shells and was completed in 1264.

Similar to [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, its nave, transepts, crossing, and the intermediate bay before the choir are covered by domes on pendentives in the Byzantine style. Externally, the crossing dome is covered with a conical spire. The choir dome, which may be later than the others, is uniquely Gothic with ribs.{{sfn|Willis|1835|p=137-138}}\n\nIn England, a dome with a pyramidal roof and lantern at the Abbot's kitchen of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] dates to the early 14th century.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=39}} Similar vaulting was built over the kitchen of [[Newenham Abbey]] by 1338.{{sfn|Davidson|1843|p=151}} Timber star [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s such as those over [[York Minster]]'s octagonal [[Chapter house]] (ca. 1286\u20131296) and the elongated octagon plan of [[Wells Cathedral]]'s Lady Chapel (ca. 1320\u20131340) imitated much heavier stone vaulting.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}} The wooden vaulting over the crossing of [[Ely Cathedral]] was built after the original crossing tower collapsed in 1322.

The [[Alhambra#Hall of the Abencerrajes|Hall of the Abencerrajes]] (c. 1333\u201391) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333\u201354) are extraordinarily developed examples of [[muqarnas]] domes, taking the tradition of the squinch in Islamic architecture from a functional element in the zone of transition to a highly ornamental covering for the dome itself. The structural elements of these two domes are actually brick vaulting, but these are completely covered by the intricate [[moc\u00e1rabe]] stalactites. The lacy and star-shaped crossing dome of [[Burgos Cathedral]] (1567) may have been inspired by these examples, in addition to that built over the cathedral's octagonal Chapel of the Condestable (1482&ndash;94) in the Gothic style.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=174}}\n\nIn the [[mud\u00e9jar]] style of Seville after [[Siege of Seville|the Christian reconquest of the city]], a kind of dome made of intricately interlaced pieces of painted and gilded wood was known as a ''media naranja'', or \"half orange\". The most famous example covers the \"[[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville#Salon de Embajadores|Hall of the Ambassadors]]\" throne room in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Royal Palace Complex of Seville]], a 10 meter wide space built in 1427.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=210}}\n\n=== Mamluk Sultanate ===\n[[File:Dome of Qaytbay complex.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The dome of [[Qaitbay|Qaytbay]] in Cairo's northern cemetery.]]\n\nIn the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]], with the brick domes being only 20 percent of those constructed around 1322. Over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk [[sultan]]s and [[emir]]s. Although they kept roughly the same proportions, the shift from brick to stone is also associated with an increase in the average span and height of about 3 to 4 meters, and a decrease in the thickness of the domes. The stone domes are generally 8 to 10 meters in diameter and 7 to 11 meters high. The Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq (1398\u20131411) is an exceptional case, with a dome 16 meters wide and 12.8 meters tall.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=696, 698}}\n\nThe stone domes are generally single shells except at the conical crown, where there is a gap between inner and outer layers filled with earth and rubble and which contains the bases of the metal spires. Double shelled domes are rare, but an example is that of Al-Sultanyya Madrasa from 1360. The domes were constructed in circular rings, with the sizes decreasing towards the top of the dome and, because of this, it is possible that elaborate centering may not have been needed. Collapsed remains of some domes has revealed a layer of brick beneath the external stone, which could have supported and aligned the heavier stone during construction. Although the earliest stone domes do not have them, horizontal connections between the ashlar stone blocks were introduced in the fourteenth century, such as those made of [[teak]] wood in a dovetail shape used in the Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=698, 709, 712-713}} Dome profiles were varied, with \"keel-shaped\", bulbous, [[ogee]], stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were [[chamfer]]ed, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318}}\n\nDecoration for these first stone domes was initially the same external ribbing as earlier brick domes, and such brick domes would continue to be built throughout the Mamluk period, but more elaborate patterns of carving were introduced through the beginning of the sixteenth century. Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time would make this unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and [[zigzag]] patterns were common both by the end of the fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there.{{sfn|Cipriani|Lau|2006|p=699-700, 714}}\n\nThe twin-domes of the Sultaniyya complex (c. 1360) and the narrow dome of Yunus al-Dawadar (c. 1385) are unusual in that they have [[muqarnas]] at the base of their external ribs, a feature of ribbed domes in Persia. The first example of the zigzag pattern is on the dome of Mahmud al-Kurdi (1394\u201395), and at least fourteen subsequent domes also used it. The first example of a dome in Cairo with a star pattern is the mausoleum of [[Barsbay|al-Ashraf Barsbay]]. The dome of [[Qaitbay|Qaytbay]] in Cairo's northern cemetery combines geometric and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] patterns and is one of the finest.{{sfn|O'Kane|2012|p=4, 8, 9, 11, 15}} Internally, the squinches of the zone of transition developed into miniaturized and pointed versions that were used row upon row over the entire expanded zone and bordered above and below by plain surfaces.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1994|p=318-319}} Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n==== Tuscany ====\n[[File:Pisa Campo Miracoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The domes of [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Baptistery|Pisa Baptistery]] and [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Cathedral|Cathedral]].]]\n\nExposed domes were common in [[Tuscany]] and a source of regional distinctiveness by the 1380s.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} The exposed outer dome of [[Pisa Baptistry|Pisa Baptistery]] was built over its earlier inner conical roof in the 14th century.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1942|p=32}} If an external lantern tower was also removed from [[Piazza dei Miracoli#Cathedral|Pisa Cathedral]] in the 1300s, exposing the dome, one reason may have been to stay current with more recent projects in the region, such as the domed cathedrals of Siena and Florence. {{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} Rapid progress on a radical expansion of Siena Cathedral, which would have involved replacing the existing dome with a larger one, was halted not long after the city was struck with an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in 1348.{{sfn|Norman|1995|p=137}} Its dome was originally topped with a copper orb, similar to that over Pisa's dome today, but this was replaced in 1385 by a cupola surmounted by a smaller [[Globus cruciger|sphere and cross]].{{sfn|Carli|2003|p=25}} \n\nIt was only a few years after the city of Siena had decided to abandon the massive expansion and redesign of their cathedral in 1355 that Florence decided to greatly expand theirs.{{sfn|Norman|1995|p=136}} A plan for the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] was settled by 1357.{{sfn|Smith|1984|p=206}} However, in 1367 it was proposed to alter the church plan at the east end to increase the scale of the octagonal dome, widening it from 62 to 72 braccia, with the intent to further surpass the domes of Pisa and Siena, and this modified plan was ratified in 1368, under Master of Works [[Francesco Talenti]].{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}}{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} The construction guilds of Florence had sworn to adhere to the model of the dome created in 1367, with a \"quinto acuto\" pointed profile, but the scale of this new dome was so ambitious that experts for the ''Opera del Duomo'', the board supervising the construction, expressed the opinion as early as 1394 that the dome could not be accomplished.{{sfn|Salvadori|Hooker|Ragus|1990|p=233-234}} Discussion in the fourteenth century revolved primarily around the cost of the project, and secondarily about the style.{{sfn|Cowan|1977|p=8}} The enlarged dome would span the entire {{convert|42|m|adj=on}} width of the three aisled nave, just 2 meters less than that of the Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the largest dome in the world.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} And because the distances between the angles of the octagon were even farther apart at {{convert|45.5|m}}, the average span of the dome would be marginally wider than that of the Pantheon.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=123}} At 144 braccia, the height of the dome would evoke the holy number of the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly Jerusalem]] mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. By 1413, with the exception of one of the three apses, the east end of the church had been completed up to the windowed octagonal drum but the problem of building the huge dome did not yet have a solution.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} In 1417, with the drum completed, the master builder in charge of the project retired and a competition for plans to build the dome was begun in August 1418.{{sfn|Gentry|Lesniewski|2011|p=}}{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} \n\n[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|right|The Cathedral of [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence.]]\n[[Florence Cathedral#Dome|Brunelleschi's dome]], designed in 1418, follows the height and form mandated in 1367.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}}{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1420. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}} The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=355}} A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome.{{sfn|Gentry|Lesniewski|2011|p=}} \n\nAlthough generally preferred in Italy at the time, no visible internal ties were used.{{sfn|Mainstone|1969|p=107}} Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{sfn|Como|2013|p=190}} The design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, but it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built.{{sfn|Chant|Goodman|1999|p=166, 169}} The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.{{sfn|Frankl|Crossley|2000|p=213}} The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}} It was completed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolommeo]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] in 1467.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=528}} Brunelleschi had planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today. Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by [[Michelangelo]].{{sfn|Sch\u00fctz|2002|p=356-357}}\n\nAt the conclusion of the [[Council of Florence]] on June 6, 1439, the ceremony of union between the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches took place beneath the dome of Florence Cathedral.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1989|p=251}} In the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence]], the smaller dome above the altar is decorated with astrological depictions of star [[constellation]]s that have been calculated to represent July 6, 1439 at about noon, the date of the closing session of the [[Council of Florence]], in which the [[Laetentur Caeli|Articles of Union between Eastern and Western Christendom]] were signed by Latin and Greek delegates.{{sfn|Brown|1981|pp=176-180}}\n\n==== Early renaissance ====\nBrunelleschi's domes at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]] established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=304}} His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] (1430\u201352) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. Twelve ribs between twelve circular windows converge on a small [[oculus]]. The circular dome rests on pendentives decorated with circular [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] of Florentine ceramic. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential. The dome of [[:it:Chiesa di San Sisto (Piacenza)|San Sisto in Piacenza]] (1499\u20131514) is circular and also includes pendentives with circular medallions.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175-177}} Another early example is [[Giuliano da Sangallo]]'s 1485 design of a dome on the church of [[Santa Maria delle Carceri]] in [[Prato]]. Like that of the Pazzi Chapel, the dome is ribbed.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=8}} The domed {{ill|Church of Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0 at Bibbona|it|Chiesa di Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0 (Bibbona)}} was built in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Monelli|2003|p=1472}}\n\nThe combination of [[dome]], [[Tholobate|drum]], [[pendentive]]s, and [[barrel vault]]s developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5}} Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome, then Venice.{{sfn|Nuttgens|1997|p=181}} The quincunx plan became popular in many parts of Italy from the end of the 15th century, often with a large dome on pendentives at the center of a square and four smaller domes at the corners.{{sfn|Giustina|Tomasoni|Giuriani|2006|p=1271}} From the late 15th century, semicircular arches became preferred in Milan, but round domes were less successful due to structural difficulties compared to those with pointed profiles.{{sfn|Giustina|2003|p=1038}} Domes in the renaissance style in Florence are mostly from the early period, in the fifteenth century. Cities within Florence's zone of influence, such as [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], and [[Turin]], mainly produced examples later, from the sixteenth century on.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=57-58}}\n\n''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and dedicated to [[Pope Nicholas V]] around 1452, recommends vaults with [[coffer]]ing for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is [[Bernardo Rossellino]]. Under Pope Nicholas V, construction started between 1451 and 1455 on an extension of the [[old St. Peter's Basilica]] to create a [[Crux immissa|Latin cross]] plan with a dome and lantern 100 braccia high over a crossing 44 braccia wide (about 24.5 meters wide). Little more than foundations and part of the choir walls were completed before work stopped with the death of Nicholas V. This innovation would culminate in [[Bramante]]'s 1505\u20136 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, and throughout the sixteenth century the Renaissance set of dome and barrel vault would displace use of Gothic ribbed vaults.{{sfn|Betts|1993|p=5-7}}\n\n[[Venetian Renaissance architecture]], perhaps delayed due to Venice's political independence, was blended with the existing [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian architectural tradition]] of Eastern influence. [[Pietro Lombardo]] designed the church of [[Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice|Santa Maria dei Miracoli]] (1481\u201389) with a dome over the sacristy. The masonry dome on a shallow drum and pendentives is covered by a taller outer wooden dome with a lantern.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=70-71}}\n\n==== Marche ====\nThe {{ill|Church of San Bernardino|it|Chiesa di San Bernardino (Urbino)}} was completed in [[Urbino]] before 1481 as a domed trilobe mausoleum.{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=43}}\n\nBegun in 1469, the [[Basilica della Santa Casa|Basilica of the Holy House]] at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] has an octagonal dome with a Gothic profile similar to that of Florence Cathedral. It was built by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] from 1499 to 1500, and its structure uses a [[herringbone pattern]] and contains two iron chains to resist outward thrust. The four towers at the corners of the crossing also contain octagonal cloister vaults at their intermediate level.{{sfn|Monelli|2003|p=1463, 1468, 1472}}\n\n==== Lombardy ====\n[[File:3074 - Milano - S. Maria delle Grazie - Fianco e tiburio - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 6-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in Milan.]]\nIn Lombardy, both octagonal and circular domes used ribs as late as the 1490s. Examples include the [[Portinari Chapel]] at the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], the church of [[Certosa di Pavia]] (1396\u20131473), the church of Sta. Maria Bressanoro at Castelleone, [[Milan Cathedral]], and the church of [[Santa Maria della Croce, Crema|Santa Maria della Croce]].{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=46}}{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=175-177}} The Portinari Chapel, [[Cappella Colleoni|Colleoni Chapel]], and {{ill|Brivio Chapel|it|Cappella Brivio}} use a large square block to support a timburio. [[Donato Bramante]]'s dome of [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] was the first Lombard \"ribless hemispherical cupola with coffers\". The burial church of the House of Sforza, [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]], was begun in 1492 and by 1497 was completed to the upper gallery of the timburio. It is similar to the earlier Church of San Bernardino in Urbino in that it is also a domed trilobe mausoleum. However, the smooth, almost-hemispherical dome without ribs and the [[Hexadecagon|sixteen-sided]] timburio with two galleries and a pitched roof are clearly modeled on the earlier Church of San Lorenzo in Milan, the \"Milanese Pantheon\", and the interior arrangement is similar to that of the Portinari Chapel.{{sfn|Schofield|1986|pp=42-43, 46-47, 51}}\n\n=== The Low Countries of northwest Europe ===\n\nIn the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the [[Near East]] exposed the [[Low Countries]] of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the [[Orient]]. Although the first expressions of their European use are in the backgrounds of paintings, architectural uses followed. The Dome of the Rock and its bulbous dome being so prominent in Jerusalem, such domes apparently became associated by visitors with the city itself. In [[Bruges]], The [[:nl:Jeruzalemkerk (Brugge)|Church of the Holy Cross]], designed to symbolize the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]], was finished with a Gothic church tower capped by a bulbous cupola on a hexagonal shaft in 1428. Sometime between 1466 and 1500, a tower added to the [[Basilica of the Holy Blood|Chapel of the Precious Blood]] was covered by a bulbous cupola very similar to Syrian minarets. Likewise, in [[Ghent]], an octagonal staircase tower for the Church of St. Martin d'Ackerghem, built in the beginning of the sixteenth century, has a bulbous cupola like a minaret. These cupolas were made of wood covered with copper, as were the examples over turrets and towers in the [[Netherlands]] at the end of the fifteenth century, many of which have been lost. The earliest example from the Netherlands that has survived is the bulbous cupola built in 1511 over the town hall of [[Middelburg]]. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the following decades.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=209-213}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of early and simple domes]]\n* [[History of early modern period domes]]\n* [[History of modern period domes]] \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Arce\n  | first = Ignacio\n  | year = 2006\n  | contribution = Umayyad Arches, Vaults & Domes: Merging and Re-creation.

As workers moved away from farm work to factories, mines and other hard labor, they faced harsh working conditions such as long hours, low pay and health risks. Children and women worked in factories and generally received lower pay than men.{{Citation needed|reason=Hard data figured would be good to know.|date=November 2019}} The government did little to limit these conditions.  Labor movements in the  industrialized world developed that lobbied for better rights and safer conditions.   Shaped by wars, depressions, government policies, judicial rulings, and global competition, the early years of the battleground between unions and management were adversarial and often identified with aggressive hostility.   Contemporary [[opposition to trade unions]] known as [[union busting]] started in the 1940s and continues to present challenges to the labor movement. Union busting is a term used by [[Labor union|labor]] organizations and [[trade unions]] to describe the activities that may be undertaken by  employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], [[card check]], [[organizing (management)|worker organizing]], and [[strike actions]].<ref>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5604656</ref>  Labor legislation has changed the nature of union busting, as well as the organizing tactics that labor organizations commonly use.\n\n== Strike breaking and union busting, 1870s\u20131935 ==\nHiring agencies specialising in anti-union practices has been an option available to employers from the bloody strikes of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, until today.<ref name=\"Smith xiv\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xiv.</ref>\n\nWorking with owner [[John D.

Around this time, the [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]s' union opposed Pratt's efforts to cut back on certain manual operations, as they were the craftsmen who made the barrels that held the oil.

In 1907, [[Morris Friedman]] reported that a Pinkerton agent who had infiltrated the [[Western Federation of Miners]] managed to gain control of a strike relief fund, and [[James McParland#McParland in Colorado|attempted to exhaust that union's treasury]] by awarding lavish benefits to strikers.<ref name=\"Haywood\">''The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood'', William D. Haywood, 1929, pages 157-58.</ref> However, many attacks against unions have used force of one sort or another, including police action, military force, or recruiting [[goon squad]]s.\n\n===Physical attacks against unions===\nUnions such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) were devastated by the [[Palmer Raids]], carried out as part of the [[First Red Scare]]. The [[Everett Massacre]] (also known as Bloody Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities and IWW members which took place in [[Everett, Washington]] on Sunday, November 5, 1916. Later, [[communist]]-led unions were isolated or destroyed and their activists purged with the assistance of other union organizations during the [[Second Red Scare]].\n\n[[File:Haymarketstation.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's depiction of the Haymarket Square riot]]\nIn May 1886 the Knights of Labor were demonstrating in the [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Square]] in Chicago, demanding an [[eight-hour day]] in all trades. When police arrived, an unknown person threw a bomb into the crowd, killing one person and injuring several others. \"In a trial marked by prejudice and hysteria\" a court sentenced seven [[anarchists]], six of them German-speaking, to death - with no evidence linking them to the bomb.<ref>Tindall and Shi, 1984, p. 829.</ref>\n\nStrikes also took place that same month (May 1886) in other cities, including in Milwaukee, where seven people died when Wisconsin Governor [[Jeremiah McLain Rusk|Jeremiah M. Rusk]] ordered [[state militia|state-militia]] troops to fire upon thousands of striking workers who had marched to the Milwaukee Iron Works Rolling Mill in Bay View, on Milwaukee's south side.\n\nIn 1914 one of the most bitter labor conflicts in American history took place at a mining colony in Colorado called [[Ludlow massacre|Ludlow]]. After workers went on strike in September 1913 with grievances ranging from requests for an eight-hour day to allegations of subjugation, Colorado governor [[Elias Ammons]] called in the [[Colorado National Guard|National Guard]] in October 1913. That winter, Guardsmen made 172 arrests.{{efn|As the conflict dragged on, the state of Colorado was unable to pay the salaries of many National Guardsmen. As enlisted men dropped out, mine guards took their places, their uniforms, and their weapons.}}<ref name=\"kick263\">Kick et al., 2002, p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe strikers began to fight back, killing four mine guards and firing into a separate camp where strikebreakers lived. When the body of a strikebreaker was found nearby, the National Guard's General [[John Chase (doctor and soldier)|Chase]] ordered the tent colony destroyed in retaliation.<ref name=\"kick263\" />\n\n\"On Monday morning, April 20, two dynamite bombs were exploded, in the hills above Ludlow [...] a signal for operations to begin. At 9&nbsp;am a machine gun began firing into the tents [where strikers were living], and then others joined.\"<ref name=\"kick263\" /> One eyewitness reported: \"The soldiers and mine guards tried to kill everybody; anything they saw move\".<ref name=\"kick263\" /> That night the National Guard rode down from the hills surrounding Ludlow and set fire to the tents. Twenty-six people, including two women and eleven children, were killed.<ref>\nKick et al., 2002, p. 264.\n</ref>\n\n===Union busting with police and military force===\nFor approximately 150 years, union organizing efforts and strikes have been periodically opposed by police, security forces, [[United States National Guard|National Guard units]], special police forces such as the [[Coal and Iron Police]], and/or use of the [[United States Army]]. Significant incidents have included the [[Haymarket Riot]] and the [[Ludlow massacre]]. The [[Homestead strike|Homestead]] struggle of 1892, the [[Pullman strike|Pullman]] walkout of 1894, and the [[Colorado Labor Wars]] of 1903 are examples of unions destroyed or significantly damaged by the deployment of military force. In all three examples, a strike became the triggering event.\n\n*'''Pinkertons and militia at Homestead, 1892''' - One of the first union busting agencies was the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], which came to public attention as the result of a shooting war that broke out between strikers and three hundred Pinkerton agents during the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892. When the Pinkerton agents were withdrawn, state militia forces were deployed. The militia repulsed attacks on the steel plant, and prevented violence against strikebreakers crossing picket lines, causing a decisive defeat of the strike, and ended the power of the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] at the Homestead plant.\n*'''Federal troops end the railroad blockades by the American Railway Union, 1894''' - During the [[Pullman Strike]], the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), out of union solidarity, called out its members according to the principle of [[industrial unionism]]. Their actions in blocking the movement of railroad trains were illegal but successful, until twenty thousand federal troops were called out to ensure that trains carrying US mail could travel freely. Once the trains ran, the strike ended.\n*'''National Guard in the Colorado Labor Wars, 1903''' - The [[Colorado National Guard]], an employers' organization called the [[Citizens' Alliance]], and the [[Mine Owners' Association]] teamed together to eject the [[Western Federation of Miners]] from mining camps throughout Colorado during the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].\n\n===Anatomy of a corporate union buster===\n{{main|Corporations Auxiliary Company}}\n\n[[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], a union buster during the first half of the 20th century, would tell employers,\n\n<blockquote>Our man will come to your factory and get acquainted... If he finds little disposition to organize, he will not encourage organization, but will engineer things so as to keep organization out. If, however, there seems a disposition to organize he will become the leading spirit and pick out just the right men to join. Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.<ref>Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nIn the period 1933 to 1936, Corporations Auxiliary Company had 499 corporate clients.<ref>John J. Abt, Michael Myerson, Advocate and activist: memoirs of an American communist lawyer, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 63</ref>\n\n===College students as strikebreakers in the Interborough Rapid Transit strike of 1905===\nFollowing a [[walk out]] of subway workers, management of the trains  [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|Interborough Rapid Transit]] in New York City appealed to university students to volunteer as motormen, conductors, ticket sellers and ticket choppers. Stephen Norword discusses the phenomenon of students as strikebreakers in early 20th Century North America: \"Throughout the period between 1901 and 1923, college students represented a major, and often critically important source of strikebreakers in a wide range of industries and services. (\u2026) Collegians deliberately volunteered their services as strikebreakers and were the group least likely to be swayed by the pleas of strikers and their sympathizers that they were doing something wrong.\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Norwood\n | first = Stephen H.\n | authorlink = Stephen H.

Strikebreaking by recruiting massive numbers of replacement workers became a significant activity.\n\nJack Whitehead saw opportunity in labor struggles; while other workers were attempting to organize unions, he walked away from his union to organize an army of strikebreakers. Whitehead was the first to be called \"King of the Strike Breakers\"; by deploying his private workforce during strikes of steelworkers in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama]], he became wealthy. By demonstrating how lucrative strikebreaking could be, Whitehead inspired a host of imitators.<ref name=\"Smith 40\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 40.</ref>\n\n===James Farley inherits the strikebreaker title===\nAfter Whitehead, men like James A. Farley and [[Pearl Bergoff]] turned union busting into a substantial industry. Farley began his strikebreaking career in 1895, and opened a detective agency in [[New York City]] in 1902. In addition to detective work, Farley accepted industrial assignments, specializing in breaking strikes of streetcar drivers.<ref name=\"Smith 41\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 41.</ref> Farley hired his men based in part upon courage and toughness, and in some strikes they openly carried firearms. They were paid more than the strikers had been. Farley was credited with a string of successful strikebreaking actions, employing hundreds, and sometimes thousands of strikebreakers. Farley was sometimes paid as much as three hundred thousand dollars for breaking a strike, and by 1914 he had taken in more than ten million dollars. Farley claimed that he had defeated thirty-five strikes in a row. But he suffered from tuberculosis, and as he faced death, he declared that he turned down the job of breaking a streetcar strike in Philadelphia because this time, \"the strikers were in the right.\"<ref name=\"Smith 41-42, 45, 47-48, 53-54\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 41-42, 45, 47-48, and 53-54.</ref>\n\n===Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters===\n[[Pearl Bergoff]] also began his strikebreaking career in New York City, working as a [[Labor spies|spotter]] on the [[New York Railways|Metropolitan Street Railway]] in Manhattan. His job was to watch conductors, making certain that they recorded all of the fares that they accepted. In 1905 Bergoff started the Vigilant Detective Agency of [[New York City]]. Within two years his brothers joined the lucrative business, and the name was changed to the Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters. Bergoff's early strikebreaking actions were characterized by extreme violence. A 1907 strike of garbage cart drivers resulted in numerous confrontations between strikers and the strikebreakers, even when protected by police escorts. Strikers sometimes pelted the strikebreakers with rocks, bottles, and bricks launched from tenement rooftops.<ref name=\"Smith 55-56\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 55-56.</ref>\n\n[[File:Afl inconsequential american employer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Anti-union cartoon in monthly magazine ''The American Employer'' depicting the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] as a fly on the wheel, 1913]]In 1909, [[Pressed Steel Car Company|the Pressed Steel Car Company]] at [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]] fired forty men, and eight thousand employees walked out under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. Bergoff's agency hired strikebreaking toughs from the Bowery, and shipped vessels filled with unsuspecting immigrant workers directly into the strike zone. Other immigrant strikebreakers were delivered in boxcars, and were not fed during a two-day period. Later they worked, ate, and slept in a barn with two thousand other men. Their meals consisted of cabbage and bread.<ref name=\"Smith 58-59\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 58-59.</ref>\n\nThere were violent confrontations between strikers and strikebreakers, but also between strikebreakers and guards when the terrified workers demanded the right to leave. An Austro-Hungarian immigrant who managed to escape told his government that workers were being held against their will, resulting in an international incident. In addition to kidnapping, strikebreakers complained of deception, broken promises about wages, and tainted food.<ref name=\"Smith 59-60\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 59-60.</ref>\n\nDuring federal hearings, Bergoff explained that \"musclemen\" under his employ would \"get... any graft that goes on\", suggesting that was to be expected \"on every big job.\"<ref name=\"Smith 59-60\" /> Other testimony indicated that Bergoff's \"right-hand man\", described as \"huge in stature, weighing perhaps 240 pounds\", surrounded himself with thirty-five guards who intimidated and fleeced the strikebreakers, locking them into a boxcar prison with no sanitation facilities when they defied orders.<ref name=\"Smith 61\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 61.</ref>\n\nAt the end of August a gun battle erupted, leaving six dead, six dying, and fifty wounded. Public sympathy began to swing away from the company, and toward the strikers. Early in September the company acknowledged defeat and negotiated with the strikers. Twenty-two had died in the strike. But Bergoff's business wasn't hurt by the defeat; he boasted of having as many as ten thousand strikebreakers on his payroll.<ref name=\"Smith 61\" /> He was getting paid as much as two million dollars per strikebreaking job.<ref name=\"Smith 67\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 67.</ref>\n\n===Anti-union vigilantes during the First Red Scare===\nUnlike the [[American Federation of Labor]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] opposed the First World War. The [[American Protective League]] (APL) was a pro-war organization formed by wealthy Chicago businessmen. At the height of its power the APL had 250,000 members in 600 cities. In 1918, documents from the APL showed that ten percent of its efforts (the largest of any category) were focused on disrupting the activities of the IWW. The APL burgled and vandalized IWW offices, and harassed IWW members. Such actions were illegal, yet were supported by the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration.<ref name=\"APL\">Information from [[American Protective League]] Retrieved March 28, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Spies, \"missionaries,\" and saboteurs===\n[[File:Afl too powerful american employer.jpg|thumb|160px|Anti-union cartoon in monthly magazine ''The American Employer'' depicting the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] as a cannon aimed at a government building, 1914]]Strikebreaking by hiring massive numbers of tough opportunists began to lose favor in the 1920s; there were fewer strikes, resulting in fewer opportunities.<ref name=\"Smith 61\" /><ref name=\"Smith 68\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 68.</ref> By the 1930s, agencies began to rely more upon the use of [[Labor spies|informants and labor spies]].\n\nSpy agencies hired to bust unions developed a level of sophistication that could devastate targets. \"Missionaries\" were undercover operatives trained to use whispering campaigns or unfounded rumors to create dissension on the picket lines and in union halls. The strikers themselves were not the only targets. For example, female missionaries might systematically visit the strikers' wives in the home, relating a sob story of how a strike had destroyed their own families. Missionary campaigns have been known to destroy not only strikes, but unions themselves.<ref name=\"Smith 88-89\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 88-89.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the Pinkerton Agency employed twelve hundred labor spies, and nearly one-third of them held high level positions in the targeted unions. The [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers|International Association of Machinists]] was damaged when Sam Brady, a veteran Pinkerton operative, held a high enough position in that union that he was able to precipitate a premature strike. All but five officers in a [[United Auto Workers]] local in [[Lansing, Michigan]] were driven out by Pinkerton agents. The five who remained were Pinkertons. At the Underwood Elliott-Fisher Company plant, the union local was so badly injured by undercover operatives that membership dropped from more than twenty five hundred to fewer than seventy-five.<ref name=\"Smith 88\">From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 88.</ref>\n\n===General strikebreaking methods===\n\nDuring the period from roughly 1910 to 1914, [[Robert Hoxie]] compiled a list of methods used by employers' associations to attack unions. The list was published in 1921, as part of the book ''Trade Unionism in the United States''.  These methods include counter organization, inducing union leaders to support management, supporting other pro-business enterprises, refusing to work with pro-union enterprises, obtaining information on unions among others.<ref>[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-200.</ref>\n\nHoxie summarized the underlying theories, assumptions, and attitudes of employers' associations of the period. According to Hoxie, these included the supposition that employers' interests are always identical to society's interests, such that unions should be condemned when they interfere; that the employers' interests are always harmonious with the workers' interests, and unions therefore try to mislead workers; that workers should be grateful to employers, and are therefore ungrateful and immoral when they join unions; that the business is solely the employer's to manage; that unions are operated by non-employees, and they are therefore necessarily outsiders; that unions restrict the right of employees to work when, where, and how they wish; and that the law, the courts, and the police represent absolute and impartial rights and justice, and therefore unions are to be condemned when they violate the law or oppose the police.<ref>[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-96.</ref>\n\nGiven the proliferation of employers' associations created primarily for the purpose of opposing unions, Hoxie poses counter-questions. For example, if every employer has a right to manage his own business without interference from outside workers, then why hasn't a group of workers at a particular company the right to manage their own affairs without interference from outside employers?<ref>Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 198.</ref>\n\n==Strikebreaking and union busting, 1936\u20131947==\nEmployers in the United States have had the legal right to permanently replace economic strikers since the Supreme Court's 1937 decision in ''[[NLRB v.

(LRA) founded in 1939 by Nathan Shefferman, who later in 1961 wrote The Man in the Middle, [[Union busting#The first guide to modern union busting|a guide to union busting]], and has been considered the 'founding father' of the modern union avoidance industry.<ref name=\"Logan 651-675\" /> Shefferman had been a member of the original NLRB, and became director of employee relations at Chicago-based [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]. Sears had been engaged in blocking unions from the AFL Retail Clerks union  throughout the 1930s.  Sears provided $10,000 seed money to launch LRA.<ref name=\"Levitt 33-34\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 33-34.</ref>   In 1957 during hearings conducted by the United States, Congress, and Select Committees on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field.<ref>https://archive.org/details/investigationofi16unit</ref>  Nate Shefferman was questioned by Robert Kennedy and testimony revealed that Teamsters union \"top brass\" were regularly sent to meet with him.

An indicator of the close relationship between the Teamster's President David Beck and Shefferman (excerpted from the article):  \"Beck dispatched Shefferman to Jim Hoffa last year (1956) to offer Hoffa the union's presidency if Hoffa would first help re-elect Beck and then wait 6 months for Beck to resign on grounds of ill health\".  The article asks \"Why did Beck and the multi-million dollar Shefferman work so closely\u2014and on what?\"<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/>\n\nBy the late 1940s, LRA had nearly 400 clients. Shefferman's operatives set up anti-union employee groups called \"Vote No\" committees, developed ruses to identify pro-union workers, and helped arrange sweetheart contracts with unions that would not challenge management.<ref name=\"Smith 98-99\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-99.</ref> Consultants from LRA \"committed numerous illegal actions, including bribery, coercion of employees and racketeering.\"<ref name=\"Logan 651-675\" />\n\nShefferman built \"a daunting business on a foundation of false premises\", of which \"perhaps the most incredible&mdash;and most widely believed&mdash;is the myth that companies are at a disadvantage to unions organizationally, legally, and financially during a union-organizing drive.\" What businesses sought to accomplish through such propaganda was for Congress to amend the [[National Labor Relations Act|Wagner Act]].<ref name=\"Levitt 35\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 35.</ref>\n\nOne of Shefferman's associates defined his technique simply by saying: \"We operate the exact way a union does,\" he said. \"But on management's side.

Many of those he regarded as pro-union were fired. A similar practice took place at the [[Morton Frozen Foods]] plant in [[Webster City, Iowa]]. An employee recruited by LRA operatives wrote down a list of employees thought to favor a union. Management fired those workers. The list-making employee received a substantial pay increase. When the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] union was defeated, Shefferman arranged a sweetheart contract with a union that Morton Frozen Foods controlled, with no participation from the workers. From 1949 through 1956, LRA earned nearly $2.5 million providing such anti-union services.<ref name=\"Smith 98-100\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-100.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]] (also known as the McClellan Committee) investigated unions for corruption, and employers and agencies for union busting activities. Labor Relations Associates was found to have committed violations of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, including manipulating union elections through bribery and coercion, threatening to revoke workers' benefits if they organized, installing union officers who were sympathetic to management, rewarding employees who worked against the union, and spying on and harassing workers.<ref name=\"Levitt 37-38\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 37-38.</ref> The McClellan Committee believed that \"the National Labor Relations Board [was] impotent to deal with Shefferman's type of activity.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 102\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 102.</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that employers availed themselves of anti-union services during the 1960s or the early 1970s.<ref>''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xvii.</ref> However, under a new reading of the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act|Landrum-Griffin Act]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] took action against consulting agencies related to filing of required reports in only three cases after 1966, and between 1968 and 1974 it filed no actions at all.

In the 1970s the number of consultants, and the scope and sophistication of their activities, increased substantially. As the numbers of consultants increased, the numbers of unions suffering [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] setbacks also increased. Labor's percentage of election wins slipped from 57 percent to 46 percent. The number of [[NLRB election procedures#Decertification elections|union decertification elections]] tripled, with a 73 percent loss rate for unions.<ref name=\"Levitt 102\"/>\n\nLabor relations consulting firms began providing seminars on union avoidance strategies in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Smith 105\">From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 105.</ref> Agencies moved from subverting unions to screening out union sympathizers during hiring, indoctrinating workforces, and propagandizing against unions.<ref name=\"Smith 108-114\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 108-114.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Congress had investigated, but failed to regulate, abuses by labor relations consulting firms.

It was enacted because Railroad management wanted to keep the trains moving by putting an end to \"wildcat\" strikes.

It established the right to organize unions. The [[Wagner Act]] was the most important labor law in American history and earned the nickname \"labor's bill of rights.\" It forbade employers from engaging in five types of labor practices: interfering with or restraining employees exercising their right to organize and bargain collectively; attempting to dominate or influence a labor union; refusing to bargain collectively and in \"good faith\" with unions representing their employees; and, finally, encouraging or discouraging union membership through any special conditions of employment or through discrimination against union or non-union members in hiring. Before the law, employers had liberty to spy upon, question, punish, blacklist, and fire union members. In the 1930s workers began to organize in large numbers. A great wave of work stoppages in 1933 and 1934 included citywide general strikes and [[occupation of factories|factory occupations]] by workers. Hostile skirmishes erupted between workers bent on organizing unions, and the police and hired security squads backing the interests of factory owners who opposed unions. Some historians maintain that Congress enacted the NLRA primarily to help stave off even more serious \u2014 potentially revolutionary \u2014 labor unrest.  Arriving at a time when organized labor had nearly lost faith in Roosevelt, the Wagner Act required employers to acknowledge labor unions that were favored by a majority of their work forces. The Act established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), with oversight over union elections and unfair labor practices by employers.<ref>[US History Online] http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1612.html</ref>\n\n===Taft-Hartley Act, 1947===\nThe [[Taft-Hartley Act]]<ref>(Full Text of Taft Hartley Act of 1947) {{cite web |url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/tafthartley.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208125122/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/tafthartley.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 }}</ref> was a major revision of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (the Wagner Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by a post-war Congress.

It defined specific employer rights which broadened an employer's options during union organizing drives. It banned the closed shop, in which union membership is a precondition of employment at an organized workplace. It allowed state \"right to work\" laws which prohibit mandatory union dues.\n\nThe act required union officials to swear that they were not communists. This provision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1965.<ref name=\"Levitt 36\" />\n\nThe act gave the president the power to petition the courts to end a strike if it constitutes a national emergency. Presidents have invoked the Taft-Hartley Act thirty-five times to halt work stoppages in labor disputes; almost all of the instances took place in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, under presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, after which the provision fell into disuse.

Levitt]]'s interpretation is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The law regulates labor unions' internal affairs and union officials' relationships with employers. But the law also required companies to report certain expenditures related to their anti-union activities. Fortunately for union busters, loopholes in the requirements allow management and their agents to ignore the provisions aimed at reforming their behavior.<ref name=\"Levitt 41\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 41.</ref> The loopholes require consultants to file if they communicate with employees either for the purpose of persuading them not to join a union, or to gain knowledge about the employees or the union that may be passed on to the employer. However, most consultants accomplish these goals by indirect means, using supervisors and management as their first line of contact with employees. Even before the Act was passed, labor consultants had identified front-line supervisors as the most effective lobbyists for management.<ref name=\"Levitt 42\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 42.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLandrum-Griffin also seeks to prevent consultants from spying on employees or the union. Information isn't to be compiled unless it is for the purpose of a specific legal proceeding.  According to Martin Levitt, \"It is easy for consultants to use this provision as a cover for \"all kinds of information gathering.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 42\" />\n\nAccording to [[Martin J. Levitt]], \"because of Landrum-Griffin's vague language, attorneys are able to directly interfere in the union-organizing process without any reporting requirements. Therefore, \"young lawyers run bold anti-union wars and dance all over Landrum-Griffin.\" The provisions of Landrum-Griffin allowing special rights for lawyers resulted in labor consultants working under the shield of labor attorneys, allowing them to easily evade the intent of the law.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 42-43\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 42-43. Note that a new '''Interpretation of the \"Advice\" Exemption in Section 203(c) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act''' was issued on January 8, 2001, partly as a result of Mr. Levitt's comments about these loopholes. The Bush administration delayed, and then rescinded, the new interpretation.</ref>\n\n[[Martin J.

As workers moved away from farm work to factories, mines and other hard labor, they faced harsh working conditions such as long hours, low pay and health risks. Children and women worked in factories and generally received lower pay than men.{{Citation needed|reason=Hard data figured would be good to know.|date=November 2019}} The government did little to limit these conditions.  Labor movements in the  industrialized world developed that lobbied for better rights and safer conditions.   Shaped by wars, depressions, government policies, judicial rulings, and global competition, the early years of the battleground between unions and management were adversarial and often identified with aggressive hostility.   Contemporary [[opposition to trade unions]] known as [[union busting]] started in the 1940s and continues to present challenges to the labor movement. Union busting is a term used by [[Labor union|labor]] organizations and [[trade unions]] to describe the activities that may be undertaken by  employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], [[card check]], [[organizing (management)|worker organizing]], and [[strike actions]].<ref>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5604656</ref>  Labor legislation has changed the nature of union busting, as well as the organizing tactics that labor organizations commonly use.\n\n== Strike breaking and union busting, 1870s-1935 ==\nHiring agencies specialising in anti-union practices has been an option available to employers from the bloody strikes of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, until today.<ref name=\"Smith xiv\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xiv.</ref>\n\nWorking with owner [[John D.

In 1907, [[Morris Friedman]] reported that a Pinkerton agent who had infiltrated the [[Western Federation of Miners]] managed to gain control of a strike relief fund, and [[James McParland#McParland in Colorado|attempted to exhaust that union's treasury]] by awarding lavish benefits to strikers.<ref name=\"Haywood\">''The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood'', William D. Haywood, 1929, pages 157-58.</ref> However, many attacks against unions have used force of one sort or another, including police action, military force, or recruiting [[goon squad]]s.\n\n===Physical attacks against unions===\nUnions such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) were devastated by the [[Palmer Raids]], carried out as part of the [[First Red Scare]]. The [[Everett Massacre]] (also known as Bloody Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities and IWW members which took place in [[Everett, Washington]] on Sunday, November 5, 1916. Later, [[communist]]-led unions were isolated or destroyed and their activists purged with the assistance of other union organizations during the [[Second Red Scare]].\n\n[[File:Haymarketstation.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's depiction of the Haymarket Square riot]]\nIn May 1886 the Knights of Labor were demonstrating in the [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Square]] in Chicago, demanding an [[eight-hour day]] in all trades. When police arrived, an unknown person threw a bomb into the crowd, killing one person and injuring several others. \"In a trial marked by prejudice and hysteria\" a court sentenced seven [[anarchists]], six of them German-speaking, to death - with no evidence linking them to the bomb.<ref>Tindall and Shi, 1984, p. 829.</ref>\n\nStrikes also took place that same month (May 1886) in other cities, including in Milwaukee, where seven people died when Wisconsin Governor [[Jeremiah McLain Rusk|Jeremiah M. Rusk]] ordered [[state militia|state-militia]] troops to fire upon thousands of striking workers who had marched to the Milwaukee Iron Works Rolling Mill in Bay View, on Milwaukee's south side.\n\nIn 1914 one of the most bitter labor conflicts in American history took place at a mining colony in Colorado called [[Ludlow massacre|Ludlow]]. After workers went on strike in September 1913 with grievances ranging from requests for an eight-hour day to allegations of subjugation, Colorado governor [[Elias Ammons]] called in the [[Colorado National Guard|National Guard]] in October 1913. That winter, Guardsmen made 172 arrests.{{efn|As the conflict dragged on, the state of Colorado was unable to pay the salaries of many National Guardsmen. As enlisted men dropped out, mine guards took their places, their uniforms, and their weapons.}}<ref name=\"kick263\">Kick et al., 2002, p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe strikers began to fight back, killing four mine guards and firing into a separate camp where strikebreakers lived. When the body of a strikebreaker was found nearby, the National Guard's General [[John Chase (doctor and soldier)|Chase]] ordered the tent colony destroyed in retaliation.<ref name=\"kick263\" />\n\n\"On Monday morning, April 20, two dynamite bombs were exploded, in the hills above Ludlow [...] a signal for operations to begin. At 9&nbsp;am a machine gun began firing into the tents [where strikers were living], and then others joined.\"<ref name=\"kick263\" /> One eyewitness reported: \"The soldiers and mine guards tried to kill everybody; anything they saw move\".<ref name=\"kick263\" /> That night the National Guard rode down from the hills surrounding Ludlow and set fire to the tents. Twenty-six people, including two women and eleven children, were killed.<ref>\nKick et al., 2002, p. 264.\n</ref>\n\n===Union busting with police and military force===\nFor approximately 150 years, union organizing efforts and strikes have been periodically opposed by police, security forces, [[United States National Guard|National Guard units]], special police forces such as the [[Coal and Iron Police]], and/or use of the [[United States Army]]. Significant incidents have included the [[Haymarket Riot]] and the [[Ludlow massacre]]. The [[Homestead strike|Homestead]] struggle of 1892, the [[Pullman strike|Pullman]] walkout of 1894, and the [[Colorado Labor Wars]] of 1903 are examples of unions destroyed or significantly damaged by the deployment of military force. In all three examples, a strike became the triggering event.\n\n*'''Pinkertons and militia at Homestead, 1892''' - One of the first union busting agencies was the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], which came to public attention as the result of a shooting war that broke out between strikers and three hundred Pinkerton agents during the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892. When the Pinkerton agents were withdrawn, state militia forces were deployed. The militia repulsed attacks on the steel plant, and prevented violence against strikebreakers crossing picket lines, causing a decisive defeat of the strike, and ended the power of the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] at the Homestead plant.\n*'''Federal troops end the railroad blockades by the American Railway Union, 1894''' - During the [[Pullman Strike]], the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), out of union solidarity, called out its members according to the principle of [[industrial unionism]]. Their actions in blocking the movement of railroad trains were illegal but successful, until twenty thousand federal troops were called out to ensure that trains carrying US mail could travel freely. Once the trains ran, the strike ended.\n*'''National Guard in the Colorado Labor Wars, 1903''' - The [[Colorado National Guard]], an employers' organization called the [[Citizens' Alliance]], and the [[Mine Owners' Association]] teamed together to eject the [[Western Federation of Miners]] from mining camps throughout Colorado during the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].\n\n===Anatomy of a corporate union buster===\n{{main|Corporations Auxiliary Company}}\n\n[[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], a union buster during the first half of the 20th century, would tell employers,\n\n<blockquote>Our man will come to your factory and get acquainted... If he finds little disposition to organize, he will not encourage organization, but will engineer things so as to keep organization out. If, however, there seems a disposition to organize he will become the leading spirit and pick out just the right men to join. Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.<ref>Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nIn the period 1933 to 1936, Corporations Auxiliary Company had 499 corporate clients.<ref>John J.

Stephen Norword discusses the phenomenon of students as strikebreakers in early 20th Century North America: \"Throughout the period between 1901 and 1923, college students represented a major, and often critically important source of strikebreakers in a wide range of industries and services. (\u2026) Collegians deliberately volunteered their services as strikebreakers and were the group least likely to be swayed by the pleas of strikers and their sympathizers that they were doing something wrong.\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Norwood\n | first = Stephen H.\n | authorlink = Stephen H.

Strikebreaking by recruiting massive numbers of replacement workers became a significant activity.\n\nJack Whitehead saw opportunity in labor struggles; while other workers were attempting to organize unions, he walked away from his union to organize an army of strikebreakers. Whitehead was the first to be called \"King of the Strike Breakers\"; by deploying his private workforce during strikes of steelworkers in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama]], he became wealthy. By demonstrating how lucrative strikebreaking could be, Whitehead inspired a host of imitators.<ref name=\"Smith 40\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 40.</ref>\n\n===James Farley inherits the strikebreaker title===\nAfter Whitehead, men like James A. Farley and [[Pearl Bergoff]] turned union busting into a substantial industry. Farley began his strikebreaking career in 1895, and opened a detective agency in [[New York City]] in 1902. In addition to detective work, Farley accepted industrial assignments, specializing in breaking strikes of streetcar drivers.<ref name=\"Smith 41\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 41.</ref> Farley hired his men based in part upon courage and toughness, and in some strikes they openly carried firearms. They were paid more than the strikers had been. Farley was credited with a string of successful strikebreaking actions, employing hundreds, and sometimes thousands of strikebreakers. Farley was sometimes paid as much as three hundred thousand dollars for breaking a strike, and by 1914 he had taken in more than ten million dollars. Farley claimed that he had defeated thirty-five strikes in a row. But he suffered from tuberculosis, and as he faced death, he declared that he turned down the job of breaking a streetcar strike in Philadelphia because this time, \"the strikers were in the right.\"<ref name=\"Smith 41-42, 45, 47-48, 53-54\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 41-42, 45, 47-48, and 53-54.</ref>\n\n===Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters===\n[[Pearl Bergoff]] also began his strikebreaking career in New York City, working as a [[Labor spies|spotter]] on the [[New York Railways|Metropolitan Street Railway]] in Manhattan. His job was to watch conductors, making certain that they recorded all of the fares that they accepted. In 1905 Bergoff started the Vigilant Detective Agency of [[New York City]]. Within two years his brothers joined the lucrative business, and the name was changed to the Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters. Bergoff's early strikebreaking actions were characterized by extreme violence. A 1907 strike of garbage cart drivers resulted in numerous confrontations between strikers and the strikebreakers, even when protected by police escorts. Strikers sometimes pelted the strikebreakers with rocks, bottles, and bricks launched from tenement rooftops.<ref name=\"Smith 55-56\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 55-56.</ref>\n\n[[File:Afl inconsequential american employer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Anti-union cartoon in monthly magazine ''The American Employer'' depicting the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] as a fly on the wheel, 1913]]In 1909, [[Pressed Steel Car Company|the Pressed Steel Car Company]] at [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]] fired forty men, and eight thousand employees walked out under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. Bergoff's agency hired strikebreaking toughs from the Bowery, and shipped vessels filled with unsuspecting immigrant workers directly into the strike zone. Other immigrant strikebreakers were delivered in boxcars, and were not fed during a two-day period. Later they worked, ate, and slept in a barn with two thousand other men. Their meals consisted of cabbage and bread.<ref name=\"Smith 58-59\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 58-59.</ref>\n\nThere were violent confrontations between strikers and strikebreakers, but also between strikebreakers and guards when the terrified workers demanded the right to leave. An Austro-Hungarian immigrant who managed to escape told his government that workers were being held against their will, resulting in an international incident. In addition to kidnapping, strikebreakers complained of deception, broken promises about wages, and tainted food.<ref name=\"Smith 59-60\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 59-60.</ref>\n\nDuring federal hearings, Bergoff explained that \"musclemen\" under his employ would \"get... any graft that goes on\", suggesting that was to be expected \"on every big job.\"<ref name=\"Smith 59-60\" /> Other testimony indicated that Bergoff's \"right-hand man\", described as \"huge in stature, weighing perhaps 240 pounds\", surrounded himself with thirty-five guards who intimidated and fleeced the strikebreakers, locking them into a boxcar prison with no sanitation facilities when they defied orders.<ref name=\"Smith 61\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 61.</ref>\n\nAt the end of August a gun battle erupted, leaving six dead, six dying, and fifty wounded. Public sympathy began to swing away from the company, and toward the strikers. Early in September the company acknowledged defeat and negotiated with the strikers. Twenty-two had died in the strike. But Bergoff's business wasn't hurt by the defeat; he boasted of having as many as ten thousand strikebreakers on his payroll.<ref name=\"Smith 61\" /> He was getting paid as much as two million dollars per strikebreaking job.<ref name=\"Smith 67\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 67.</ref>\n\n===Anti-union vigilantes during the First Red Scare===\nUnlike the [[American Federation of Labor]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] opposed the First World War. The [[American Protective League]] (APL) was a pro-war organization formed by wealthy Chicago businessmen. At the height of its power the APL had 250,000 members in 600 cities. In 1918, documents from the APL showed that ten percent of its efforts (the largest of any category) were focused on disrupting the activities of the IWW. The APL burgled and vandalized IWW offices, and harassed IWW members. Such actions were illegal, yet were supported by the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration.<ref name=\"APL\">Information from [[American Protective League]] Retrieved March 28, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Spies, \"missionaries,\" and saboteurs===\n[[File:Afl too powerful american employer.jpg|thumb|160px|Anti-union cartoon in monthly magazine ''The American Employer'' depicting the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] as a cannon aimed at a government building, 1914]]Strikebreaking by hiring massive numbers of tough opportunists began to lose favor in the 1920s; there were fewer strikes, resulting in fewer opportunities.<ref name=\"Smith 61\" /><ref name=\"Smith 68\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 68.</ref> By the 1930s, agencies began to rely more upon the use of [[Labor spies|informants and labor spies]].\n\nSpy agencies hired to bust unions developed a level of sophistication that could devastate targets. \"Missionaries\" were undercover operatives trained to use whispering campaigns or unfounded rumors to create dissension on the picket lines and in union halls. The strikers themselves were not the only targets. For example, female missionaries might systematically visit the strikers' wives in the home, relating a sob story of how a strike had destroyed their own families. Missionary campaigns have been known to destroy not only strikes, but unions themselves.<ref name=\"Smith 88-89\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 88-89.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the Pinkerton Agency employed twelve hundred labor spies, and nearly one-third of them held high level positions in the targeted unions. The [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers|International Association of Machinists]] was damaged when Sam Brady, a veteran Pinkerton operative, held a high enough position in that union that he was able to precipitate a premature strike. All but five officers in a [[United Auto Workers]] local in [[Lansing, Michigan]] were driven out by Pinkerton agents. The five who remained were Pinkertons. At the Underwood Elliott-Fisher Company plant, the union local was so badly injured by undercover operatives that membership dropped from more than twenty five hundred to fewer than seventy-five.<ref name=\"Smith 88\">From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 88.</ref>\n\n===General strikebreaking methods===\n\nDuring the period from roughly 1910 to 1914, [[Robert Hoxie]] compiled a list of methods used by employers' associations to attack unions. The list was published in 1921, as part of the book ''Trade Unionism in the United States''.  These methods include counter organization, inducing union leaders to support management, supporting other pro-business enterprises, refusing to work with pro-union enterprises, obtaining information on unions among others.<ref>[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-200.</ref>\n\nHoxie summarized the underlying theories, assumptions, and attitudes of employers' associations of the period. According to Hoxie, these included the supposition that employers' interests are always identical to society's interests, such that unions should be condemned when they interfere; that the employers' interests are always harmonious with the workers' interests, and unions therefore try to mislead workers; that workers should be grateful to employers, and are therefore ungrateful and immoral when they join unions; that the business is solely the employer's to manage; that unions are operated by non-employees, and they are therefore necessarily outsiders; that unions restrict the right of employees to work when, where, and how they wish; and that the law, the courts, and the police represent absolute and impartial rights and justice, and therefore unions are to be condemned when they violate the law or oppose the police.<ref>[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-96.</ref>\n\nGiven the proliferation of employers' associations created primarily for the purpose of opposing unions, Hoxie poses counter-questions. For example, if every employer has a right to manage his own business without interference from outside workers, then why hasn't a group of workers at a particular company the right to manage their own affairs without interference from outside employers?<ref>Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D.

(LRA) founded in 1939 by Nathan Shefferman, who later in 1961 wrote The Man in the Middle, [[Union busting#The first guide to modern union busting|a guide to union busting]], and has been considered the 'founding father' of the modern union avoidance industry.<ref name=\"Logan 651-675\" /> Shefferman had been a member of the original NLRB, and became director of employee relations at Chicago-based [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]. Sears had been engaged in blocking unions from the AFL Retail Clerks union  throughout the 1930s.  Sears provided $10,000 seed money to launch LRA.<ref name=\"Levitt 33-34\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 33-34.</ref>   In 1957 during hearings conducted by the United States, Congress, and Select Committees on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field.<ref>https://archive.org/details/investigationofi16unit</ref>  Nate Shefferman was questioned by Robert Kennedy and testimony revealed that Teamsters union \"top brass\" were regularly sent to meet with him.

An indicator of the close relationship between the Teamster's President David Beck and Shefferman (excerpted from the article):  \"Beck dispatched Shefferman to Jim Hoffa last year (1956) to offer Hoffa the union's presidency if Hoffa would first help re-elect Beck and then wait 6 months for Beck to resign on grounds of ill health\".  The article asks \"Why did Beck and the multi-million dollar Shefferman work so closely\u2014and on what?\"<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/>\n\nBy the late 1940s, LRA had nearly 400 clients. Shefferman's operatives set up anti-union employee groups called \"Vote No\" committees, developed ruses to identify pro-union workers, and helped arrange sweetheart contracts with unions that would not challenge management.<ref name=\"Smith 98-99\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-99.</ref> Consultants from LRA \"committed numerous illegal actions, including bribery, coercion of employees and racketeering.\"<ref name=\"Logan 651-675\" />\n\nShefferman built \"a daunting business on a foundation of false premises\", of which \"perhaps the most incredible&mdash;and most widely believed&mdash;is the myth that companies are at a disadvantage to unions organizationally, legally, and financially during a union-organizing drive.\" What businesses sought to accomplish through such propaganda was for Congress to amend the [[National Labor Relations Act|Wagner Act]].<ref name=\"Levitt 35\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 35.</ref>\n\nOne of Shefferman's associates defined his technique simply by saying: \"We operate the exact way a union does,\" he said. \"But on management's side.

Many of those he regarded as pro-union were fired. A similar practice took place at the [[Morton Frozen Foods]] plant in [[Webster City, Iowa]]. An employee recruited by LRA operatives wrote down a list of employees thought to favor a union. Management fired those workers. The list-making employee received a substantial pay increase. When the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] union was defeated, Shefferman arranged a sweetheart contract with a union that Morton Frozen Foods controlled, with no participation from the workers. From 1949 through 1956, LRA earned nearly $2.5 million providing such anti-union services.<ref name=\"Smith 98-100\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-100.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]] (also known as the McClellan Committee) investigated unions for corruption, and employers and agencies for union busting activities. Labor Relations Associates was found to have committed violations of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, including manipulating union elections through bribery and coercion, threatening to revoke workers' benefits if they organized, installing union officers who were sympathetic to management, rewarding employees who worked against the union, and spying on and harassing workers.<ref name=\"Levitt 37-38\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 37-38.</ref> The McClellan Committee believed that \"the National Labor Relations Board [was] impotent to deal with Shefferman's type of activity.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 102\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 102.</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that employers availed themselves of anti-union services during the 1960s or the early 1970s.<ref>''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xvii.</ref> However, under a new reading of the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act|Landrum-Griffin Act]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] took action against consulting agencies related to filing of required reports in only three cases after 1966, and between 1968 and 1974 it filed no actions at all.

In the 1970s the number of consultants, and the scope and sophistication of their activities, increased substantially. As the numbers of consultants increased, the numbers of unions suffering [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] setbacks also increased. Labor's percentage of election wins slipped from 57 percent to 46 percent. The number of [[NLRB election procedures#Decertification elections|union decertification elections]] tripled, with a 73 percent loss rate for unions.<ref name=\"Levitt 102\"/>\n\nLabor relations consulting firms began providing seminars on union avoidance strategies in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Smith 105\">From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 105.</ref> Agencies moved from subverting unions to screening out union sympathizers during hiring, indoctrinating workforces, and propagandizing against unions.<ref name=\"Smith 108-114\">''From Blackjacks To Briefcases &mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States'', Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 108-114.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Congress had investigated, but failed to regulate, abuses by labor relations consulting firms.

The RLA was amended in 1936 to expand from railroads and cover the emerging airline industry. At UPS, the mechanics, dispatchers, and pilots are the labor groups that are covered by the RLA.  It was enacted because Railroad management wanted to keep the trains moving by putting an end to \"wildcat\" strikes. Railroad workers wanted to make sure they had an opportunity to organize, be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent in dealing with a company, negotiate new agreements and enforce existing ones. Under the RLA, agreements do not have expiration dates; instead they have amendable dates which are indicated within the agreement.\n\n===Wagner Act, 1935===\nThe [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA),<ref>[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]http://www.nlrb.gov/about_us/overview/national_labor_relations_act.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905084607/http://www.nlrb.gov/About_Us/Overview/national_labor_relations_act.aspx |date=2009-09-05 }}</ref> often referred to as the [[Wagner Act]], was passed by Congress  July 5, 1935. It established the right to organize unions. The [[Wagner Act]] was the most important labor law in American history and earned the nickname \"labor's bill of rights.\" It forbade employers from engaging in five types of labor practices: interfering with or restraining employees exercising their right to organize and bargain collectively; attempting to dominate or influence a labor union; refusing to bargain collectively and in \"good faith\" with unions representing their employees; and, finally, encouraging or discouraging union membership through any special conditions of employment or through discrimination against union or non-union members in hiring. Before the law, employers had liberty to spy upon, question, punish, blacklist, and fire union members. In the 1930s workers began to organize in large numbers. A great wave of work stoppages in 1933 and 1934 included citywide general strikes and [[occupation of factories|factory occupations]] by workers. Hostile skirmishes erupted between workers bent on organizing unions, and the police and hired security squads backing the interests of factory owners who opposed unions. Some historians maintain that Congress enacted the NLRA primarily to help stave off even more serious \u2014 potentially revolutionary \u2014 labor unrest.  Arriving at a time when organized labor had nearly lost faith in Roosevelt, the Wagner Act required employers to acknowledge labor unions that were favored by a majority of their work forces. The Act established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), with oversight over union elections and unfair labor practices by employers.<ref>[US History Online] http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1612.html</ref>\n\n===Taft-Hartley Act, 1947===\nThe [[Taft-Hartley Act]]<ref>(Full Text of Taft Hartley Act of 1947) {{cite web |url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/tafthartley.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208125122/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/tafthartley.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 }}</ref> was a major revision of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (the Wagner Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by a post-war Congress. In the mid-term elections of 1946, the Republican Party gained majorities in both houses for the first time since 1931. With the Truman administration initially taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. In addition to overwhelming Republican support, a clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21-21.<ref>[http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal51-889-29661-1405696 \u201cTruman-Taft stands \u2013 point by point\u201d], CQ Almanac, 1951.</ref>\n\nThe [[Taft-Hartley Act]] was vehemently denounced by union officials, who dubbed it a \"slave labor\" bill.

It defined specific employer rights which broadened an employer's options during union organizing drives. It banned the closed shop, in which union membership is a precondition of employment at an organized workplace.

Levitt]]'s interpretation is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The law regulates labor unions' internal affairs and union officials' relationships with employers. But the law also required companies to report certain expenditures related to their anti-union activities. Fortunately for union busters, loopholes in the requirements allow management and their agents to ignore the provisions aimed at reforming their behavior.<ref name=\"Levitt 41\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 41.</ref> The loopholes require consultants to file if they communicate with employees either for the purpose of persuading them not to join a union, or to gain knowledge about the employees or the union that may be passed on to the employer. However, most consultants accomplish these goals by indirect means, using supervisors and management as their first line of contact with employees. Even before the Act was passed, labor consultants had identified front-line supervisors as the most effective lobbyists for management.<ref name=\"Levitt 42\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 42.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLandrum-Griffin also seeks to prevent consultants from spying on employees or the union. Information isn't to be compiled unless it is for the purpose of a specific legal proceeding.  According to Martin Levitt, \"It is easy for consultants to use this provision as a cover for \"all kinds of information gathering.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 42\" />\n\nAccording to [[Martin J. Levitt]], \"because of Landrum-Griffin's vague language, attorneys are able to directly interfere in the union-organizing process without any reporting requirements. Therefore, \"young lawyers run bold anti-union wars and dance all over Landrum-Griffin.\" The provisions of Landrum-Griffin allowing special rights for lawyers resulted in labor consultants working under the shield of labor attorneys, allowing them to easily evade the intent of the law.\"<ref name=\"Levitt 42-43\">''Confessions of a Union Buster'', Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 42-43.
