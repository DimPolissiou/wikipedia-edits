Dating the site has instead been based upon [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeomagnetism]], and the evidence of fossil flora and fauna in the sediments.\n\nMagnetic signatures within the sedimentary deposits indicate they were laid down between the two most recent geomagnetic reversals \u2013 the [[Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal]] around 780,000 years ago and the [[Jaramillo reversal]] around 950,000 to 1 million years ago.\n\nThe evidence of fossil flora and fauna using indicators such as the fossilized teeth of [[vole]]s, which provide very accurate dating evidence, pushes the lower limit back to at least 840,000 years ago.\n\nOn this basis, the range of possible dates for the deposition of the sediments that the footprints were found in stretches from 850,000 to 950,000 years ago, but further research is necessary to narrow the window.<ref name=\"CA288\" /><ref name=\"independent-2014-02-08\"/><ref>{{Cite web | title=Dating the site | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/featured_project_happisburgh/dating_the_site.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Pleistocene geography==\nAt the time the Happisburgh hominins lived, a land bridge existed between Britain and France before the formation of the [[English Channel]] about 450,000 years ago.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago have been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate; but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones found in the 1870s provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach.

Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

Dating the site has instead been based upon [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeomagnetism]], and the evidence of fossil flora and fauna in the sediments.\n\nMagnetic signatures within the sedimentary deposits indicate they were laid down between the two most recent geomagnetic reversals \u2013 the [[Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal]] around 780,000 years ago and the [[Jaramillo reversal]] around 950,000 to 1 million years ago.\n\nThe evidence of fossil flora and fauna using indicators such as the fossilized teeth of [[vole]]s, which provide very accurate dating evidence, pushes the lower limit back to at least 840,000 years ago.\n\nOn this basis, the range of possible dates for the deposition of the sediments that the footprints were found in stretches from 850,000 to 950,000 years ago, but further research is necessary to narrow the window.<ref name=\"CA288\" /><ref name=\"independent-2014-02-08\"/><ref>{{Cite web | title=Dating the site | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/featured_project_happisburgh/dating_the_site.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Pleistocene geography==\nAt the time the Happisburgh hominins lived, a land bridge existed between Britain and France before the formation of the [[English Channel]] about 450,000 years ago.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago have been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate; but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones found in the 1870s provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach.

Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \"Privy Council of Siam\" ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e24\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c}}; {{rtgs|''thi prueksa nai phra ong''}}) (49 members) and the \"Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''sapha thi prueksa ratchakan phaendin''}}) (12 members, name later changed to \"Council of Ministers\" ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''ratthamontrisapha''}})). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]].\n\nChulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \"Privy Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha kammakan ongkhamontri''}}). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at [[Thai New Year]] (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State.

They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}).

The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the [[Chakri Dynasty|royal family]].\n\n== List of presidents of the Privy Council==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!  ||Name|| Dates as President\n|-\n| 1 || Prince [[Dhani Nivat]] || 18 June 1949 \u2013 25 March 1950\n|-\n| 2 || Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]] || 25 March 1950 \u2013 7 March 1951\n|-\n| 3 || Prince [[Alongkot]] || 13 March 1951 \u2013 29 November 1951\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Jit na Songkhla]] || 27 May 1963 \u2013 14 July 1963\n|-\n| 4 || M.L.

When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State. The role of the Privy Council was relegated to minor legislative affairs, while the Supreme Council became Prajadhipok's main body of advisors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209084550/http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |archivedate=2009-02-09 }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 June 1932, a group calling themselves the [[Khana Ratsadon]] (or People's Party), together with the military, [[Siamese revolution of 1932|seized power in Bangkok]]. They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of:\n[[File:Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council.jpg|thumb|[[King Rama IX]] at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953]]\n* Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat, President of the council\n* Prince [[Dhani Nivat]], Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon\n* Prince [[Alongkot]], Prince Adisorn Udomsak\n* Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla)\n* Police General Adul Aduldejjarus\n\nTwo years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \"Privy Council of Thailand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha ongkhamontri''}}) or ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana ongkhamontri''}}). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the [[Chakri Dynasty|royal family]].\n\n== List of presidents of the Privy Council==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!  ||Name|| Dates as President\n|-\n| 1 || Prince [[Dhani Nivat]] || 18 June 1949 \u2013 25 March 1950\n|-\n| 2 || Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]] || 25 March 1950 \u2013 7 March 1951\n|-\n| 3 || Prince [[Alongkot]] || 13 March 1951 \u2013 29 November 1951\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Jit na Songkhla]] || 27 May 1963 \u2013 14 July 1963\n|-\n| 4 || M.L.
