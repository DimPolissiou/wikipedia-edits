This article offers an elementary introduction to the concept, whereas the article on the Bernoulli process offers a more advanced treatment.\n\nSince a Bernoulli trial has only two possible outcomes, it can be framed as some \"yes or no\" question. For example:\n\n*Is the top card of a shuffled deck an ace?\n*Was the newborn child a girl? (See [[human sex ratio]].)\n\nTherefore, success and failure are merely labels for the two outcomes, and should not be construed literally. The term \"success\" in this sense consists in the result meeting specified conditions, not in any moral judgement. More generally, given any [[probability space]], for any [[Event (probability theory)|event]] (set of outcomes), one can define a Bernoulli trial, corresponding to whether the event occurred or not (event or [[complementary event]]). Examples of Bernoulli trials include:\n\n*Flipping a coin. In this context, obverse (\"heads\") conventionally denotes success and reverse (\"tails\") denotes failure. A [[fair coin]] has the probability of success 0.5 by definition. In this case there are exactly two possible outcomes.\n*Rolling a {{dice}}, where a six is \"success\" and everything else a \"failure\". In this case there are six possible outcomes, and the event is a six; the complementary event \"not a six\" corresponds to the other five possible outcomes.\n*In conducting a political [[opinion poll]], choosing a voter at random to ascertain whether that voter will vote \"yes\" in an upcoming referendum.\n\n==Definition==\nIndependent repeated trials of an experiment with exactly two possible outcomes are called Bernoulli trials. Call one of the outcomes \"success\" and the other outcome \"failure\". Let <math>p</math> be the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and <math>q</math> be the probability of failure.
