Following the Spike Lee soundtrack success the band signed a deal with Virgin Records and scored two additional Top Billboard Hits. The first hit was \"[[Buck Wild (song)|Buck Wild]]\" which was co-written and co-produced by William \"Ju Ju\" House and the late Kent Wood. \"Buck Wild\" peaked at #7 on the R&B/Hip Hop Charts. The second Top Billboard hit following the group's #1 R&B hit \"Da Butt\" was released on February 2, 1988.\n\n\"[[Taste of Your Love]],\" sang by E.U.'s lead singer, Edward \"Junie\" Henderson, was the band's last Billboard top-ten hit. It was co-written (along with Harold \"Chucky\" Lloyd) and produced by Marvin Ennis. Ennis also played all of the instruments and did all of the background vocals on the track contrary to what the credits on the ''Livin' Large'' album reflect. The song \"Da Butt\" and the actual band which included Gregory Elliott, William House, Ivan Goff, Kent Wood, Valentino Jackson, Edward Henderson, Mike Taylor, Darryl Hayes, and J. Foxx, were featured in Spike Lee's film ''[[School Daze]].''\" The song was written by Marcus Miller and performed by E.U. The song reached number one on the Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart[1] for the week of April 23, 1988, and was ranked #61 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s. The music video was directed by Spike Lee.\n\nE.U. further injected DC go-go into the public consciousness with the release of [[Beck]]'s \"[[Where It's At (Beck song)|Where It's At]]\", a mid 1990s [[Alternative rock|alt-radio]] staple. The [[Dust Brothers]], who produced Beck's accompanying album, ''[[Odelay]]'' sampled the intro break from E.U.'s \"Knock Him Out Sugar Ray.\"\n\nE.U. experienced a resurgence in the mid to late 1990s, by partnering with the jazz, gospel, pop and gospel session singer, Maiesha Rashad, while performing under the name Maiesha and The Hip Huggers featuring E.U.

{"title_page": "Greek to me", "text_new": "'''That's Greek to me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339</ref> Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L.

me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339</ref> Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L.

This list spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the [[United States]].\n\nPrior to the creation of the Hot 100, ''Billboard'' published four singles charts: \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\", \"Most Played in Jukeboxes\" and \"The Top 100\". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.\n\nAll items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts).\n\n==All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958\u20132018)==\nIn 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, ''Billboard'' magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|title=Hot 100 Anniversary: Find Out The Top Songs Of All Time|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002736/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=live}} This contains the heading of the article only, no charts.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart: 50th Anniversary|access-date=January 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112214920/http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|archive-date=January 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary Central|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122171013/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|title=Greatest Hot 100 Songs & Artists of All Time: Chubby Checker's 'The Twist' & The Beatles Reign|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805064308/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|archive-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the ''Billboard'' chart's 60th anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|title=The Biggest Hits of All: The Hot 100's All-Time Top 100 Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=August 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515110750/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|archive-date=May 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018.

These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.\n\nAll items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts).\n\n==All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958\u20132018)==\nIn 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, ''Billboard'' magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|title=Hot 100 Anniversary: Find Out The Top Songs Of All Time|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002736/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=live}} This contains the heading of the article only, no charts.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart: 50th Anniversary|access-date=January 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112214920/http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|archive-date=January 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary Central|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122171013/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|title=Greatest Hot 100 Songs & Artists of All Time: Chubby Checker's 'The Twist' & The Beatles Reign|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805064308/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|archive-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the ''Billboard'' chart's 60th anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|title=The Biggest Hits of All: The Hot 100's All-Time Top 100 Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=August 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515110750/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|archive-date=May 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018.

If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1.\n\n*Note: For singer [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], if [[Black Eyed Peas]] is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at #1.\n*Note: For singer [[Michael Jackson]], if [[The Jackson 5]], which would also be later known as The Jacksons is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at #1.\n*Note: For singer [[Beyonc\u00e9]], if [[Destiny's Child]] is included, this would give Beyonc\u00e9 59 cumulative weeks at #1. All six weeks from the [[Perfect (Ed Sheeran song)|Perfect]] duet with Ed Sheeran are also included.\n*Note: For singer [[Diana Ross]], if [[The Supremes]] are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at #1.  \n*Note: For each of the Beatles:\n**If [[John Lennon]]'s total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at #1.\n**If [[Paul McCartney]]'s total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at #1.\n**If [[George Harrison]]'s total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at #1.\n**If [[Ringo Starr]]'s total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at #1.\n*Note: For rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] if the track \"[[Sicko Mode]]\" is included, this would put Drake on the list with 50 weeks at #1.\n\n===Most consecutive number-one singles===\n<!-- Only 5 hits or more -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Number of <br />singles\n!Artist\n!First hit and date\n!Final hit and date\n!Streak-breaking song\n|-\n|<center>7</center>\n|Whitney Houston\n|\"[[Saving All My Love for You]]\" <br />(October 26, 1985)\n|\"[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]\" <br />(April 23, 1988)\n|\"[[Love Will Save the Day]]\" <br />(#9 \u2013 August 27, 1988)\n|-\n|rowspan=2| <center>6</center>\n|The Beatles\n|\"[[I Feel Fine]]\" <br />(December 26, 1964)\n|\"[[We Can Work It Out]]\" <br />(January 8, 1966)\n|\"[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]\" <br />(#3 \u2013 March 26, 1966)\n|-\n|[[Bee Gees]]\n|\"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" <br />(December 24, 1977)\n|\"[[Love You Inside Out]]\" <br />(June 9, 1979)\n|\"[[He's A Liar]]\" <br />(#30 \u2013 October 24, 1981)\n|-\n|rowspan=6| <center>5</center>\n|Elvis Presley\n|\"[[A Big Hunk o' Love]]\" <br />(August 10, 1959)\n|\"[[Surrender (Elvis Presley song)|Surrender]]\" <br />(March 20, 1961)\n|\"[[I Feel So Bad (Chuck Willis song)|I Feel So Bad]]\" <br />(#5 \u2013 May 1961)\n|-\n|The Supremes\n|\"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\" <br />(August 22, 1964)\n|\"[[Back in My Arms Again]]\" <br />(June 12, 1965)\n|\"[[Nothing but Heartaches]]\" <br />(#11 \u2013 September 4, 1965)\n|-\n|Michael Jackson\n|\"[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]\" <br /> (with [[Siedah Garrett]]) <br />(September 19, 1987)\n|\"[[Dirty Diana]]\" <br />(July 2, 1988)\n|\"[[Another Part of Me]]\" <br />(#11 \u2013 September 10, 1988)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Mariah Carey\n|\"[[Vision of Love]]\" <br />(August 4, 1990)\n|\"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\" <br />(October 12, 1991)\n|\"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" <br />(#2 \u2013 January 25, 1992)\n|-\n|\"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\" <br />(September 30, 1995)\n|\"[[My All]]\" <br />(May 23, 1998)\n|\"[[When You Believe]]\" (with Whitney Houston)<br />(#15 \u2013 January 30, 1999)\n|-\n|Katy Perry\n|\"[[California Gurls]]\" (featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]) <br />(June 19, 2010)\n|\"[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]\" <br />(August 17, 2011)\n|\"[[The One That Got Away (Katy Perry song)|The One That Got Away]]\" <br />(#3 \u2013 January 7, 2012)\n|}\n\n:* Houston's \"[[Thinking About You (Whitney Houston song)|Thinking About You]]\" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio.

He expresses the hope that Deutscher's love of melody might help opera reconnect with the wider public and inject new life into the world of opera, which is so often pronounced dead nowadays. However, he also expresses the fear that (what he terms) 'advanced culture-theorists' would regard Deutscher's love of melody as a threat, and accuse it of 'anachronism', 'cultural populism'.\n\nIn February 2017, Deutscher made a public statement about her style, her love of melody, and her musical aesthetics, in a message to a press conference of the Carinthian Summer Music Festival in Austria. She explained that some people have told her that she should not compose beautiful melodies in the twenty-first century, because music must reflect the complexity and ugliness of the modern world. \"But I think that these people just got a little bit confused.

Perhaps this is a message that there is more to European Culture than just dissonance. Perhaps there is also a place in European Culture for harmony.

He concluded that it is a misconception to believe that the language of music must constantly move 'forward' or that composers need to invent the wheel each time anew. \"The world turns in a circle\", he wrote, \"but always sprouts new, beautiful flowers, if one only lets them sprout.\"\n\nDeutscher herself has often stressed her strong affinity to the musical language of the Viennese Classics.

He expresses the hope that Deutscher's love of melody might help opera reconnect with the wider public and inject new life into the world of opera, which is so often pronounced dead nowadays. However, he also expresses the fear that (what he terms) 'advanced culture-theorists' would regard Deutscher's love of melody as a threat, and accuse it of 'anachronism', 'cultural populism'.\n\nIn February 2017, Deutscher made a public statement about her style, her love of melody, and her musical aesthetics, in a message to a press conference of the Carinthian Summer Music Festival in Austria. She explained that some people have told her that she should not compose beautiful melodies in the twenty-first century, because music must reflect the complexity and ugliness of the modern world. \"But I think that these people just got a little bit confused.

Perhaps this is a message that there is more to European Culture than just dissonance. Perhaps there is also a place in European Culture for harmony.

He concluded that it is a misconception to believe that the language of music must constantly move 'forward' or that composers need to invent the wheel each time anew. \"The world turns in a circle\", he wrote, \"but always sprouts new, beautiful flowers, if one only lets them sprout.\"\n\nDeutscher herself has often stressed her strong affinity to the musical language of the Viennese Classics.

The program suspended operations after 1906 and remained shuttered for 20 years. When the team returned to the ice they brought with them their first official head coach. Though James Gardner only lasted one season behind the bench the team performed much better with a hand at the tiller and quickly built up to be a respected program. In 1939 the team again suspended operations, but this time it was due to the onset of [[World War II]]. Brown's team remained out of commission for the entire duration of the war and didn't return until several years after its conclusion, finally hitting the ice again in 1947. \n\nIn only 4 years the team climbed all the way to 17-5 record, receiving the top eastern seed for the [[1951 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1951 NCAA tournament]]. Though they ultimately fell in the title game Brown had become one of the better teams in college hockey and, excluding a brief period in the earls '60s, would remain so for the next 30 years. When the 1980s rolled around the Bears result started turning sour and Brown found itself looking up at the rest of college hockey. Since 1981 Brown has produced only six winning seasons and more than half of their campaigns have ended with single-digit win totals.

The program suspended operations after 1906 and remained shuttered for 20 years. When the team returned to the ice they brought with them their first official head coach. Though James Gardner only lasted one season behind the bench the team performed much better with a hand at the tiller and quickly built up to be a respected program. In 1939 the team again suspended operations, but this time it was due to the onset of [[World War II]]. Brown's team remained out of commission for the entire duration of the war and didn't return until several years after its conclusion, finally hitting the ice again in 1947. \n\nIn only 4 years the team climbed all the way to 17-5 record, receiving the top eastern seed for the [[1951 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1951 NCAA tournament]]. Though they ultimately fell in the title game Brown had become one of the better teams in college hockey and, excluding a brief period in the earls '60s, would remain so for the next 30 years. When the 1980s rolled around the Bears result started turning sour and Brown found itself looking up at the rest of college hockey. Since 1981 Brown has produced only six winning seasons and more than half of their campaigns have ended with single-digit win totals. The Bears had a brief resurgence in the mid-90's, managing to make the tournament in [[1993 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1993]] but bowed out after only 1 game.\n\n==Season-by-season results<ref name = results></ref>==\n\n{{Main article|List of Brown Bears men's ice hockey seasons}}\n\n==Brown Olympians<ref>{{cite web |url=https://brownbears.com/sports/2018/5/10/brown-mens-hockey-all-time-olympians.aspx?id=2843 |title=Brown Men's Hockey All-Time Olympians |publisher=Brown Bears |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref>==\nBrown has sent five members of its team to the Olympics.
