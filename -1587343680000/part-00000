Tevye is a pious [[Jews in Russia|Jewish]] [[milkman]] living in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], the patriarch of a family including several troublesome daughters.{{Efn | In the first short story, there is also a mention of a seventh daughter; in ''Fiddler,'' however, there are only five daughters (using the first five names listed above), of whom only the first three have major roles.}} The village of Boyberik, where the stories are set (renamed Anatevka in ''Fiddler on the Roof),'' is based on the town of [[Boyarka]], Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]].{{Efn | In ''Fiddler,'' the town name is Anatevka.}} The stories were written in [[Yiddish]] and first published in 1894; they have been published as ''Tevye and His Daughters'', ''Tevye's Daughters'', ''Tevye the Milkman'', and ''Tevye the Dairyman''.\n\nAs Tevye \"tells\" Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Beilke, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Tzeitel) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye's stories.  The stories tell of his business dealings, the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters, and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.\n\nThe Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times. Sholem Aleichem's own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919. (Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.) The Broadway musical was based on a play written by [[Arnold Perl]] called ''Tevye and His Daughters''. ''Tevye the Dairyman'' had four film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), Hebrew (1968), English (1971) and Russian (2017).\n\n== Name ==\nTevye's name in Hebrew is \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d1, ''Tuvya ha-cholev'', {{IPA-he|tov\u02c8ja (h)a\u03c7o\u02c8lev|}}, ''Tevye'' being the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of [[Tobias]].\n\n==English translations==\n''Tevye the Dairyman'' comprises eight stories, with Tevye each time supposedly meeting Sholom Aleichem by chance and relating the latest tale of his trials and tribulations.  They have been published in translation under the following titles:<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = [[Hillel Halkin]] transl | publisher = [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] | year = 1987 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories | series = Library of Yiddish Classics | ISBN = 0-8052-1069-5}}</ref>\n# ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'' (also translated as ''Tevye Wins a Fortune'' or ''The Great Windfall'')\n# ''Tevye Blows A Small Fortune'' (also translated as ''The Roof Falls In'' or ''The Bubble Bursts'')\n# ''Today's Children'' (also translated as ''Modern Children'')\n# ''Hodel''\n# ''Chava''\n# ''Shprintze''\n# ''Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel'' (also translated as ''Tevye Goes to Palestine'' or ''Tevye is Going to Eretz Yisroel'')\n# ''Lekh-Lekho'' (also translated as ''Get Thee Out'')\n\nThe original stories included events not depicted in ''Fiddler on the Roof''. For instance, by the time of the events of ''Lekh-Lekho'', Tevye's wife Golde and Tzeitl's husband Motl (Motel) have both died (Tevye's daughter Shprintze is also dead, as stated in the story \"Shprintze\"). Also, in ''Lekh-Lekho'', upon learning of the Jews' expulsion, Chava leaves her [[Russian Orthodox]] husband, wanting to return to her family and share their exile. Aleichem leaves it to the reader to decide whether or not Tevye forgives her and takes her back, saying:\n{{Quote | Put yourself in Tevye's place and tell me honestly, in plain language, what you would have done\u2026 ''(Hillel Halkin translation)''.}}\n\nand ending the story with \"The old God of Israel still lives!\"\n\nA 2009 translation includes a final short story titled ''Vachalaklokos'' that takes place after ''Lekh-Lekho''.<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = Aliza Shevrin transl | publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | series = [[Penguin Classics|Classics]] | year = 2009 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and Motl the Cantor's Son | ISBN = 0-1431-0560-4}}</ref>\n\nOther translations include:\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | others = Miriam Katz transl | publisher = Pangloss | year = 1994 | title = Sholem Aleykhem's Tevye the Dairyman | edition = complete, illustrated | ISBN = 0-9347-1031-7}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | others = Frances Butwin transl | title = Tevye's Daughters: Collected Stories of Sholom Aleichem | origyear = Crown Publishers, 1949 | publisher = Sholom Aleichem Family | year = 1999 | ISBN = 1-9290-6803-4 | author-mask = 3}}; for many years, this translation seems to have been the standard published version.\n\nThe story \"Tevye Strikes It Rich\" was adapted for children by Gabriel Lisowski in 1976 and published under the title ''How Tevye Became a Milkman\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Labriel | last = Lisowski | others = adapted by permission of the Family of Sholem Aleichem | publisher = [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rhinehart & Winston]] | year = 1976 | title = How Tevye Became a Milkman | ISBN = 0-03-016636-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/howtevyebecamemi00liso }}</ref>\n\n===Audio adaptations===\nThe Tevye stories have been recorded and commercially released twice:\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | series = Audio Renaissance | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Audio | year = 1987 | title = The Stories of Tevye the Dairyman | ISBN = 978-1-55927379-4 | others = [[Theodore Bikel]] narrator | edition = unabridged}}, with six of the stories: ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'', ''Tevye Blows a Small Fortune'', ''Today's Children'', ''Hodl'', ''Chava'' and ''Lekh-Lekho''.\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | publisher = [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Audiobooks | year = 2009 | title = Tevye the Milkman | series = Classic Fiction | ISBN = 978-962634934-2 | edition = unabridged | others = Neville Jason narrator | author-mask = 3}}.\n\nAn audio production of [[Arnold Perl]]'s play ''Tevya and His Daughters'' was released by [[Columbia Masterworks Records|Columbia Masterworks]] in 1957 (OL 5225); the cast included [[Mike Kellin]] as Tevya, Anna Vita Berger as Golde/The Rich Woman, [[Joan Harvey]] as Tzeitl, Carroll Conroy as Hodl, and [[Howard Da Silva]] (who also directed the production) as Lazar Wolf/The Rich Merchant/The Rabbi.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Various-Tevya-And-His-Daughters/release/10776323</ref>\n\nThe [[NPR]]/[[Yiddish Book Center]] 13-part mid-1990s radio series ''Great Jewish Stories from Eastern Europe and Beyond'', hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]],<ref>https://burnsfilmcenter.org/test-jff-stories/</ref> broadcast a reading of the story \"Chava\" performed by [[Walter Matthau]].\n\n== Portrayals ==\n[[Zero Mostel]] and [[Chaim Topol]] are the two actors most associated with the role of Tevye, although [[Theodore Bikel]] performed it many times on stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/24/entertainment/la-et-cm-theodore-bikel-tevye-20130825|title=Theodore Bikel and Tevye, the perfect match|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> For the film version of ''Fiddler on the Roof'', the part ultimately went to Topol, as producer-director [[Norman Jewison]] felt that Mostel's portrayal was too unnecessarily comic.

He also portrayed the character nearly 3,500 times on stage, retiring the role in 2009.\n\nOther noteworthy musical Tevyes have included [[Luther Adler]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Paul Lipson]] (original Broadway run, over 2,000 performances), [[Leonard Nimoy]] (1971 touring company), [[Shmuel Rodensky]] (original Israeli, Yiddish and German productions), [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]] (2004 Broadway revival), [[Henry Goodman]] (2007 London revival), [[Danny Burstein]] (2015 Broadway revival), [[Yehezkel Lazarov]] (2018 touring company) and Steven Skybell (2018 Off-Broadway revival in Yiddish).

The earliest screen version was an American silent film called [[Broken Barriers (1919 film)|Broken Barriers]], based on Aleichem's own theatrical treatment and released in 1919 (just a few years after Aleichem died). In 1962  Gerhard Klingenberg directed the television film ''Tuvia Vesheva Benotav'', released in English as ''[[Tevye and His Seven Daughters]]''. After ''Fiddler on the Roof'' became a Broadway sensation, an Israeli film called ''Tuvia Vesheva Benotav'' (also \"Tevye and His Seven Daughters\") starring [[Shmuel Rodensky]] was released in 1968, as well as two Russian versions: ''Teve-molochnik'' (Tevye the Milkman) in 1985 and ''Myr vashomu domu!''

Tevye is a pious [[Jews in Russia|Jewish]] milkman living in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], the patriarch of a family including several troublesome daughters.{{Efn | In the first short story, there is also a mention of a seventh daughter; in ''Fiddler,'' however, there are only five daughters (using the first five names listed above), of whom only the first three have major roles.}} The village of Boyberik, where the stories are set (renamed Anatevka in ''Fiddler on the Roof),'' is based on the town of [[Boyarka]], Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]].{{Efn | In ''Fiddler,'' the town name is Anatevka.}} The stories were written in [[Yiddish]] and first published in 1894; they have been published as ''Tevye and His Daughters'', ''Tevye's Daughters'', ''Tevye the Milkman'', and ''Tevye the Dairyman''.\n\nAs Tevye \"tells\" Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Beilke, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Tzeitel) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye's stories.  The stories tell of his business dealings, the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters, and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.\n\nThe Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times. Sholem Aleichem's own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919. (Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.) The Broadway musical was based on a play written by [[Arnold Perl]] called ''Tevye and His Daughters''. ''Tevye the Dairyman'' had four film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), Hebrew (1968), English (1971) and Russian (2017).\n\n== Name ==\nTevye's name in Hebrew is \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d1, ''Tuvya ha-cholev'', {{IPA-he|tov\u02c8ja (h)a\u03c7o\u02c8lev|}}, ''Tevye'' being the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of [[Tobias]].\n\n==English translations==\n''Tevye the Dairyman'' comprises eight stories, with Tevye each time supposedly meeting Sholom Aleichem by chance and relating the latest tale of his trials and tribulations.  They have been published in translation under the following titles:<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = [[Hillel Halkin]] transl | publisher = [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] | year = 1987 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories | series = Library of Yiddish Classics | ISBN = 0-8052-1069-5}}</ref>\n# ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'' (also translated as ''Tevye Wins a Fortune'' or ''The Great Windfall'')\n# ''Tevye Blows A Small Fortune'' (also translated as ''The Roof Falls In'' or ''The Bubble Bursts'')\n# ''Today's Children'' (also translated as ''Modern Children'')\n# ''Hodel''\n# ''Chava''\n# ''Shprintze''\n# ''Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel'' (also translated as ''Tevye Goes to Palestine'' or ''Tevye is Going to Eretz Yisroel'')\n# ''Lekh-Lekho'' (also translated as ''Get Thee Out'')\n\nThe original stories included events not depicted in ''Fiddler on the Roof''. For instance, by the time of the events of ''Lekh-Lekho'', Tevye's wife Golde and Tzeitl's husband Motl (Motel) have both died (Tevye's daughter Shprintze is also dead, as stated in the story \"Shprintze\"). Also, in ''Lekh-Lekho'', upon learning of the Jews' expulsion, Chava leaves her [[Russian Orthodox]] husband, wanting to return to her family and share their exile. Aleichem leaves it to the reader to decide whether or not Tevye forgives her and takes her back, saying:\n{{Quote | Put yourself in Tevye's place and tell me honestly, in plain language, what you would have done\u2026 ''(Hillel Halkin translation)''.}}\n\nand ending the story with \"The old God of Israel still lives!\"\n\nA 2009 translation includes a final short story titled ''Vachalaklokos'' that takes place after ''Lekh-Lekho''.<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = Aliza Shevrin transl | publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | series = [[Penguin Classics|Classics]] | year = 2009 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and Motl the Cantor's Son | ISBN = 0-1431-0560-4}}</ref>\n\nOther translations include:\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | others = Miriam Katz transl | publisher = Pangloss | year = 1994 | title = Sholem Aleykhem's Tevye the Dairyman | edition = complete, illustrated | ISBN = 0-9347-1031-7}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | others = Frances Butwin transl | title = Tevye's Daughters: Collected Stories of Sholom Aleichem | origyear = Crown Publishers, 1949 | publisher = Sholom Aleichem Family | year = 1999 | ISBN = 1-9290-6803-4 | author-mask = 3}}; for many years, this translation seems to have been the standard published version.\n\nThe story \"Tevye Strikes It Rich\" was adapted for children by Gabriel Lisowski in 1976 and published under the title ''How Tevye Became a Milkman\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Labriel | last = Lisowski | others = adapted by permission of the Family of Sholem Aleichem | publisher = [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rhinehart & Winston]] | year = 1976 | title = How Tevye Became a Milkman | ISBN = 0-03-016636-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/howtevyebecamemi00liso }}</ref>\n\n===Audio adaptations===\nThe Tevye stories have been recorded and commercially released twice:\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | series = Audio Renaissance | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Audio | year = 1987 | title = The Stories of Tevye the Dairyman | ISBN = 978-1-55927379-4 | others = [[Theodore Bikel]] narrator | edition = unabridged}}, with six of the stories: ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'', ''Tevye Blows a Small Fortune'', ''Today's Children'', ''Hodl'', ''Chava'' and ''Lekh-Lekho''.\n* {{Citation | first = Sholem | last = Aleichem | publisher = [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Audiobooks | year = 2009 | title = Tevye the Milkman | series = Classic Fiction | ISBN = 978-962634934-2 | edition = unabridged | others = Neville Jason narrator | author-mask = 3}}.\n\nAn audio production of [[Arnold Perl]]'s play ''Tevya and His Daughters'' was released by [[Columbia Masterworks Records|Columbia Masterworks]] in 1957 (OL 5225); the cast included [[Mike Kellin]] as Tevya, Anna Vita Berger as Golde/The Rich Woman, [[Joan Harvey]] as Tzeitl, Carroll Conroy as Hodl, and [[Howard Da Silva]] (who also directed the production) as Lazar Wolf/The Rich Merchant/The Rabbi.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Various-Tevya-And-His-Daughters/release/10776323</ref>\n\nThe [[NPR]]/[[Yiddish Book Center]] 13-part mid-1990s radio series ''Great Jewish Stories from Eastern Europe and Beyond'', hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]],<ref>https://burnsfilmcenter.org/test-jff-stories/</ref> broadcast a reading of the story \"Chava\" performed by [[Walter Matthau]].\n\n== Portrayals ==\n[[Zero Mostel]] and [[Chaim Topol]] are the two actors most associated with the role of Tevye, although [[Theodore Bikel]] performed it many times on stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/24/entertainment/la-et-cm-theodore-bikel-tevye-20130825|title=Theodore Bikel and Tevye, the perfect match|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> For the film version of ''Fiddler on the Roof'', the part ultimately went to Topol, as producer-director [[Norman Jewison]] felt that Mostel's portrayal was too unnecessarily comic.

He also portrayed the character nearly 3,500 times on stage, retiring the role in 2009.\n\nOther noteworthy musical Tevyes have included [[Luther Adler]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Paul Lipson]] (original Broadway run, over 2,000 performances), [[Leonard Nimoy]] (1971 touring company), [[Shmuel Rodensky]] (original Israeli, Yiddish and German productions), [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]] (2004 Broadway revival), [[Henry Goodman]] (2007 London revival), [[Danny Burstein]] (2015 Broadway revival), [[Yehezkel Lazarov]] (2018 touring company) and Steven Skybell (2018 Off-Broadway revival in Yiddish).

The earliest screen version was an American silent film called [[Broken Barriers (1919 film)|Broken Barriers]], based on Aleichem's own theatrical treatment and released in 1919 (just a few years after Aleichem died). In 1962  Gerhard Klingenberg directed the television film ''Tuvia Vesheva Benotav'', released in English as ''[[Tevye and His Seven Daughters]]''. After ''Fiddler on the Roof'' became a Broadway sensation, an Israeli film called ''Tuvia Vesheva Benotav'' (also \"Tevye and His Seven Daughters\") starring [[Shmuel Rodensky]] was released in 1968, as well as two Russian versions: ''Teve-molochnik'' (Tevye the Milkman) in 1985 and ''Myr vashomu domu!''

In Berga, the earliest conserved reference to a Corpus procession is May 20, 1454{{ref}}. The festival evolved and incorporated more elements popular and religious theater in the [[Middle Ages]], leading to a unique combination of giants, devils, angels, moors, and other bizarre-looking characters.\n\nDespite the religious significance of Corpus Christi, and the Patum's descent from \"[[eucharist]]ic performances,\" in its present form it is rather a show of popular theater. It is unique in Catalonia.

In Berga, the earliest conserved reference to a Corpus procession is May 20, 1454{{ref}}. The festival evolved and incorporated more elements popular and religious theater in the [[Middle Ages]], leading to a unique combination of giants, devils, angels, moors, and other bizarre-looking characters.\n\nDespite the religious significance of Corpus Christi, and the Patum's descent from \"[[eucharist]]ic performances,\" in its present form it is rather a show of popular theater. It is unique in Catalonia.

Most of the community was lost to a fire in 1892;<ref name=gaz>An Historical Gazetteer of Butler County, Pennsylvania, pp. 125.</ref> however, with the area being a major rail hub, many of the structures were rebuilt. The community was incorporated into a borough in 1905.\n\n=== Railroad center ===\nLocated along the [[P&W Subdivision]], the borough was originally a small [[Request stop|whistle stop]] on the [[Pittsburgh and Western Railroad]]. However, by the turn of the 20th century, Callery became a prosperous railroad community with the completion of the [[Northern Subdivision (Pennsylvania)|Northern Subdivision]],<ref name=gaz /> which connected with the P&W line in Callery. The Northern Subdivision ran from the junction to the village of Ribold outside of [[Butler, Pennsylvania|Butler]]. This new connection turned Callery into a major hub for the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&O Railroad]], and for the next three decades it would be called '''Callery Junction'''.

He was wed to Wan Sri Bini, daughter of the widowed Queen Parameswari Iskandar Shah of [[Bintan Island]] and received high honours comprising a golden crown studded with precious stones and a royal [[signet ring]] indicating his authority.<ref name=\"annals\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', the emporium of Singapore was founded in 1299 by Sang Nila Utama. While hunting on Bintan, he spotted a [[stag]] and started chasing it up a small hill but, when he reached the top, the stag vanished. He then came to a very large rock and decided to climb it. When he stood on top of the rock, he looked across the sea and saw another island with a white sandy beach which had the appearance of a white sheet of cloth. Asking his chief minister what island it was, he was told that it was the island of [[Temasek]] now known as [[Singapore]]. While his ship was out at sea, a great storm erupted and the ship was tossed about in the huge waves and began to take in water.  To prevent it from sinking, his men threw all the heavy things on board into the sea to lighten the ship. But still, water kept entering the ship. On the advice of the ship's captain, he threw his crown overboard as a gift to the sea. At once, the storm died down and he reached Temasek safely. <ref name=\"annals\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA43 |title=Malay Annals |pages=37\u201344 |author=Dr John Leyden and Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles|date=1821}</ref>\n\nHe landed safely on the beach and went hunting wild animals near the river mouth on a patch of open ground, now referred to as the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. Suddenly, he saw a strange animal with a red body, black head and a white breast, which swiftly disappeared into the jungle. Impressed by this beast's beauty, he asked his chief minister Demang Lebar Daun what animal it was and was informed that it was a [[lion]]. Pleased with this as he believed it to be a good omen, he decided to build his new city in Temasek.

He was wed to Wan Sri Bini, daughter of the widowed Queen Parameswari Iskandar Shah of [[Bintan Island]] and received high honours comprising a golden crown studded with precious stones and a royal [[signet ring]] indicating his authority.<ref name=\"annals\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', the emporium of Singapore was founded in 1299 by Sang Nila Utama. While hunting on Bintan, he spotted a [[stag]] and started chasing it up a small hill but, when he reached the top, the stag vanished. He then came to a very large rock and decided to climb it. When he stood on top of the rock, he looked across the sea and saw another island with a white sandy beach which had the appearance of a white sheet of cloth. Asking his chief minister what island it was, he was told that it was the island of [[Temasek]] now known as [[Singapore]] . While his ship was out at sea, a great storm erupted and the ship was tossed about in the huge waves and began to take in water.  To prevent it from sinking, his men threw all the heavy things on board into the sea to lighten the ship. But still water kept entering the ship. On the advice of the ship's captain, he threw his crown overboard as a gift to the sea. At once, the storm died down and he reached Temasek safely. <ref name=\"annals\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA43 |title=Malay Annals |pages=37\u201344 |author=Dr John Leyden and Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles|date=1821}}</ref>\n\nHe landed safely on the beach, and went to hunt wild animals near the river mouth on a patch of open ground, now referred to as the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. Suddenly, he saw a strange animal with a red body, black head and a white breast, which swiftly disappeared into the jungle. Impressed by this beast's beauty, he asked his chief minister Demang Lebar Daun what animal it was and was informed that it was a [[lion]]. Pleased with this as he believed it to be a good omen, he decided to build his new city in Temasek.

Co.'', 191 F. 579, 584\u201385, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911)</ref> Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the [[Natural and legal rights|right]] to ''exclude others''<ref name=\"Herman\"/> from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented [[invention]] for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]], which is usually 20 years from the filing date<ref name=PatentLength>Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]).</ref> subject to the payment of [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fees]]. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor \"a right to ''try'' to exclude by asserting the patent in court\", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.<ref name=\"lemley-2005\"/> A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, [[mortgage law|mortgaged]], assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.\n\nA patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.<ref name=\"Herman\"/> If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.\n\nSome countries have \"working provisions\" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.\n\n===Challenges===\n{{anchor|Invalid patent}}\nIn most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called [[opposition proceeding]]s.  It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not [[patentable subject matter]] at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to the [[person skilled in the art]], at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.  Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Roger Allan|title=Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=71\u2013128|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073705/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Arnold B.|title=Evaluating the Validity of a United States Patent|journal=JOM|date=1990|volume=42|issue=7|page=46|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|doi=10.1007/bf03221022|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823135108/http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|archivedate=2016-08-23|bibcode=1990JOM....42g..46S}}</ref>\n\n===Infringement===\n{{Main|Patent infringement}}\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the U.S.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallor|first1=Jane|title=BUSINESS LAW: THE ETHICAL, GLOBAL, AND E-COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352498-6|pages=266|edition=15th}}</ref>\n\n===Enforcement===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuits]] (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as [[France]] and [[Austria]]) have criminal penalties for [[wikt:wanton#Adjective|wanton]] infringement.<ref>{{cite web |author=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary |year=2005 |title=Patent Litigation across Europe |url=http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203134/http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-06 |publisher=cecollect.com |authorlink=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary }}</ref> Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an [[injunction]] that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the ''[[doctrine of equivalents]]'').\n\nAn accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a [[counterclaim]].  A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.  Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for [[patentability]] in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a [[Novelty (patent)|prior publication]], for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.  An example is the UK [[Certificate of contested validity]].\n\nPatent [[license|licensing agreements]] are [[contract]]s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.  It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under [[cross-licensing]] agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.\n\n===Ownership===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] to a corporate entity subsequently<ref>{{cite web | title=Assignee (Company) Name | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | work=Help Page | publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | accessdate=2007-07-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113345/http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | archivedate=2007-08-14 }}</ref> and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.<ref>See [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf Section 39 of the UK Patents Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004529/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }} as an example. The laws across Europe vary from country to country but are generally harmonised. In an Australian context, see ''University of Western Australia v Gray'' [2008] FCA 498 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2008/498.html AUSTLII]</ref>\n[[File:Ejector seat with patents cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The plate of the Martin [[Ejection seat|ejector seat]] of a military aircraft, stating that the product is covered by multiple patents in the UK, South Africa, Canada and pending in \"other\" jurisdictions. [[D\u00fcbendorf]] Museum of Military Aviation.]]\n\nThe inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).\n\nThe ability to assign ownership rights increases the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] of a patent as property.  Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm Article 28.2 TRIPs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622154724/https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm |date=2017-06-22 }}: \"''Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts.''\".</ref>  The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.\n\n===Governing laws===\n{{See also|Outline of patents}}\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.  Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.<ref>Staff, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#patent FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225083135/http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html |date=2013-02-25 }}</ref> A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes [[prior art]] and enters the [[public domain]] (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally<!--There might be grace periods in some countries (?)--> becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.\n\nCommonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a [[patent office]] with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts.\n\nThe authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.<ref>United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the [[Supremacy of Parliament]].</ref>  In the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to make laws to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts...\" The laws Congress passed are codified in [[Title 35 of the United States Code]] and created the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nThere is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) being particularly active in this area.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.  Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.  This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.\n\nInternationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) [constituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|ARIPO]] and [[Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle|OAPI]], the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states that have formed the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. A key international convention relating to patents is the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim [[priority right|priority]]: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.\n\n===Application and prosecution===\n{{Main|Patent application|Patent prosecution}}\nA patent is requested by filing a written [[Patent application|application]] at the relevant patent office.  The person or company filing the application is referred to as \"the applicant\". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide [[sufficiency of disclosure|sufficient detail]] for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the [[Sufficiency of disclosure|best mode]] of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.\n\nThe application also includes one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define what a patent covers or the \"scope of protection\".\n\nAfter filing, an application is often referred to as \"[[patent pending]]\".  While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|title=What does 'patent pending' mean?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829120240/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011}}</ref><ref>USPTO web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm ''Patent Marking and \"Patent Pending\"'' (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802035958/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}, Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref><ref>[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] web site, [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm ''Display your rights''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903125501/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm |date=2009-09-03 }}, (under \"IPO Home> Types of IP> Patents> Managing your patents> Using and enforcing\") Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref>\n\nOnce filed, a patent application is [[Patent prosecution|\"prosecuted\"]]. A [[patent examiner]] reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the [[patentability]] requirements of that country.  If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their [[patent attorney|patent agent or attorney]] through an [[Office action]], to which the applicant may respond.  The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.  In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an [[opposition proceeding]] between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.\n\nOnce granted the patent is subject in most countries to [[maintenance fee (patent)|renewal fees]] to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.  Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the [[European Patent Office]]) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.\n\n====Costs====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.\n\nThe European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.<ref>With the following assumptions: \"18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee\" (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf ''The cost of a sample European patent \u2013 new estimates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201548/http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}, 2005, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Since the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.\n\nIn the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent ([[patent prosecution]]) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.<ref name=\"lemley\">Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001).

This act coincided with the transformation of India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights the fact that the design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a developing country like India.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Nagesh|title=Intellectual Property Rights, Technology, and Economic Development: Experience of East Asian Countries|journal=RIS Discussion Paper|year=2002|volume=25}}</ref> This was possible because for many years prior to its membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), India did not recognize product patents for pharmaceuticals. Without product patents with which to contend, Indian pharmaceutical companies were able to churn out countless generic drugs, establishing India as one of the leading generic drug manufacturers in the world. Yet in 2005, because of its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), India was compelled to amend its laws to provide product patent protection to pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to satisfy the competing demands for inexpensive drugs and effective intellectual property protection, the Indian government created a law that afforded protection to pharmaceuticals only if they constituted brand new chemical substances or enhanced the therapeutic \u201cefficacy\u201d of known substances. This law, which is codified under section 3(d) of the Patents ([[Amendment]]) Act of 2005,7 has not sat well with some MNCs, including the Swiss company [[Novartis]]. Following the denial of a patent for its leukemia drug, Glivec, Novartis challenged the validity of section 3(d) under TRIPS and the Indian Constitution. The Indian Supreme Court ruled against Novartis in a decision that has, and will continue to have, broad implications for MNCs, the Indian pharmaceutical industry, and people around the world in need of affordable drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&context=law_globalstudies|website=openscholarship.wustl.edu|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{see also|Societal views on patents|United States Patent and Trademark Office#Criticisms}}\n<!--Please do not add new content here.

Similar grants included [[land patent]]s, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and [[printing patent]]s, a precursor of modern copyright.\n\nIn modern usage, the term ''patent'' usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents something new, useful and non-obvious.

It does not, directly or indirectly, imply any such right. It grants only the right to exclude others. The supposition that a right to make is created by the patent grant is obviously inconsistent with the established distinctions between generic and specific patents, and with the well-known fact that a very considerable portion of the patents granted are in a field covered by a former relatively generic or basic patent, are tributary to such earlier patent, and cannot be practiced unless by license thereunder.\" \u2013 ''Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co.'', 191 F. 579, 584\u201385, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911)</ref> Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the [[Natural and legal rights|right]] to ''exclude others''<ref name=\"Herman\"/> from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented [[invention]] for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]], which is usually 20 years from the filing date<ref name=PatentLength>Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]).</ref> subject to the payment of [[maintenance fee (patent)|maintenance fees]]. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor \"a right to ''try'' to exclude by asserting the patent in court\", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.<ref name=\"lemley-2005\"/> A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, [[mortgage law|mortgaged]], assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.\n\nA patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.<ref name=\"Herman\"/> If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.\n\nSome countries have \"working provisions\" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.\n\n===Challenges===\n{{anchor|Invalid patent}}\nIn most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called [[Opposition proceeding|opposition proceedings]].  It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not [[patentable subject matter]] at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to the [[person skilled in the art]], at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.  Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Roger Allan|title=Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=71\u2013128|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073705/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/11/99CLR71.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Arnold B.|title=Evaluating the Validity of a United States Patent|journal=JOM|date=1990|volume=42|issue=7|page=46|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|doi=10.1007/bf03221022|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823135108/http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9007.html|archivedate=2016-08-23|bibcode=1990JOM....42g..46S}}</ref>\n\n===Infringement===\n{{Main article|Patent infringement}}\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the U.S.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallor|first1=Jane|title=BUSINESS LAW: THE ETHICAL, GLOBAL, AND E-COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352498-6|pages=266|edition=15th}}</ref>\n\n===Enforcement===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuits]] (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as [[France]] and [[Austria]]) have criminal penalties for [[wikt:wanton#Adjective|wanton]] infringement.<ref>{{cite web |author=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary |year=2005 |title=Patent Litigation across Europe |url=http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203134/http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-06 |publisher=cecollect.com |authorlink=DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary }}</ref> Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an [[injunction]] that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the ''[[doctrine of equivalents]]'').\n\nAn accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a [[counterclaim]].  A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.  Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for [[patentability]] in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a [[Novelty (patent)|prior publication]], for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.  An example is the UK [[Certificate of contested validity]].\n\nPatent [[license|licensing agreements]] are [[contract]]s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.  It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under [[cross-licensing]] agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.\n\n===Ownership===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] to a corporate entity subsequently<ref>{{cite web | title=Assignee (Company) Name | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | work=Help Page | publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | accessdate=2007-07-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113345/http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20(Company)%20Name | archivedate=2007-08-14 }}</ref> and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.<ref>See [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf Section 39 of the UK Patents Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225004529/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }} as an example. The laws across Europe vary from country to country but are generally harmonised.

If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).\n\nThe ability to assign ownership rights increases the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] of a patent as property.  Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm Article 28.2 TRIPs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622154724/https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm |date=2017-06-22 }}: \"''Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts.''\".</ref>  The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.\n\n===Governing laws===\n{{See also|Outline of patents}}\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.  Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.<ref>Staff, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#patent FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225083135/http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html |date=2013-02-25 }}</ref> A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes [[prior art]] and enters the [[public domain]] (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally<!--There might be grace periods in some countries (?)--> becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.\n\nCommonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a [[patent office]] with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. \n\nThe authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.<ref>United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the [[Supremacy of Parliament]].</ref>  In the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to make laws to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts...\" The laws Congress passed are codified in [[Title 35 of the United States Code]] and created the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nThere is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) being particularly active in this area.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.  Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.  This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.\n\nInternationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) [constituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|ARIPO]] and [[Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle|OAPI]], the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states that have formed the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. A key international convention relating to patents is the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim [[priority right|priority]]: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.\n\n===Application and prosecution===\n{{Main article|Patent application|Patent prosecution}}\nA patent is requested by filing a written [[Patent application|application]] at the relevant patent office.  The person or company filing the application is referred to as \"the applicant\". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide [[sufficiency of disclosure|sufficient detail]] for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the [[Sufficiency of disclosure|best mode]] of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.\n\nThe application also includes one or more [[Patent claim|claims]] that define what a patent covers or the \"scope of protection\".\n\nAfter filing, an application is often referred to as \"[[patent pending]]\".  While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|title=What does 'patent pending' mean?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829120240/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/media/pages/whatis/patents.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011}}</ref><ref>USPTO web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm ''Patent Marking and \"Patent Pending\"'' (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802035958/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/patpend.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}, Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref><ref>[[UK Intellectual Property Office]] web site, [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm ''Display your rights''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903125501/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce/p-displayrights.htm |date=2009-09-03 }}, (under \"IPO Home> Types of IP> Patents> Managing your patents> Using and enforcing\") Consulted on August 5, 2009.</ref>\n\nOnce filed, a patent application is [[Patent prosecution|\"prosecuted\"]]. A [[patent examiner]] reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the [[patentability]] requirements of that country.  If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their [[patent attorney|patent agent or attorney]] through an [[Office action]], to which the applicant may respond.  The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.  In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an [[opposition proceeding]] between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.\n\nOnce granted the patent is subject in most countries to [[maintenance fee (patent)|renewal fees]] to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.  Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the [[European Patent Office]]) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.\n\n====Costs====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.\n\nThe European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.<ref>With the following assumptions: \"18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee\" (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf ''The cost of a sample European patent \u2013 new estimates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201548/http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}, 2005, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Since the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.\n\nIn the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent ([[patent prosecution]]) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.<ref name=\"lemley\">Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001).

A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.\n\nA [[trade secret]] is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]] and [[labour law]], each of which prevents information leaks such as [[Breach of confidence|breaches of confidentiality]] and [[industrial espionage]].

Without product patents with which to contend, Indian pharmaceutical companies were able to churn out countless generic drugs, establishing India as one of the leading generic drug manufacturers in the world. Yet in 2005, because of its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), India was compelled to amend its laws to provide product patent protection to pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to satisfy the competing demands for inexpensive drugs and effective intellectual property protection, the Indian government created a law that afforded protection to pharmaceuticals only if they constituted brand new chemical substances or enhanced the therapeutic \u201cefficacy\u201d of known substances. This law, which is codified under section 3(d) of the Patents ([[Amendment]]) Act of 2005,7 has not sat well with some MNCs, including the Swiss company [[Novartis]]. Following the denial of a patent for its leukemia drug, Glivec, Novartis challenged the validity of section 3(d) under TRIPS and the Indian Constitution.

The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered [[rail trail]] called [[Columbia Trail]], which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]].\n\nThough the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. It was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor's enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the [[California Gold Rush]] broke out. The Borough was incorporated by an act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] from portions of both [[Lebanon Township, New Jersey|Lebanon]] and [[Tewksbury Township, New Jersey|Tewksbury]] Townships on April 2, 1918.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from [[Dunellen, New Jersey|Dunellen]], but the background paint wasn't dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, \"Califon\" was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage.\n\nCalifon is situated just north of the [[Ken Lockwood Gorge]] on the [[South Branch Raritan River|South Branch of the Raritan River]]; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen.\n\nThe '''Califon Historic District''' is a {{convert|164|acre|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.  It included 154 [[contributing buildings]], three [[contributing structures]], and one [[contributing site]],<ref name=nris/> created through the efforts of the Califon Historical Society. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers.\n\nThe center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough.<ref>[[Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER) No. NJ-56, \"[http://loc.gov/pictures/item/nj1006/ Califon Bridge],\" 1986.</ref> Recently the State of New Jersey announced that the bridge would be replaced because a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).\n\nThe 1943 short story, \"[[The Greatest Gift]],\" was set in a town inspired by Califon and adapted into the 1946 classic film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]].'' Author [[Philip Van Doren Stern]] said in a 1946 interview, \"Incidentally, the movie takes place in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].  Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J.\"  The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] considered jumping from in the movie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heyboer|first1=Kelly|title=It's New Jersey's wonderful story|work=The Star-Ledger|date=December 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCalifon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by [[Merv Griffin]] on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart.

The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered [[rail trail]] called [[Columbia Trail]], which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]].\n\nThough the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. It was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor's enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the [[California Gold Rush]] broke out. The Borough was incorporated by an act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] from portions of both [[Lebanon Township, New Jersey|Lebanon]] and [[Tewksbury Township, New Jersey|Tewksbury]] Townships on April 2, 1918.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from [[Dunellen, New Jersey|Dunellen]], but the background paint wasn't dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, \"Califon\" was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage.\n\nCalifon is situated just north of the [[Ken Lockwood Gorge]] on the [[South Branch Raritan River|South Branch of the Raritan River]]; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen.\n\nThe '''Califon Historic District''' is a {{convert|164|acre|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.  It included 154 [[contributing buildings]], three [[contributing structures]], and one [[contributing site]],<ref name=nris/> created through the efforts of the Califon Historical Society. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers.\n\nThe center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough.<ref>[[Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER) No. NJ-56, \"[http://loc.gov/pictures/item/nj1006/ Califon Bridge],\" 1986.</ref> Recently the State of New Jersey announced that the bridge would be replaced because a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).\n\nThe 1943 short story, \"[[The Greatest Gift]],\" was set in a town inspired by Califon and adapted into the 1946 classic film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]].'' Author [[Philip Van Doren Stern]] said in a 1946 interview, \"Incidentally, the movie takes place in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].  Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J.\"  The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] considered jumping from in the movie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heyboer|first1=Kelly|title=It's New Jersey's wonderful story|work=The Star-Ledger|date=December 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCalifon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by [[Merv Griffin]] on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart.

This cave is believed to be in present-day [[China]].\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day [[Myanmar]].\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is won't to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of (from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from Tibet to Central China, hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations. For all his contributions, the villagers repay him with a tin of paddy each annually. It is hard to limit or detail the exact status and role of the Tangsam as he, literally, is the errand boy of the village who delivers as demanded.\n\n====Thiempu (priest)====\nA conspicuous facet of the primitive Gangte polity is the role played by the village priest, who is also the doctor of the village. Natively known as Thiempu, his status and role is a standout for the fact that there are certain areas of jurisdiction where his decision is the law. Given a situation, priesthood is the only office that can challenge and curb the tyranny of the Chief. However, for all its might and main, priesthood is considered hereditary, certain factors engendering its ascribed-ness. The nuances of healing and enigma of medicine are well-kept secrets, finely hidden from the knowledge of the public. The passage of tricks of the trade is only between the priest and his sons or grandsons. Moreover, one has to spend considerable amount to learn the secrets of healing and this discourage most of the villagers. Rev. Gangte has suggested that under some situations, the priest is considered as the head of the village. His role is more pronounced than that of the chief vis-a-vis festivity and religion.\n\nAs the keeper of the health of the masses, the sickly are referred to the priest who is expected to identify the cause of the illness. The spirit of the age has it that all ailments are the handiwork of evil-spirit, and the priest is expected to cast it out. Patients are treated by the priest with indigenous herbs and magical invocations. So long as the incantation or spell is not revoke from the patients, they are not allowed to socialise with the rest of the society. The priest does not charge any consultation fee from the villagers. But the villagers pay for his service by doling out a tribute in the form of paddy or other items. The priest also conducts divine sessions with the spirit and prays for productivity of the land. Hunters returning from a successful safari are welcome by the priest at the Khawmuol with drums and chants for which the priest is entitled with a bulk of the meat of the hunted.\n\nOne captivating aspect of priesthood concerns the priest unquestionable power to restrict entry to the village. The priest, when circumstances demanded- that often are tribal wars and plague, would hang a branch of tree (Theubawk) at the Khawmuol to signal that sojourners and strangers are not permitted to enter the village. This ban applies even to the next of kin of the priest if they reside in another village. Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith. In appreciation of his deeds, the villagers return the favour in the form of a tin of paddy per household annually. Should any villager be successful in their hunts, they are bonded by custom to gift a chunk of the catch to the blacksmith as Thiksek-sa.\n\n====Suok (slaves)====\nChroniclers like John Shakepeare were the first to highlight the existence of slavery in the CHIKIM society. In his work The Lushai Kuki Clans (1912), he put forth a detailed view on tribal slavery. On the whole, slavery among the tribals vastly differs from that of the West or New World. Tribal slavery is not under duress, it's almost voluntary. Close observation gives the impression that in most cases, slavery seemed the only option for survival. Among the Gangtes three variants of slavery were practiced:\n*'''Inpi Suok''': This refers to the first type of slaves under the chief who is the only one accredited to own slaves. Inpi Suok are mostly orphans, the incapacitated who cannot look after themselves and the poor in abject misery. The Inpi Suok are conventionally treated as members of the Chief's family but they must work and toil harder than genuine members. The chief, being their guardian, is fully responsible for the welfare and security of the Inpi Suok.\n*'''Chemsan Suok''': Rough translation would be \u2018slaves due to stained sword\u2019. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of slaves in the Chief's house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they give in to the chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief's chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes insolvents who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok's daughter.\n\n:L.B. Thanga (the Mizos, 1979) says that till 1928, Chemsan Suok can buy freedom by compensating the Chief, his master, with a mithun or forty rupees in cash.\n*'''Tuklut Suok''': Tuklut Suok are slaves as a consequence of village wars and they usually belong to the losing side in the battle. For safety, the losing party give themselves to the victorious one and hence, the label Tuklut, meaning \u2018give in\u2019. Tuklut Suok can build shelter in the victorious village as and when they can handover a healthy mithun to the Chief and if the Tuklut Suok are of small family, even a mithun can buy their freedom.\n\n==Christianization and the new socio-political structure==\n#The Church:\nWith the advent of Christianity in the late 19th century among the Lushais of Mizoram and its subsequent infiltration to the southern parts of Manipur spreading among the Thadous, Hmars, Vaiphei, Gangtes in the early 20th century, the traditional mode of education was soon replaced by the Church. Presently, ESC (Evangelical Synod Church) under ECCI and GBA (Gangte Baptist Church) are the predominant churches.\n\n*Organizations:\n\n#Gangte Tribes Union (GTU) is the apex body of the Gangte people.\n\nBesides, there are numerous organisations among the Gangtes. Wherever there is a Gangte, a certain form of Organisation is established to interact, provide help, communicate and bond the Gangte people.\n\n2. Gangte  Youths Organisation (GYO) is a philanthropic organisation working for and helping the needy, destitute and distressed and also working for the welfare of the people.\n\n3. Gangte  Students Organisation (GSO) is an apex students body of the Gangte people. The GSO work for the welfare of the students and learners  either academic or any arts or displine or field of study.\n\n4. Gangte Literature Society (GLS) is a body working for the preservation, promotion and upholding the  Gangte language.\n\n5. Gangte Culture and Custom Society is work for the preserving and promoting the culture, tradition and custom of the Gangte.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#Education:\nThe Gangtes are one of the most educated and brilliant among the Chin-Kuki-Mizo community. 99% of the population are literate, all persons are well educated and mannered and are mostly fully employed.\n\nThe Gangtes are very well developed. Among the history of the world, India, Burma and Bangladesh: the Chin-Kuki-Mizo in particular, they have set a number of records.\n\nOf those records, mention may be of Dr. Tongngul Gangte who among the tribal people of Manipur was the first person to pass HSLC EXAM (Class X) in 1924.\n\n==Present-day==\nAs in ancient Gangte, the Present day Gangtes are very honorable. They predominantly live in and around Churachandpur town (Manipur). They are also well known in History, Politics, Education, Arts and Science.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103302/http://ganggam.org/ Ganggam.Org]\n* [http://smsgupshup.com/groups/ganggamnews GanggamNews]\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gnb Ethnologue]\n\n{{Kuki-Chin-Mizo tribes}}\n{{Hill tribes of Northeast India}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Manipur]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Manipur]]\n[[Category:Social groups of Assam]]\n[[Category:Kuki tribes]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Assam]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=November 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group            = Gangte\n| population       = 40,000 (approx) worldwide\n| total_ref        = <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/ST.html|title=A-11 Individual Scheduled Tribe Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix|publisher=Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n| regions          = [[Northeast India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]]\n| languages        = [[Gangte language]]\n| religions        = [[Christianity]]\n| related          = [[Chin people|Chin]] {{\u00b7}} [[Thadou people|Thadou]] {{\u00b7}}[[Hmar people|Hmar]] {{\u00b7}} [[Mizo people|Mizo]] {{\u00b7}} [[Simte people|Simte]] {{\u00b7}} [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]] {{\u00b7}} [[Zou people|Zou]] {{\u00b7}} [[Paite people|Paite]]\n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n}}\n\n'''Gangte''' is an indigenous and recognised tribe of [[Manipur]], [[India]].

This cave is believed to be in present-day China.\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day Myanmar.\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is wont to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of(from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from Tibet to Central China, hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations.

Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith.

She had arrived in Chiapa de Corzo with her son and a large number of servants because she wanted to consult a famed Indian healer and went to visit him. \"Clear the way for my lady Mar\u00eda de Angulo!\" shouted her servants.

After this calamity, an epidemic broke out that killed almost half of its population. Amidst this misery, there arrived at Chiapa de Corzo a mule train loaded with large stores of corn, beans, vegetables, and money. The people could not believe it until they heard again the voices of the servants: \"Clear the way for my lady Mar\u00eda de Angulo!\"\n\nThe servants distributed the food to the families, and during the nights the servants and danced and danced for the amusement of the children. They also threw candy to them and warned their parents, \"Remember your children, the gifts are for the children!\" All this was done in memory of the son of Mar\u00eda de Angulo, or \"para el chico.\" Thus the tradition of the Parachicos was born. Each year, the city celebrates this event with a woman dressed as Se\u00f1ora Maria de Angulo, who travels aboard an allegorical car, throwing gold coins, sweets, and confetti.\n\nOn certain nights during the festival, the town's men dress as Spanish women and parade through the streets.
