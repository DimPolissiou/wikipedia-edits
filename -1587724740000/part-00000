The player flies an antiquated spacecraft (the last of the fictional F-27 Platypus fleet) and attempts to defend the peaceful country of Mungola from neighboring Colossatropolis, which has become so overcrowded that its inhabitants are taking over Mungola for space and resources. The game consists of four levels, with five areas per level and a strong boss enemy that must be defeated at the end of the fifth area. The player can collect power-ups that affect the type and firing rate of the ship's weapons, equip auxiliary cannons, or activate defensive shields.\n\nPoints are scored for destroying enemies and collecting bonus items. In addition, at the end of each area, the player receives bonus points depending on the percentage of primary targets and enemy craft destroyed.\n\n==Claymation==\nAll the artwork for the game was created using a process called [[Claymation]]. Flack has stated that due to limited availability of [[Plasticine]] in his home country of New Zealand at the time the game was created, he re-used the same lump of grey clay to create all the models, photographed them with a digital camera, and coloured the images in [[Adobe Photoshop]].\n\n==Releases==\nPlatypus was first released on CD in May 2002.
