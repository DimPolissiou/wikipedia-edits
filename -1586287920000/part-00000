He was born in [[Le Claire, Iowa|Le Claire]], [[Iowa Territory]] (now the U.S. state of [[Iowa]]), but he lived for several years in his father's hometown in [[Toronto Township, Ontario]], Canada, before the family returned to the [[Midwest]] and settled in the [[Kansas Territory]].\n\nBuffalo Bill started working at the age of eleven, after his father's death, and became a rider for the [[Pony Express]] at age 15. During the [[American Civil War]], he served the Union from 1863 to the end of the war in 1865. Later he served as a civilian scout for the [[US Army]] during the [[Indian Wars]], receiving the [[Medal of Honor]] in 1872.\n\nOne of the most famous and well-known figures of the [[American Old West]], Buffalo Bill's legend began to spread when he was only 23.  Shortly thereafter he started performing in [[Wild West show|shows]] that displayed [[cowboy]] themes and episodes from the frontier and Indian Wars. He founded ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' in 1883, taking his large company on tours in the United States and, beginning in 1887, in Great Britain and continental Europe.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCody was born on February 26, 1846, on a farm just outside [[Le Claire, Iowa]].<ref name=\"scottcountyiowa.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottcountyiowa.com/conservation/buffalobill_history.php |title=Scott County Conservation Department |publisher=Scottcountyiowa.com |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730145943/http://www.scottcountyiowa.com/conservation/buffalobill_history.php |archivedate=July 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His father, Isaac Cody, was born on September 5, 1811, in [[Toronto Township, Ontario|Toronto Township]], [[Upper Canada]], now part of [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], directly west of [[Toronto]].

Isaac Cody was against slavery. He was invited to speak at Rively's store, a local trading post where pro-slavery men often held meetings. His [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] speech so angered the crowd that they threatened to kill him if he didn't step down. A man jumped up and stabbed him twice with a [[Bowie knife]]. Rively, the store's owner, rushed Cody to get treatment, but he never fully recovered from his injuries.\n\nIn Kansas, the family was frequently persecuted by pro-slavery supporters. Cody's father spent time away from home for his safety. His enemies learned of a planned visit to his family and plotted to kill him on the way. Bill, despite his youth and being ill at the time, rode <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">30&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(48&nbsp;km)</span> to warn his father. Isaac Cody went to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], to organize a group of thirty families to bring back to Kansas, in order to add to the antislavery population. During his return trip he caught a respiratory infection which, compounded by the lingering effects of his stabbing and complications from kidney disease, led to his death in April 1857.<ref name=\"Cody1\">{{cite book | last = Cody| first = William F.| title =The Life of Hon.

At age 11, Bill took a job with a freight carrier as a \"boy extra\". On horseback he would ride up and down the length of a wagon train and deliver messages between the drivers and workmen. Next he joined [[Utah War|Johnston's Army]] as an unofficial member of the scouts assigned to guide the United States Army to [[Utah]], to put down a rumored rebellion by the [[Mormon]] population of [[Salt Lake City]].<ref name=\"Carter1\" />\n\nAccording to Cody's account in ''Buffalo Bill's Own Story'', the [[Utah War]] was where he began his career as an \"Indian fighter\":\n\n<blockquote>Presently the moon rose, dead ahead of me; and painted boldly across its face was the figure of an Indian. He wore this war-bonnet of the [[Sioux]], at his shoulder was a rifle pointed at someone in the river-bottom 30 feet [9 meters] below; in another second he would drop one of my friends. I raised my old muzzle-loader and fired. The figure collapsed, tumbled down the bank and landed with a splash in the water. 'What is it?' called McCarthy, as he hurried back. 'It's over there in the water.' 'Hi!' he cried. 'Little Billy's killed an Indian all by himself!'

Cody enlisted as a scout himself at [[Fort Ellsworth (Kansas)|Fort Elsworth]] and scouted between there and Fort Fletcher (later renamed and moved to [[Fort Hays]]). He was attached as a scout, variously, to [[George Augustus Armes|Captain George Augustus Armes]] ([[Battle of the Saline River]]) and [[George Armstrong Custer|Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer]] (guide and impromptu horse race to [[Fort Larned]]).

It was revoked in 1917, along with medals of 910 other recipients, when Congress authorized the War Department to revoke prior Army Medal of Honor awards it had considered dubious since the introduction of strict regulations in 1897. All civilian medals were revoked, including civilian scouts, since they did not meet the basic criterion of being officers or enlisted soldiers, which had been expressly listed in every authorizing statute ever enacted. Cody was one of five scouts affected. Their medals were stripped shortly after Cody died in 1917.\n\nCody's relatives objected, and over a number of years they wrote repeatedly to Congress seeking reconsideration. All efforts failed, including a 1988 letter to the US Senate from Cody's grandson, until the office of [[Alan K. Simpson|Senator Alan K. Simpson]] of Wyoming took up the cause in 1989. Its brief, which argued for the retroactive elevation of these civilian scouts' status to meet the Medal's standards, persuaded the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to restore their medals. The decision was controversial for a number of reasons. Senator Simpson's submission argued that the law had never required Cody to be a soldier, which was untrue, as every version of the law had required this. Simpson's submission cited a book, Above and Beyond, to illustrate this point, but the source actually listed the correct law that required Cody to be an enlisted soldier. Another problem was the questionable authority of the Board for Correction to contravene several federal statutes; the Medal of Honor revocation had been expressly authorized by Congress, meaning that the restoration went against the law in force in 1872, the law requiring the revocation in 1916, and the modern statute enacted in 1918 that remains substantially unmodified today. Since the Board of Correction is merely a delegation of the Secretary of the Army's authority, this raises a separation of powers conflict, since even the president cannot contravene a clear statute, yet Cody's medal was dealt with below the cabinet level. Modern Medal of Honor cases originating from the board, such as the recent case of Garlin Conner, required both executive action as well as a statutory waiver from Congress, which underscores this point. In the Cody case, the board's governing assistant secretary recognized that it lacked the authority to reinstate the medal directly, and so decided to return the case to the board for reconsideration. As a result, the board amended Cody's record to make him an enlisted soldier so that he would fall within the legal requirements, and did the same for four other civilian guides who had also had their medals rescinded. In doing so, the board overlooked the fact that Cody was a civilian guide with far greater employment flexibility than a soldier, including the ability to resign at will.<ref>Dwight Mears, The Medal of Honor: The Evolution of America's Highest Military Decoration (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas), 174-180, 192</ref>\n\n== Nickname ==\n[[File:Buffalo Bill Cody by Sarony, c1880.jpg|thumb|\"Buffalo Bill,\" nicknamed after his contract to supply [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] workers with [[American bison|buffalo]] meat]]\n\nCody received the nickname \"Buffalo Bill\" after the American Civil War, when he had a contract to supply [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] workers with [[American bison|buffalo]] ''(American bison)'' meat.<ref>Crossen, Forest (1968).

Today the [[Old Trail Town]] museum is at the center of the community and commemorates the traditions of Western life. Cody first passed through the region in the 1870s. He was so impressed by the development possibilities from irrigation, rich soil, grand scenery, hunting, and proximity to [[Yellowstone Park]] that he returned in the mid-1890s to start a town. Streets in the town were named after his associates: Beck, Alger, Rumsey, Bleistein and Salsbury. The town was incorporated in 1901.\n\nIn November 1902, Cody opened the [[Irma Hotel]], named after his daughter. He envisioned a growing number of tourists coming to Cody on the recently opened Burlington rail line. He expected that they would proceed up Cody Road, along the north fork of the Shoshone River, to visit Yellowstone Park. To accommodate travelers, Cody completed construction of the Wapiti Inn and [[Pahaska Tepee]] in 1905 along Cody Road<ref>[[Kensel, W. Hudson]] (1987). ''Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill's Old Hunting Lodge and Hotel, A History, 1901\u20131946''. Buffalo Bill Historical Center.</ref> with the assistance of the artist and rancher [[Abraham Archibald Anderson]].\n\nCody established the [[T E Ranch Headquarters|TE Ranch]], located on the south fork of the Shoshone River about thirty-five miles from Cody. When he acquired the TE property, he stocked it with cattle sent from Nebraska and South Dakota. The new herd carried the TE brand. The late 1890s were relatively prosperous years for the ''Wild West'' show, and he bought more land to add to the ranch. He eventually held around 8,000 acres (32&nbsp;km\u00b2) of private land for grazing operations and ran about 1,000 head of cattle. He operated a [[dude ranch]], pack-horse camping trips, and big-game hunting business at and from the TE Ranch. In his spacious ranch house, he entertained notable guests from Europe and America.\n\nCody published his autobiography, ''The Life and Adventures of Buffalo Bill'', in 1879.<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders].</ref> Another autobiography, ''The Great West That Was: \"Buffalo Bill's\" Life Story'', was serialized in ''Hearst's International Magazine'' from August 1916 to July 1917.<ref name=LLBB>Don Russell, ''The Lives and Legends of Buffalo Bill'', 1979.</ref> and ghostwritten by [[James J. Montague]].<ref>Richard H. Montague, ''Memory Street'', 1962.</ref> It contained a number of errors, in part because it was completed after Cody's death in January 1917.<ref name=LLBB />\n\n=== Irrigation ===\n[[Larry McMurtry]], along with historians such as R.L. Wilson, asserted that at the turn of the 20th century, Cody was the most recognizable celebrity on Earth.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> While Cody's show brought appreciation for the Western and American Indian cultures, he saw the [[American West]] change dramatically during his life. Bison herds, which had once numbered in the millions, were threatened with extinction. Railroads crossed the plains, [[barbed wire]] and other types of fences divided the land for farmers and ranchers, and the once-threatening Indian tribes were confined to reservations. [[Wyoming]]'s coal, [[Petroleum|oil]] and natural gas were beginning to be exploited toward the end of his life.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\nThe [[Shoshone River]] was dammed for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]]. In 1897 and 1899 Cody and his associates acquired from the State of Wyoming the right to take water from the Shoshone River to irrigate about {{convert|169000|acre|km2|-1|abbr=on}} of land in the [[Big Horn Basin]]. They began developing a canal to carry water diverted from the river, but their plans did not include a water storage reservoir. Cody and his associates were unable to raise sufficient capital to complete their plan. Early in 1903 they joined with the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners in urging the federal government to step in and help with irrigation in the valley.\n\nThe Shoshone Project became one of the first federal water development projects undertaken by the newly formed Reclamation Service, later known as the [[Bureau of Reclamation]]. After Reclamation took over the project in 1903, investigating engineers recommended constructing a dam on the Shoshone River in the canyon west of Cody. Construction of the Shoshone Dam started in 1905, a year after the Shoshone Project was authorized. When it was completed in 1910, it was the tallest dam in the world. Almost three decades after its construction, the name of the dam and reservoir was changed to [[Buffalo Bill Dam]] by an act of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbdvc.com/Buffalo_Bill_Dam_History.php|title=Buffalo Bill Dam History|accessdate=March 7, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110707214856/http://www.bbdvc.com/Buffalo_Bill_Dam_History.php|archive-date=July 7, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage ==\nCody married [[Louisa Frederici]] on March 6, 1866, just a few days after his twentieth birthday.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Buffalo Bill's Wild West: Celebrity, Memory, and Popular History|last=Kasson|first=Joy|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2000|isbn=0-8090-3244-9|location=New York|page=139}}</ref> The couple met when Cody had traveled to [[St. Louis]] under his command during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Cody's ''Autobiography'' barely mentioned the courtship to Frederici but declared, \"I now adored her above any other young lady I had ever seen.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Cody suggested in letters and in his autobiography that Frederici had pestered him into marriage, but he was aware that it was \"very smart to be engaged.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> This rhetoric became pushed more and more in his explanations for marriage as the relationship between him and his wife began to decline.\n\nFrederici stayed home with their four children in North Platte, while he stayed outside the home, hunting, scouting, and building up his acting career in the ''[[Wild West shows|Wild West]]'' show.<ref name=\":0\" /> As Cody began to travel more frequently and to places farther from home, problems over infidelity, real or imagined, began to arise. These concerns grew so great that in 1893, Frederici showed up at his hotel room in [[Chicago]] unannounced and was led to \"Mr. and Mrs. Cody's suite.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Cody mentions in his [[autobiography]] that he was \"embarrassed by the throng of beautiful ladies\" who surrounded him both in the cast and in the audiences, and this trend continued as he became involved with more and more actresses who were not afraid to show their attraction to him in front of an audience.<ref name=\"Cody1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Buffalo Bill's Divorce Announcement.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from a newspaper in Erie, Colorado, reporting Cody's filing for divorce]]\n\nCody filed for [[divorce]] in 1904, after 38 years of marriage.<ref name=\":0\" /> This decision was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between his wife and his sisters, and friction between the children and their father.

When the trial proceeded a year later, in 1905, both their tempers were still hot. The final ruling was that \"incompatibility was not grounds for divorce,\" so that the couple was to stay legally married.<ref name=\":1\" /> The judge and the public sided with Frederici, the judge deciding that her husband's alleged affairs and his sisters' meddling in his marriage had caused his unhappiness, not his wife.

Isaac Cody was against slavery. He was invited to speak at Rively's store, a local trading post where pro-slavery men often held meetings. His [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] speech so angered the crowd that they threatened to kill him if he didn't step down. A man jumped up and stabbed him twice with a [[Bowie knife]]. Rively, the store's owner, rushed Cody to get treatment, but he never fully recovered from his injuries.\n\nIn Kansas, the family was frequently persecuted by pro-slavery supporters.

It was revoked in 1917, along with medals of 910 other recipients, when Congress authorized the War Department to revoke prior Army Medal of Honor awards it had considered dubious since the introduction of strict regulations in 1897. All civilian medals were revoked, including civilian scouts, since they did not meet the basic criterion of being officers or enlisted soldiers, which had been expressly listed in every authorizing statute ever enacted. Cody was one of five scouts affected. Their medals were stripped shortly after Cody died in 1917.\n\nCody's relatives objected, and over a number of years they wrote repeatedly to Congress seeking reconsideration. All efforts failed, including a 1988 letter to the US Senate from Cody's grandson, until the office of [[Alan K. Simpson|Senator Alan K. Simpson]] of Wyoming took up the cause in 1989. Its brief, which argued for the retroactive elevation of these civilian scouts' status to meet the Medal's standards, persuaded the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to restore their medals. The decision was controversial for a number of reasons. Senator Simpson's submission argued that the law had never required Cody to be a soldier, which was untrue, as every version of the law had required this. Simpson's submission cited a book, Above and Beyond, to illustrate this point, but the source actually listed the correct law that required Cody to be an enlisted soldier. Another problem was the questionable authority of the Board for Correction to contravene several federal statutes; the Medal of Honor revocation had been expressly authorized by Congress, meaning that the restoration went against the law in force in 1872, the law requiring the revocation in 1916, and the modern statute enacted in 1918 that remains substantially unmodified today. Since the Board of Correction is merely a delegation of the Secretary of the Army's authority, this raises a separation of powers conflict, since even the president cannot contravene a clear statute, yet Cody's medal was dealt with below the cabinet level. Modern Medal of Honor cases originating from the board, such as the recent case of Garlin Conner, required both executive action as well as a statutory waiver from Congress, which underscores this point. In the Cody case, the board's governing assistant secretary recognized that it lacked the authority to reinstate the medal directly, and so decided to return the case to the board for reconsideration. As a result, the board amended Cody's record to make him an enlisted soldier so that he would fall within the legal requirements, and did the same for four other civilian guides who had also had their medals rescinded. In doing so, the board overlooked the fact that Cody was a civilian guide with far greater employment flexibility than a soldier, including the ability to resign at will.<ref>Dwight Mears, The Medal of Honor: The Evolution of America's Highest Military Decoration (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas), 174-180, 192</ref>\n\n== Nickname ==\n[[File:Buffalo Bill Cody by Sarony, c1880.jpg|thumb|\"Buffalo Bill,\" nicknamed after his contract to supply [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] workers with [[American bison|buffalo]] meat]]\n\nCody received the nickname \"Buffalo Bill\" after the American Civil War, when he had a contract to supply [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] workers with [[American bison|buffalo]] ''(American bison)'' meat.<ref>Crossen, Forest (1968).

Royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and the future [[King George V]].<ref>Russell, ''The Lives and Legends of Buffalo Bill'', pp. 330\u2013331.</ref> These royal encounters provided ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' an endorsement and publicity that ensured its success. Also, at this time, Buffalo Bill was presented with written accolades from several of America's high ranking generals including [[William T. Sherman]], [[Philip H. Sheridan]] and [[William H. Emory]] testifying to his service, bravery and character. Among the presentations was a document signed by [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[John M.

Today the [[Old Trail Town]] museum is at the center of the community and commemorates the traditions of Western life. Cody first passed through the region in the 1870s. He was so impressed by the development possibilities from irrigation, rich soil, grand scenery, hunting, and proximity to [[Yellowstone Park]] that he returned in the mid-1890s to start a town. Streets in the town were named after his associates: Beck, Alger, Rumsey, Bleistein and Salsbury. The town was incorporated in 1901.\n\nIn November 1902, Cody opened the [[Irma Hotel]], named after his daughter. He envisioned a growing number of tourists coming to Cody on the recently opened Burlington rail line. He expected that they would proceed up Cody Road, along the north fork of the Shoshone River, to visit Yellowstone Park. To accommodate travelers, Cody completed construction of the Wapiti Inn and [[Pahaska Tepee]] in 1905 along Cody Road<ref>[[Kensel, W. Hudson]] (1987). ''Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill's Old Hunting Lodge and Hotel, A History, 1901\u20131946''. Buffalo Bill Historical Center.</ref> with the assistance of the artist and rancher [[Abraham Archibald Anderson]].\n\nCody established the [[T E Ranch Headquarters|TE Ranch]], located on the south fork of the Shoshone River about thirty-five miles from Cody. When he acquired the TE property, he stocked it with cattle sent from Nebraska and South Dakota. The new herd carried the TE brand. The late 1890s were relatively prosperous years for the ''Wild West'' show, and he bought more land to add to the ranch. He eventually held around 8,000 acres (32&nbsp;km\u00b2) of private land for grazing operations and ran about 1,000 head of cattle. He operated a [[dude ranch]], pack-horse camping trips, and big-game hunting business at and from the TE Ranch. In his spacious ranch house, he entertained notable guests from Europe and America.\n\nCody published his autobiography, ''The Life and Adventures of Buffalo Bill'', in 1879.<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders].</ref> Another autobiography, ''The Great West That Was: \"Buffalo Bill's\" Life Story'', was serialized in ''Hearst's International Magazine'' from August 1916 to July 1917.<ref name=LLBB>Don Russell, ''The Lives and Legends of Buffalo Bill'', 1979.</ref> and ghostwritten by [[James J. Montague]].<ref>Richard H. Montague, ''Memory Street'', 1962.</ref> It contained a number of errors, in part because it was completed after Cody's death in January 1917.<ref name=LLBB />\n\n=== Irrigation ===\n[[Larry McMurtry]], along with historians such as R.L. Wilson, asserted that at the turn of the 20th century, Cody was the most recognizable celebrity on Earth.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> While Cody's show brought appreciation for the Western and American Indian cultures, he saw the [[American West]] change dramatically during his life. Bison herds, which had once numbered in the millions, were threatened with extinction. Railroads crossed the plains, [[barbed wire]] and other types of fences divided the land for farmers and ranchers, and the once-threatening Indian tribes were confined to reservations. [[Wyoming]]'s coal, [[Petroleum|oil]] and natural gas were beginning to be exploited toward the end of his life.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\nThe [[Shoshone River]] was dammed for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]]. In 1897 and 1899 Cody and his associates acquired from the State of Wyoming the right to take water from the Shoshone River to irrigate about {{convert|169000|acre|km2|-1|abbr=on}} of land in the [[Big Horn Basin]]. They began developing a canal to carry water diverted from the river, but their plans did not include a water storage reservoir. Cody and his associates were unable to raise sufficient capital to complete their plan. Early in 1903 they joined with the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners in urging the federal government to step in and help with irrigation in the valley.\n\nThe Shoshone Project became one of the first federal water development projects undertaken by the newly formed Reclamation Service, later known as the [[Bureau of Reclamation]]. After Reclamation took over the project in 1903, investigating engineers recommended constructing a dam on the Shoshone River in the canyon west of Cody. Construction of the Shoshone Dam started in 1905, a year after the Shoshone Project was authorized. When it was completed in 1910, it was the tallest dam in the world. Almost three decades after its construction, the name of the dam and reservoir was changed to [[Buffalo Bill Dam]] by an act of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbdvc.com/Buffalo_Bill_Dam_History.php|title=Buffalo Bill Dam History|accessdate=March 7, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110707214856/http://www.bbdvc.com/Buffalo_Bill_Dam_History.php|archive-date=July 7, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage ==\nCody married [[Louisa Frederici]] on March 6, 1866, just a few days after his twentieth birthday.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Buffalo Bill's Wild West: Celebrity, Memory, and Popular History|last=Kasson|first=Joy|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2000|isbn=0-8090-3244-9|location=New York|page=139}}</ref> The couple met when Cody had traveled to [[St. Louis]] under his command during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Cody's ''Autobiography'' barely mentioned the courtship to Frederici but declared, \"I now adored her above any other young lady I had ever seen.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Cody suggested in letters and in his autobiography that Frederici had pestered him into marriage, but he was aware that it was \"very smart to be engaged.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> This rhetoric became pushed more and more in his explanations for marriage as the relationship between him and his wife began to decline.\n\nFrederici stayed home with their four children in North Platte, while he stayed outside the home, hunting, scouting, and building up his acting career in the ''[[Wild West shows|Wild West]]'' show.<ref name=\":0\" /> As Cody began to travel more frequently and to places farther from home, problems over infidelity, real or imagined, began to arise. These concerns grew so great that in 1893, Frederici showed up at his hotel room in [[Chicago]] unannounced and was led to \"Mr. and Mrs. Cody's suite.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Cody mentions in his [[autobiography]] that he was \"embarrassed by the throng of beautiful ladies\" who surrounded him both in the cast and in the audiences, and this trend continued as he became involved with more and more actresses who were not afraid to show their attraction to him in front of an audience.<ref name=\"Cody1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Buffalo Bill's Divorce Announcement.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from a newspaper in Erie, Colorado, reporting Cody's filing for divorce]]\n\nCody filed for [[divorce]] in 1904, after 38 years of marriage.<ref name=\":0\" /> This decision was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between his wife and his sisters, and friction between the children and their father. By 1891, Cody had instructed his brother-in-law to handle Frederici's affairs and property, stating \"I often feel sorry for her. She is a strange woman but I don't mind her\u2014remember she is my wife\u2014and let it go at that. If she gets cranky, just laugh at it, she can't help it.\"<ref>W. F. Cody to Al Goodman, Aug. 25, 1891, in Foote, ed., ''Letters from Buffalo Bill'', p. 69.</ref> Cody hoped to keep the divorce quiet, so as to not disrupt his show or his stage persona, but Frederici had other ideas.\n\nFiling for divorce was scandalous in the early 20th century, when marital unions were seen as binding for life. This furthered Cody's determination to get Frederici to agree to a \"quiet legal separation,\" in order to avoid \"war and publicity.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The court records and depositions that were kept with the court case threatened to ruin Cody's respectability and credibility. His private life had not been open to the public before, and the application for divorce brought unwanted attention to the matter. Not only did townspeople feel the need to take sides in the divorce, but headlines rang out with information about Cody's alleged infidelities or Federici's excesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCody's two main allegations against his wife were that she attempted to poison him on multiple occasions (this allegation was later proved false) and that she made living in North Platte \"unbearable and intolerable\" for Cody and his guests.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Buffalo Bill's America: William Cody and the Wild West Show|last=Warren|first=Louis|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2005|isbn=0-375-72658-6|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/buffalobillsamer00warr/page/490 490\u2013515]|url=https://archive.org/details/buffalobillsamer00warr/page/490}}</ref> The press picked up on the story immediately, creating a battle between Cody and Frederici's teams of lawyers, both of which seemed to be the better authority on Nebraska divorce law.<ref name=\":1\" /> Divorce laws varied from state to state in the early 1900s.

Frederici was furious and refused any temporary reconciliation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Cody decided to continue pursuing the divorce, adding to his complaint that Frederici would not sign mortgages and that she had subjected him to \"extreme cruelty\" in blaming him for the death of Arta. When the trial proceeded a year later, in 1905, both their tempers were still hot. The final ruling was that \"incompatibility was not grounds for divorce,\" so that the couple was to stay legally married.<ref name=\":1\" /> The judge and the public sided with Frederici, the judge deciding that her husband's alleged affairs and his sisters' meddling in his marriage had caused his unhappiness, not his wife.

Her name, meaning \"the black,\" suggests that she presided over [[Underworld#Greek mythology|subterranean]] nymphs.\n\nThese three bee maidens with the power of [[divination]] and thus speaking truth are described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Hymn to Hermes]]'', and the food of the gods is \"identified as honey\"; the bee maidens were originally associated with [[Apollo]], and are probably not correctly identified with the Thriae.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa (\"Bee\"); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from [[Helladic period|Mycenean times]].
