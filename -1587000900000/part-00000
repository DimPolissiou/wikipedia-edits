WZID is located on Commercial Street in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].  Its signal can be heard as far south as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], as far east as southern [[Maine]] and as far west as [[Vermont]]. WZID also broadcasts in HD Radio.\n\n==History==\nThe station was born October 2, 1947 as '''WKBR-FM'''. Throughout the 1960s, and very early 1970s, WKBR-FM simulcasted the [[top 40]] format of WKBR 1250 (now [[WGAM]]), providing that station with significant extended coverage. In July 1971, WKBR-FM became '''WZID''', and the format was flipped to [[beautiful music]].  In the 1980s, instrumental [[easy listening]] music was scaled back, with soft vocal hits added, to the point where the station evolved into an adult contemporary station.  In October 1990, Sunshine Broadcasting of New Hampshire Inc. announced the sale of WZID and 1370 [[WFEA (AM)]] to Saga Communications Inc. of [[Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan]]. The sale was finalized April 16, 1991. Saga Communications of New England LLC operates the station today. WZID's President and General Manager is Bob Cox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfrommars.com/wfea.html|title=WFEA History|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>\n\n==Translators==\n[[File:WZID-HD2 94.1-103.1 logo.png|thumb|left|160px|Former logo for WZID-HD2, used from January 2009 until the split of FM translator W276BJ 103.1 FM Concord on February 1, 2017 to simulcast WZID-HD3 \"103.1 The Outlaw\".]]\nWZID used to be heard on translator station, W270AH 101.9 in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]]. However in 2008, Saga Communications filed a series of minor translator applications which moved the translator into the [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] radio market as W276CB, a translator of Saga radio station [[WKNE]]'s HD3 channel as \"Kool 103.1\" (now [[WINQ-FM]]'s HD2 channel as \"WINK Classic Country 103.1FM\").\n\nUp until mid-January 2009, WZID had two more translators, W231BR 94.1 in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] at 250 watts and W276BJ 103.1 in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], also at 250 watts, but in January 2009 those two translators were turned into the new \"Hot Hits 94.1 and 103.1\", a simulcast of WZID's HD2 channel, which is a [[top 40]] station broadcasting [[Dial Global]]'s [[Hits Now!]] format; branding themselves as the new hit music station in New Hampshire. Saga Communications obviously had been planning this out for some time because both the translator's power was recently increased from low power to 250 watts. This station was a direct competitor to Manchester\u2019s heritage CHR 105.5 [[WJYY]], but had an inferior signal compared to it.{{fact|date=December 2013}} Saga was able to open up this new station due to a loophole in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules that allows HD sub-channel stations to be repeated on translators.{{fact|date=December 2013}} On December 11, 2013, Hot Hits had short-lived intentions of increasing the [[Height above average terrain|HAAT]] of W231BR up to 270 meters to provide significant coverage improvements to the Keene, Portsmouth and Lowell areas; however, this signal upgrade had never occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fccdata.org/?facid=140894&appid=1591648&i=2|title=FCCdata.org|accessdate=2017-09-09}}</ref> On August 18, 2014, WZID was granted permission to implement W231BR's current HAAT of {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} (although the [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] of the translator would remain at 250 Watts), to improve W231BR's coverage of surrounding communities (such as Keene, Portsmouth and Lowell), although to a somewhat lesser extent of signal improvement than originally contemplated back in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fccdata.org/?facid=140894&appid=1641439&i=2|title=FCCdata.org|accessdate=2017-09-09}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in mid July 2015, WZID began simulcasting sister station [[WFEA]] on its HD3 channel which in turn is broadcast on newly purchased 110-watt translator W260CF serving the greater Manchester area from its tower on [[Uncanoonuc_Mountains|Mt.

Normally the same builders and carvers worked for all religions, and regional and period styles are generally similar.  For over 1,000 years the basic layout of a Hindu or most Jain temples has consisted of a small [[garbhagriha]] or sanctuary for the main [[murti]] or [[cult image]]s, over which the high superstructure rises, then one or more larger [[mandapa]] halls.\n\n[[M\u0101ru-Gurjara architecture]] or the \"Solanki style\" is, a particular temple style from [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] (both regions with a strong Jain presence) that originated in both Hindu and Jain temples around 1000, but became enduringly popular with Jain patrons.  It has remained in use, in somewhat modified form, to the present day, indeed also becoming popular again for some Hindu temples in the last century.  The style is seen in the groups of pilgrimage temples at [[Dilwara Temples|Dilwara]] on [[Mount Abu]], [[Taranga Jain temple|Taranga]], [[Girnar Jain temples|Girnar]] and [[Palitana temples|Palitana]].<ref>Hegewald</ref>       \n\n==Terms==\n'''Derasar''' is a word used for a Jain temple in Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. '''Basadi''' is a [[Jain]] shrine or temple in Karnataka.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=234\n|title=Basadi\n|publisher=\n}}</ref> The word is generally used in [[South India]]. Its historical use in [[North India]] is preserved in the names of the [[Dilwara Temples|Vimala Vasahi]] and [[Dilwara Temples|Luna Vasahi]] temples of [[Mount Abu]]. The Sanskrit word is ''vasati'', it implies an institution including residences of scholars attached to the shrine.<ref name=\"glossary\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php\n|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent \u2013 Glossary\n|publisher=\n}}</ref>\n\nTemples may be divided into [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-bandhi Jain temples, public dedicated temple buildings, normally with a high superstructure, typically a north Indian [[shikhara]] tower above the shrine) and the [[Ghar Jain temple]], a private Jain house shrine.  A Jain temple which is known as a pilgrimage centre is often termed a [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Tirtha]].\n\nThe main image of a Jain temple is known as a ''mula nayak''.<ref>Jaina Iconography, Volume 1 of Jaina-r\u016bpa-ma\u1e47\u1e0dana, Umakant Premanand Shah, Abhinav Publications, 1987,p. 149</ref>  A [[Manastambha]] (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. It has four 'Moortis' i.e. stone figures of the main god of that temple. One facing each direction: North, East, South and West.<ref>http://www.pluralism.org/religion/jainism/introduction/tirthankaras</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Aerial view of Bahubali, Gomateswara Jain temple, Karkala.jpg|thumb|Jain Tirtha, [[Shravanabelagola]], with the colossal [[Gommateshwara statue]].]]\nJain temples are built with various architectural designs.<ref>''Jain temples in India and around the world'', Laxmi Mall Singhvi, Tarun Chopra, Himalayan Books, 2002</ref>  The earliest survivals of Jain architecture are part of the [[Indian rock-cut architecture]] tradition, initially shared with Buddhism, and by the end of the classical period with Hinduism. Very often numbers of rock-cut Jain temples and monasteries share a site with those of the other religions, as at [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]], [[Bava Pyara Caves|Bava Pyara]], Ellora, [[Aihole]], [[Badami cave temples|Badami]], and [[Kalugumalai Jain Beds|Kalugumalai]].  The [[Ellora Caves]] are a late site, which contains temples of all three religions, as the earlier Buddhist ones give way to later Hindu excavations.\n\nThere is considerable similarity between the styles of the different religions, but often the Jains placed large figures of one or more of the 24 [[tirthankara]]s in the open air rather than inside the shrine.  These statues later began to be very large, normally standing nude figures in the ''[[kayotsarga]]'' meditation position (which is similar to standing [[at attention]]).  Examples include the [[Gopachal rock cut Jain monuments]] and the [[Siddhachal Caves]], with groups of statues, and a number of single figures including the 12th-century [[Gommateshwara statue]], and the modern [[Statue of Vasupujya]] and, largest of all at 108 feet (32.9 meters) tall, the [[Statue of Ahimsa]].\n\nIn recent times, the use of murti images has become controversial within Jainism, and some smaller sects reject them entirely, while others are selective in terms of which figures they allow images of.  In sects which largely disapprove of images, the religious buildings are far more simple.  \n \nFollowing the regional styles in Hindu temples, Jain temples in North India generally use the north Indian [[nagara architecture|nagara]] style, while those in South India use the dravida style, although the north Indian [[M\u0101ru-Gurjara style]] or Solanki style has made some inroads in the south over the last century or so.  For example, the [[Mel Sithamur Jain Math]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] has a large [[gopuram]] tower, similar to those of local Hindu temples.\n[[File:Delwada.jpg|thumb|Temple interior, [[Dilwara Temples|Dilwara]]]]\n\nCharactistics of the original M\u0101ru-Gurjara style are \"the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of mouldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and [[k\u012brttimukha]]s. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.\"  The main [[shikhara]] tower usually has many ''[[urushringa]]'' subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples.<ref>Hegewald</ref>  \n\nLater, with Dilwara in the lead, surrounding the main temple with a curtain of ''devakulik\u0101'' shrines, each with a small spire became a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples. These are fairly plain on the outer walls, and often raised on a very high platform, so that the outside of larger temples can resemble a fortress with high walls.<ref>Harle, 228</ref>  However the entrance(s), often up high, wide steps, are not designed for actual defence, even though medieval Muslim armies and others destroyed many Jain temples in the past, often permanently. \n\nInside the temple, the M\u0101ru-Gurjara style features extremely lavish carving, especially on columns, large and intricately carved rosettes on the ceilings of mandapas, and a characteristic form of \"flying arch\" between columns, which has no structural role, and is purely decorative.

Instead they were typically funded by wealthy Jain individuals or families.

Normally the same builders and carvers worked for all religions, and regional and period styles are generally similar.  For over 1,000 years the basic layout of a Hindu or most Jain temples has consisted of a small [[garbhagriha]] or sanctuary for the main [[murti]] or [[cult image]]s, over which the high superstructure rises, then one or more larger [[mandapa]] halls.\n\n[[M\u0101ru-Gurjara architecture]] or the \"Solanki style\" is, a particular temple style from [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] (both regions with a strong Jain presence) that originated in both Hindu and Jain temples around 1000, but became enduringly popular with Jain patrons.  It has remained in use, in somewhat modified form, to the present day, indeed also becoming popular again for some Hindu temples in the last century.  The style is seen in the groups of pilgrimage temples at [[Dilwara Temples|Dilwara]] on [[Mount Abu]], [[Taranga Jain temple|Taranga]], [[Girnar Jain temples|Girnar]] and [[Palitana temples|Palitana]].<ref>Hegewald</ref>       \n\n==Terms==\n'''Derasar''' is a word used for a Jain temple in Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. '''Basadi''' is a [[Jain]] shrine or temple in Karnataka.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=234\n|title=Basadi\n|publisher=\n}}</ref> The word is generally used in [[South India]]. Its historical use in [[North India]] is preserved in the names of the [[Dilwara Temples|Vimala Vasahi]] and [[Dilwara Temples|Luna Vasahi]] temples of [[Mount Abu]]. The Sanskrit word is ''vasati'', it implies an institution including residences of scholars attached to the shrine.<ref name=\"glossary\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php\n|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent \u2013 Glossary\n|publisher=\n}}</ref>\n\nTemples may be divided into [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-bandhi Jain temples, public dedicated temple buildings, normally with a high superstructure, typically a north Indian [[shikhara]] tower above the shrine) and the [[Ghar Jain temple]], a private Jain house shrine.  A Jain temple which is known as a pilgrimage centre is often termed a [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Tirtha]].\n\nThe main image of a Jain temple is known as a ''mula nayak''.<ref>Jaina Iconography, Volume 1 of Jaina-r\u016bpa-ma\u1e47\u1e0dana, Umakant Premanand Shah, Abhinav Publications, 1987,p. 149</ref>  A [[Manastambha]] (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. It has four 'Moortis' i.e. stone figures of the main god of that temple. One facing each direction: North, East, South and West.<ref>http://www.pluralism.org/religion/jainism/introduction/tirthankaras</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Aerial view of Bahubali, Gomateswara Jain temple, Karkala.jpg|thumb|Jain Tirtha, [[Shravanabelagola]], with the colossal [[Gommateshwara statue]].]]\nJain temples are built with various architectural designs.<ref>''Jain temples in India and around the world'', Laxmi Mall Singhvi, Tarun Chopra, Himalayan Books, 2002</ref>  The earliest survivals of Jain architecture are part of the [[Indian rock-cut architecture]] tradition, initially shared with Buddhism, and by the end of the classical period with Hinduism. Very often numbers of rock-cut Jain temples and monasteries share a site with those of the other religions, as at [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]], [[Bava Pyara Caves|Bava Pyara]], Ellora, [[Aihole]], [[Badami cave temples|Badami]], and [[Kalugumalai Jain Beds|Kalugumalai]].  The [[Ellora Caves]] are a late site, which contains temples of all three religions, as the earlier Buddhist ones give way to later Hindu excavations.\n\nThere is considerable similarity between the styles of the different religions, but often the Jains placed large figures of one or more of the 24 [[tirthankara]]s in the open air rather than inside the shrine.  These statues later began to be very large, normally standing nude figures in the ''[[kayotsarga]]'' meditation position (which is similar to standing [[at attention]]).  Examples include the [[Gopachal rock cut Jain monuments]] and the [[Siddhachal Caves]], with groups of statues, and a number of single figures including the 12th-century [[Gommateshwara statue]], and the modern [[Statue of Vasupujya]] and, largest of all at 108 feet (32.9 meters) tall, the [[Statue of Ahimsa]].\n\nIn recent times, the use of murti images has become controversial within Jainism, and some smaller sects reject them entirely, while others are selective in terms of which figures they allow images of.  In sects which largely disapprove of images, the religious buildings are far more simple.  \n \nFollowing the regional styles in Hindu temples, Jain temples in North India generally use the north Indian [[nagara]] style, while those in South India use the dravida style, although the north Indian [[M\u0101ru-Gurjara style]] or Solanki style has made some inroads in the south over the last century or so.  For example, the [[Mel Sithamur Jain Math]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] has a large [[gopuram]] tower, similar to those of local Hindu temples.\n[[File:Delwada.jpg|thumb|Temple interior, [[Dilwara Temples|Dilwara]]]]\n\nCharactistics of the original M\u0101ru-Gurjara style are \"the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of mouldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and [[k\u012brttimukha]]s. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.\"  The main [[shikhara]] tower usually has many ''[[urushringa]]'' subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples.<ref>Hegewald</ref>  \n\nLater, with Dilwara in the lead, surrounding the main temple with a curtain of ''devakulik\u0101'' shrines, each with a small spire became a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples. These are fairly plain on the outer walls, and often raised on a very high platform, so that the outside of larger temples can resemble a fortress with high walls.<ref>Harle, 228</ref>  However the entrance(s), often up high, wide steps, are not designed for actual defence, even though medieval Muslim armies and others destroyed many Jain temples in the past, often permanently. \n\nInside the temple, the M\u0101ru-Gurjara style features extremely lavish carving, especially on columns, large and intricately carved rosettes on the ceilings of mandapas, and a characteristic form of \"flying arch\" between columns, which has no structural role, and is purely decorative. Most early temples in the style are in various local shades of pink, buff or brown sandstone, but the Dilwara temples are in a very pure white marble which lightens the style and has become considered very desirable.\n\nWhile, before [[British India]], large Buddhist or Hindu temples (and indeed Muslim mosques) have very often been built with funds from a ruler, this was infrequently the case with Jain temples.  Instead they were typically funded by wealthy Jain individuals or families.  For this reason, and often the smaller numbers of Jains in the population, Jain temples tend to be at the small or middle end of the range of sizes, but at pilgrimage sites they may cluster in large groups - there are altogether several hundred at [[Palitana temples|Palitana]], tightly packed within several high-walled compounds called \"tuks\" or \"tonks\".<ref>\"Temple-cities\"; see also Mitchell (1990) by sites</ref>  Temple charitable trusts, such as the very large [[Anandji Kalyanji Trust]], founded in the 17th century and now maintaining 1,200 temples, play a very important role in funding temple building and maintenance.\n\n==Etiquette==\nThere are some guidelines to follow when one is visiting a Jain temple:<ref>CultureShock! India: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette, Gitanjali Kolanad,\nMarshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008 p. 45</ref>\n*Before entering the temple, one should bathe and wear fresh washed clothes or some special puja (worship) clothes \u2013 while wearing these one must neither have eaten anything nor visited the washroom. However, drinking of water is permitted. \n*One should not take any footwear (including socks) inside the temple. Leather items like a belt, purse etc. are not allowed inside the temple premises.\n*One should not be chewing any edibles (food, gum, mints, etc.), and no edibles should be stuck in the mouth.\n* One should try to keep as silent as possible inside temple.\n* Mobile phones should not be used in the temple.

{"title_page": "Lugiato\u2013Lefever equation", "text_new": "{{technical|date=July 2018}}\nThe model usually designated as '''Lugiato\u2013Lefever equation (LLE)''' was formulated in 1987 by [[Luigi Lugiato]] and Ren\u00e8 Lefever \n<ref name=lugiato87/> as a paradigm for spontaneous [[pattern formation]] in nonlinear optical systems.<ref name=turing52/><ref name=prigogine77/><ref name=haken83/> The patterns originate from the interaction of a coherent field, that is injected into a resonant optical cavity, with a [[Kerr effect|Kerr]] medium that fills the cavity.\n\nThe same equation governs two kinds of patterns: stationary patterns that arise in the planes orthogonal with respect to the direction of propagation of light (''transverse patterns'') and patterns that form in the longitudinal direction (''longitudinal'' ''patterns''), travel along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and give rise to a sequence of pulses in the output of the cavity.\n\nThe case of longitudinal patterns is intrinsically linked to the phenomenon of \u201c[[Kerr frequency comb]]s\u201d in microresonators, discovered in 2007 by Tobias Kippenberg and collaborators,<ref name=haye2007/> that has raised a very lively interest, especially because of the applicative avenue it has opened. \n__TOC__\n\n== The equation ==\nFigure 1 shows a light beam that propagates in the <math>z</math> direction, while <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are the transverse directions. If we assume that the electric field as <math>{\\cal E}(x,y,z,t)</math> , where <math>t</math> denotes time, is linearly polarized and therefore can be treated as a scalar, we can express it in terms of the slowly varying normalized complex envelope <math>E(x,y,z,t)</math> in this way\n[[Image:Beamreference.png|thumb|upright=1.3|'''Figure 1.''' A light beam propagates along the <math>z</math> direction. <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are the transverse directions]]\n\n:<math>{\\cal E}(x,y,z,t)\\propto E(x,y,z,t)e^{i(\\omega_0/\\tilde{c})(z-\\tilde{c}t)} + \\text{c.c.} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_0</math> is the frequency of the light beam that is injected into the cavity and <math>\\tilde{c}</math> of the light velocity in the [[Kerr effect|Kerr medium]] that fills the cavity. For definiteness, consider a ring cavity (Fig. 2) of very high quality (High-Q cavity).\n[[Image:Ringcavity2.png|thumb|upright=1.3|'''Figure 2.''' Top view of ring cavity]]\n\nIn the original LLE,<ref name=lugiato87/> one assumes conditions such that the envelope <math>E</math> is independent of the longitudinal variable <math>z</math> ( i.e. uniform along the cavity), so that <math>E=E(x,y,t)</math>. The equation reads\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\bar{t}}=E_\\text{in}-E-i\\theta E+i|E|^2 E+i\\nabla^2_\\perp E</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2_\\perp E=\\frac{\\partial^2E}{\\partial \\bar{x}^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2E}{\\partial \\bar{y}^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{t}</math> and <math>\\bar{x}</math>, <math>\\bar{y}</math> are normalized temporal and spatial variables, i.e. <math>\\bar{t}=\\kappa t</math>, <math>\\bar{x}=x/\\ell_d</math>, <math>\\bar{y}=y/\\ell_d</math>, with <math>\\kappa</math> being the cavity decay rate or cavity linewidth, <math>\\ell_d</math> the diffraction length in the cavity. <math>\\theta=(\\omega_c-\\omega_0)/\\kappa</math> is the cavity detuning parameter, with <math>\\omega_c</math> being the cavity frequency nearest to <math>\\omega_0</math>. In the righthand side of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), <math>E_\\text{in}</math> is the normalized amplitude of the input field that is injected into the cavity, \nthe second is the decay term, the third is the detuning term, the fourth is the cubic nonlinear term that takes into account the Kerr medium, the last term with the transverse Laplacian <math>\\nabla_\\perp^2</math> describes diffraction in the paraxial approximation. Conditions of self-focusing are assumed.\n\nWe refer to Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) as the transverse LLE. Some years later than,<ref name=lugiato87/> there was the formulation of the longitudinal LLE, in which diffraction is replaced by dispersion.<ref name=haelterman92/><ref name=brambilla93/> In this case one assumes that the envelope <math>E</math> is independent of the transverse variables <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, so that <math>E=E(z,t)</math>. The longitudinal LLE reads\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\bar{t}}=E_\\text{in}-E-i\\theta E+i|E|^2 E+i\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial\\bar{z}^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwith <math>\\bar{z}=z/a</math>, where <math>a</math> depends, in particular on the dispersion parameter at second order. Conditions of anomalous dispersion are assumed. An important point is that, once <math>E(\\bar{z},\\bar{t})</math> is obtained by solving Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}), one must come back to the original variables <math>z,t</math> and replace <math>z</math> by <math>z-\\tilde{c}t</math>, so that a <math>z</math>-dependent stationary solution (stationary pattern) becomes a travelling pattern (with velocity <math>\\tilde{c}</math>).\n\nFrom a mathematical viewpoint, the LLE amounts to a driven, damped, detuned [[nonlinear Schroedinger equation]].\n\nThe transverse LLE ({{EquationNote|1}}) is in 2D from the spatial viewpoint. In a waveguide configuration <math>E</math> depends only on one spatial variable, say <math>x</math>, and the transverse Laplacian is replaced by <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\bar{x}^2}</math> and one has the transverse LLE in 1D. The longitudinal LLE ({{EquationNote|2}}) is equivalent to the transverse LLE in 1D.\n\nIn some papers dealing with the longitudinal case one considers dispersion beyond the second order, so that Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}) includes also terms with derivatives of order higher than second with respect to <math>\\bar{z}</math>.\n\n== Uniform stationary solutions. Connection with ''[[optical bistability]]''. [[Four-wave mixing]] and [[pattern formation]]. == \n[[Image:Bistabilitytht4.png|thumb|upright=1.2|'''Figure 3.''' Stationary curve of the normalized output intensity <math>|E|^2</math> as a function of the normalized input intensity\n<math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> for <math>\\theta=4</math>. The stationary states in the segment with negative slope are unstable. The arrows show the hysteresis cycle which is covered\nwhen <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> is increased and then decreased.]]\nLet us focus on the case in which the envelope <math>E</math> is constant, i.e. on the stationary solutions that are independent of all spatial variables. By dropping all derivatives in Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}), and taking the squared modulus, one obtains the stationary equation\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>|E_\\text{in}|^2=|E|^2\\left\\{1+(\\theta-|E|^2)^2\\right\\}</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nIf we plot the stationary curve of <math>|E|^2</math> as a function of <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math>, \nwhen <math>\\theta>\\sqrt{3} </math> we obtain a curve as that shown in Fig.3.\n\nThe curve is <math>S</math>-shaped and \nthere is an interval of values of <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> where one has three stationary states. However,the states that lie in the segment with negative slope are unstable, so that in the interval there are two coexisting stable stationary states: this phenomenon is called ''optical bistability''.<ref name=gibbs85/> If the input intensity <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> is increased and then decreased, one covers a hysteresis cycle.\n\nIf we refer to the modes of the empty cavity, in the case of the uniform stationary solutions described by Eq.({{EquationNote|3}}) the electric field is singlemode, corresponding to the mode of frequency <math>\\omega_c</math> quasi-resonant with the input frequency <math>\\omega_0</math>.\n\nIn the transverse configuration of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), in the case of these stationary solutions E corresponds to a singlemode plane wave <math>e^{i(k_x x+k_y y)}</math> with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math>, where <math>k_x</math> and <math>k_y</math> are the transverse components of the wave vector, exactly as the input field <math>E_\\text{in}</math>.\n\nThe cubic Kerr nonlinearity of Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives rise to [[four-wave mixing]] (FWM) , which can generate other modes, so that the envelope <math>E</math> displays a spatial pattern: in the transverse plane in the case of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), along the cavity in the case of Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}).\n\n== Transverse patterns and ''cavity solitons''== \nIn the transverse case of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) the pattern arises from the interplay of FWM and diffraction. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math> are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits pairs of photons with <math>k_x=\\bar{k}_x</math>, <math>k_y=0</math> and <math>k_x=-\\bar{k}_x</math>, <math>k_y=0</math> in such a way that the total energy of photons, and their total momentum, are conserved (Fig.4). \n[[File:Fig4wavemixing.png|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' A four-wave mixing process in which two photons with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math> are absorbed and two photons with <math>k_x=\\bar{k}_x, k_y=0</math> and <math>k_x=-\\bar{k}_x,k_y=0</math> are emitted. <math>k_x</math>, <math>k_y</math> and <math>k_z</math> are the components of the wave-vectors.]]\nActually further FWM processes enter into play, so that <math>E(x,y)</math> assumes the configuration of a hexagonal pattern <ref name=gomila2007/>(see Fig.5). \n[[File:Microringhexag.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|'''Figure 5.''' A typical pattern configuration that arises in the transverse planes in the output is a hexagonal pattern.]]\nA pattern displays an ordered array of intensity peaks. It is possible to generate also isolated intensity peaks,<ref name=scroggie94/> that are called ''cavity soliton''s (see Fig. 6). Since cavity solitons can be \u201cwritten\u201dand \u201cerased\u201d one by one in the transverse plane like in a blackboard, they are of great interest for applications to optical information processing and telecommunications.\n[[File:Cavitysoliton.png|thumb|'''Figure 6.''' A typical Kerr cavity soliton in the transverse plane showing a bright peak in the dark background with diffraction rings.]]\n\n== Longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons == \nIn the longitudinal case of Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}) the patterns arise from the interplay between FWM and dispersion. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons of the longitudinal mode quasi-resonant with <math>\\omega_0</math> are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits photon pairs corresponding to cavity modes symmetrically adjacent to the quasi-resonant mode, in such a way that the total photon energy, as well as the total longitudinal photon momentum, are conserved. \n[[File:Kerrpulses2.gif|thumb|upright=2|left|'''Figure 7.''' Example of longitudinal pattern that travels along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and gives rise to a periodic sequence of pulses in the output.]]\nFigure 7 shows an example of the patterns that are generated, and travel along the cavity and out of the cavity. Like in the transverse case, also in the longitudinal configuration single or multiple Kerr cavity solitons can be generated; Figure 8 illustrates the case of a single cavity soliton that circulates in the cavity and produces a sequence of narrow pulses in the output. Such solitons have been observed for the first time in a fiber cavity.<ref name=leo2010/> \n[[File:Kerrcomb.gif|thumb|upright=2|'''Figure 8.''' Longitudinal Kerr cavity solitons.]]\nIt is important to note that the instability which originates longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons in the LLE is a special case of the multimode instability of optical bistability, predicted by Bonifacio and Lugiato in <ref name=bonifacio78/> and first observed experimentally in.<ref name=segard88/>\n\n== Microresonator Kerr frequency combs and cavity solitons ==\nOptical frequency combs constitute an equidistant set of laser frequencies that can be employed to count the cycles of light. This technique, introduced by [[Theodor Haensch]] <ref name=udem2002/> and [[John L. Hall|John Hall]] <ref name=jones2000/> using [[mode locking|mode-locked lasers]], has led to myriad applications. The work <ref name=haye2007/> demonstrated the realization of broadband optical frequency combs exploiting the whispering gallery modes activated by a CW laser field injected into a high-Q microresonator filled with a Kerr medium, that gives rise to FWM. Since that time Kerr frequency combs (KFC), whose bandwidth can exceed an octave with repetition rates in the microwave to THz frequencies , have been generated in a wide variety of microresonators; for reviews on this subject see e.g.<ref name=herr2015/><ref name=chembo2016/> They offer substantial potential for miniaturization and chip-scale photonic integration, as well as for power reduction. Today KFC generation is a mature field, and this technology has been applied to several areas, including coherent telecommunications, spectroscopy, atomic clocks as well as laser ranging and astrophysical spectrometer calibration.\n\nA key impetus to these developments has been the realization of Kerr cavity solitons in microresonators,<ref name=\"herr2014\" /> opening the possibility of utilizing Kerr cavity solitons in photonic integrated microresonators.\n\nThe longitudinal LLE ({{EquationNote|2}}) provides a spatio-temporal picture of the involved phenomena, but from the spectral viewpoint its solutions correspond to KFC. The link between the topic of optical KFC and the LLE was theoretically developed in.<ref name=\"herr2014\" /><ref name=\"matsko2011\" /><ref name=\"herr2013\" /><ref name=\"chembo2013\" /><ref name=\"coen2013\" /> These authors showed that the LLE ( or generalizations including higher order dispersion terms) is the model which describes the generation of KFC and is capable of predicting their properties when the system parameters are varied. The spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and solitons travelling along the cavity described by the LLE is the spatiotemporal equivalent of the frequency combs and governs their features. The rather idealized conditions assumed in the formulation of the LLE, especially the high-Q condition, have been perfectly materialized by the spectacular technological progress that has occurred in the meantime in the field of photonics and has led, in particular, to the discovery of KFC.\n\n== Quantum aspects ==\nThe two photons that, as shown in Fig.4, are emitted in symmetrically tilted directions in the FWM process, are in a state of ''[[quantum entanglement]]'': they are precisely correlated , for example in energy and momentum. This fact is fundamental for the quantum aspects of optical patterns. For instance, the difference between the intensities of the two symmetrical beams is squeezed, i.e. exhibits fluctuations below the shot noise level;<ref name=lugiato92/> the longitudinal analogue of this phenomenon has been observed experimentally in KFC.<ref name=dutt2015/> In turn, such quantum aspects are basic for the field of [[quantum imaging]].<ref name=gatti2008/><ref name=kolobov99/>\n\n== Review articles ==\nFor reviews on the subject of the LLE, see also.<ref name=lugiato2015/><ref name=castelli2017/><ref name=lugiato2018/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Four-wave mixing]] \n*[[Frequency comb]]\n*[[Kerr frequency comb]]\n*[[Nonlinear Schroedinger equation]]\n*[[Optical bistability]]\n*[[Pattern formation]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=lugiato87>{{cite journal\n |title=Spatial Dissipative Structures in Passive Optical Systems\n |last=Lugiato |first=L.A. \n |last2=Lefever |first2=R. \n |journal=Physical Review Letters\n |volume=58\n |issue=21\n |pages=2209\u20132211\n |year=1987\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.2209\n |pmid=10034681 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..58.2209L\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=turing52>{{cite journal\n |title=The chemical basis of morphogenesis\n |last=Turing |first=A.M.. \n |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences \n |volume=237\n |issue=641 |pages=37\u201372\n |year=1952\n |doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012\n |bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=prigogine77>{{cite book\n |title=Self-organization in nonequilibrium systems.

"{{technical|date=July 2018}}\nThe model usually designated as '''Lugiato\u2013Lefever equation (LLE)''' was formulated in 1987 by [[Luigi Lugiato]] and Ren\u00e8 Lefever \n<ref name=lugiato87/> as a paradigm for spontaneous [[pattern formation]] in nonlinear optical systems.<ref name=turing52/><ref name=prigogine77/><ref name=haken83/> The patterns originate from the interaction of a coherent field, that is injected into a resonant optical cavity, with a [[Kerr effect|Kerr]] medium that fills the cavity.\n\nThe same equation governs two kinds of patterns: stationary patterns that arise in the planes orthogonal with respect to the direction of propagation of light (''transverse patterns'') and patterns that form in the longitudinal direction (''longitudinal'' ''patterns''), travel along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and give rise to a sequence of pulses in the output of the cavity.\n\nThe case of longitudinal patterns is intrinsically linked to the phenomenon of \u201c[[Kerr frequency comb]]s\u201d in microresonators, discovered in 2007 by Tobias Kippenberg and collaborators,<ref name=haye2007/> that has raised a very lively interest, especially because of the applicative avenue it has opened. \n__TOC__\n\n== The equation ==\nFigure 1 shows a light beam that propagates in the <math>z</math> direction, while <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are the transverse directions. If we assume that the electric field as <math>{\\cal E}(x,y,z,t)</math> , where <math>t</math> denotes time, is linearly polarized and therefore can be treated as a scalar, we can express it in terms of the slowly varying normalized complex envelope <math>E(x,y,z,t)</math> in this way\n[[Image:Beamreference.png|thumb|upright=1.3|'''Figure 1.''' A light beam propagates along the <math>z</math> direction. <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are the transverse directions]]\n\n:<math>{\\cal E}(x,y,z,t)\\propto E(x,y,z,t)e^{i(\\omega_0/\\tilde{c})(z-\\tilde{c}t)} + \\text{c.c.} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_0</math> is the frequency of the light beam that is injected into the cavity and <math>\\tilde{c}</math> of the light velocity in the [[Kerr effect|Kerr medium]] that fills the cavity. For definiteness, consider a ring cavity (Fig. 2) of very high quality (High-Q cavity).\n[[Image:Ringcavity2.png|thumb|upright=1.3|'''Figure 2.''' Top view of ring cavity]]\n\nIn the original LLE,<ref name=lugiato87/> one assumes conditions such that the envelope <math>E</math> is independent of the longitudinal variable <math>z</math> ( i.e. uniform along the cavity), so that <math>E=E(x,y,t)</math>. The equation reads\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\bar{t}}=E_\\text{in}-E-i\\theta E+i|E|^2 E+i\\nabla^2_\\perp E</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2_\\perp E=\\frac{\\partial^2E}{\\partial \\bar{x}^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2E}{\\partial \\bar{y}^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{t}</math> and <math>\\bar{x}</math>, <math>\\bar{y}</math> are normalized temporal and spatial variables, i.e. <math>\\bar{t}=\\kappa t</math>, <math>\\bar{x}=x/\\ell_d</math>, <math>\\bar{y}=y/\\ell_d</math>, with <math>\\kappa</math> being the cavity decay rate or cavity linewidth, <math>\\ell_d</math> the diffraction length in the cavity. <math>\\theta=(\\omega_c-\\omega_0)/\\kappa</math> is the cavity detuning parameter, with <math>\\omega_c</math> being the cavity frequency nearest to <math>\\omega_0</math>. In the righthand side of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), <math>E_\\text{in}</math> is the normalized amplitude of the input field that is injected into the cavity, \nthe second is the decay term, the third is the detuning term, the fourth is the cubic nonlinear term that takes into account the Kerr medium, the last term with the transverse Laplacian <math>\\nabla_\\perp^2</math> describes diffraction in the paraxial approximation. Conditions of self-focusing are assumed.\n\nWe refer to Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) as the transverse LLE. Some years later than,<ref name=lugiato87/> there was the formulation of the longitudinal LLE, in which diffraction is replaced by dispersion.<ref name=haelterman92/><ref name=brambilla93/> In this case one assumes that the envelope <math>E</math> is independent of the transverse variables <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, so that <math>E=E(z,t)</math>. The longitudinal LLE reads\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\bar{t}}=E_\\text{in}-E-i\\theta E+i|E|^2 E+i\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial\\bar{z}^2}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwith <math>\\bar{z}=z/a</math>, where <math>a</math> depends, in particular on the dispersion parameter at second order. Conditions of anomalous dispersion are assumed. An important point is that, once <math>E(\\bar{z},\\bar{t})</math> is obtained by solving Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}), one must come back to the original variables <math>z,t</math> and replace <math>z</math> by <math>z-\\tilde{c}t</math>, so that a <math>z</math>-dependent stationary solution (stationary pattern) becomes a travelling pattern (with velocity <math>\\tilde{c}</math>).\n\nFrom a mathematical viewpoint, the LLE amounts to a driven, damped, detuned [[nonlinear Schroedinger equation]].\n\nThe transverse LLE ({{EquationNote|1}}) is in 2D from the spatial viewpoint. In a waveguide configuration <math>E</math> depends only on one spatial variable, say <math>x</math>, and the transverse Laplacian is replaced by <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\bar{x}^2}</math> and one has the transverse LLE in 1D. The longitudinal LLE ({{EquationNote|2}}) is equivalent to the transverse LLE in 1D.\n\nIn some papers dealing with the longitudinal case one considers dispersion beyond the second order, so that Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}) includes also terms with derivatives of order higher than second with respect to <math>\\bar{z}</math>.\n\n== Uniform stationary solutions. Connection with ''[[optical bistability]]''. [[Four-wave mixing]] and [[pattern formation]]. == \n[[Image:Bistabilitytht4.png|thumb|upright=1.2|'''Figure 3.''' Stationary curve of the normalized output intensity <math>|E|^2</math> as a function of the normalized input intensity\n<math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> for <math>\\theta=4</math>. The stationary states in the segment with negative slope are unstable. The arrows show the hysteresis cycle which is covered\nwhen <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> is increased and then decreased.]]\nLet us focus on the case in which the envelope <math>E</math> is constant, i.e. on the stationary solutions that are independent of all spatial variables. By dropping all derivatives in Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) one obtains the stationary equation\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>|E_\\text{in}|^2=|E|^2\\left\\{1+(\\theta-|E|^2)^2\\right\\}</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nIf we plot the stationary curve of <math>|E|^2</math> as a function of <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math>, \nwhen <math>\\theta>\\sqrt{3} </math> we obtain a curve as that shown in Fig.3.\n\nThe curve is <math>S</math>-shaped and \nthere is an interval of values of <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> where one has three stationary states. However,the states that lie in the segment with negative slope are unstable, so that in the interval there are two coexisting stable stationary states: this phenomenon is called ''optical bistability''.<ref name=gibbs85/> If the input intensity <math>|E_\\text{in}|^2</math> is increased and then decreased, one covers a hysteresis cycle.\n\nIf we refer to the modes of the empty cavity, in the case of the uniform stationary solutions described by Eq.({{EquationNote|3}}) the electric field is singlemode, corresponding to the mode of frequency <math>\\omega_c</math> quasi-resonant with the input frequency <math>\\omega_0</math>.\n\nIn the transverse configuration of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), in the case of these stationary solutions E corresponds to a singlemode plane wave <math>e^{i(k_x x+k_y y)}</math> with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math>, where <math>k_x</math> and <math>k_y</math> are the transverse components of the wave vector, exactly as the input field <math>E_\\text{in}</math>.\n\nThe cubic Kerr nonlinearity of Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives rise to [[four-wave mixing]] (FWM) , which can generate other modes, so that the envelope <math>E</math> displays a spatial pattern: in the transverse plane in the case of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}), along the cavity in the case of Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}).\n\n== Transverse patterns and ''cavity solitons''== \nIn the transverse case of Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) the pattern arises from the interplay of FWM and diffraction. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math> are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits pairs of photons with <math>k_x=\\bar{k}_x</math>, <math>k_y=0</math> and <math>k_x=-\\bar{k}_x</math>, <math>k_y=0</math> in such a way that the total energy of photons, and their total momentum, are conserved (Fig.4). \n[[File:Fig4wavemixing.png|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' A four-wave mixing process in which two photons with <math>k_x=k_y=0</math> are absorbed and two photons with <math>k_x=\\bar{k}_x, k_y=0</math> and <math>k_x=-\\bar{k}_x,k_y=0</math> are emitted. <math>k_x</math>, <math>k_y</math> and <math>k_z</math> are the components of the wave-vectors.]]\nActually further FWM processes enter into play, so that <math>E(x,y)</math> assumes the configuration of a hexagonal pattern <ref name=gomila2007/>(see Fig.5). \n[[File:Microringhexag.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|'''Figure 5.''' A typical pattern configuration that arises in the transverse planes in the output is a hexagonal pattern.]]\nA pattern displays an ordered array of intensity peaks. It is possible to generate also isolated intensity peaks,<ref name=scroggie94/> that are called ''cavity soliton''s (see Fig. 6). Since cavity solitons can be \u201cwritten\u201dand \u201cerased\u201d one by one in the transverse plane like in a blackboard, they are of great interest for applications to optical information processing and telecommunications.\n[[File:Cavitysoliton.png|thumb|'''Figure 6.''' A typical Kerr cavity soliton in the transverse plane showing a bright peak in the dark background with diffraction rings.]]\n\n== Longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons == \nIn the longitudinal case of Eq.({{EquationNote|2}}) the patterns arise from the interplay between FWM and dispersion. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons of the longitudinal mode quasi-resonant with <math>\\omega_0</math> are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits photon pairs corresponding to cavity modes symmetrically adjacent to the quasi-resonant mode, in such a way that the total photon energy, as well as the total longitudinal photon momentum, are conserved. \n[[File:Kerrpulses2.gif|thumb|upright=2|left|'''Figure 7.''' Example of longitudinal pattern that travels along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and gives rise to a periodic sequence of pulses in the output.]]\nFigure 7 shows an example of the patterns that are generated, and travel along the cavity and out of the cavity. Like in the transverse case, also in the longitudinal configuration single or multiple Kerr cavity solitons can be generated; Figure 8 illustrates the case of a single cavity soliton that circulates in the cavity and produces a sequence of narrow pulses in the output. Such solitons have been observed for the first time in a fiber cavity.<ref name=leo2010/> \n[[File:Kerrcomb.gif|thumb|upright=2|'''Figure 8.''' Longitudinal Kerr cavity solitons.]]\nIt is important to note that the instability which originates longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons in the LLE is a special case of the multimode instability of optical bistability, predicted by Bonifacio and Lugiato in <ref name=bonifacio78/> and first observed experimentally in.<ref name=segard88/>\n\n== Microresonator Kerr frequency combs and cavity solitons ==\nOptical frequency combs constitute an equidistant set of laser frequencies that can be employed to count the cycles of light. This technique, introduced by [[Theodor Haensch]] <ref name=udem2002/> and [[John L. Hall|John Hall]] <ref name=jones2000/> using [[mode locking|mode-locked lasers]], has led to myriad applications. The work <ref name=haye2007/> demonstrated the realization of broadband optical frequency combs exploiting the whispering gallery modes activated by a CW laser field injected into a high-Q microresonator filled with a Kerr medium, that gives rise to FWM. Since that time Kerr frequency combs (KFC), whose bandwidth can exceed an octave with repetition rates in the microwave to THz frequencies , have been generated in a wide variety of microresonators; for reviews on this subject see e.g.<ref name=herr2015/><ref name=chembo2016/> They offer substantial potential for miniaturization and chip-scale photonic integration, as well as for power reduction. Today KFC generation is a mature field, and this technology has been applied to several areas, including coherent telecommunications, spectroscopy, atomic clocks as well as laser ranging and astrophysical spectrometer calibration.\n\nA key impetus to these developments has been the realization of Kerr cavity solitons in microresonators,<ref name=\"herr2014\" /> opening the possibility of utilizing Kerr cavity solitons in photonic integrated microresonators.\n\nThe longitudinal LLE ({{EquationNote|2}}) provides a spatio-temporal picture of the involved phenomena, but from the spectral viewpoint its solutions correspond to KFC. The link between the topic of optical KFC and the LLE was theoretically developed in.<ref name=\"herr2014\" /><ref name=\"matsko2011\" /><ref name=\"herr2013\" /><ref name=\"chembo2013\" /><ref name=\"coen2013\" /> These authors showed that the LLE ( or generalizations including higher order dispersion terms) is the model which describes the generation of KFC and is capable of predicting their properties when the system parameters are varied. The spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and solitons travelling along the cavity described by the LLE is the spatiotemporal equivalent of the frequency combs and governs their features. The rather idealized conditions assumed in the formulation of the LLE, especially the high-Q condition, have been perfectly materialized by the spectacular technological progress that has occurred in the meantime in the field of photonics and has led, in particular, to the discovery of KFC.\n\n== Quantum aspects ==\nThe two photons that, as shown in Fig.4, are emitted in symmetrically tilted directions in the FWM process, are in a state of ''[[quantum entanglement]]'': they are precisely correlated , for example in energy and momentum. This fact is fundamental for the quantum aspects of optical patterns. For instance, the difference between the intensities of the two symmetrical beams is squeezed, i.e. exhibits fluctuations below the shot noise level;<ref name=lugiato92/> the longitudinal analogue of this phenomenon has been observed experimentally in KFC.<ref name=dutt2015/> In turn, such quantum aspects are basic for the field of [[quantum imaging]].<ref name=gatti2008/><ref name=kolobov99/>\n\n== Review articles ==\nFor reviews on the subject of the LLE, see also.<ref name=lugiato2015/><ref name=castelli2017/><ref name=lugiato2018/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Four-wave mixing]] \n*[[Frequency comb]]\n*[[Kerr frequency comb]]\n*[[Nonlinear Schroedinger equation]]\n*[[Optical bistability]]\n*[[Pattern formation]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=lugiato87>{{cite journal\n |title=Spatial Dissipative Structures in Passive Optical Systems\n |last=Lugiato |first=L.A. \n |last2=Lefever |first2=R. \n |journal=Physical Review Letters\n |volume=58\n |issue=21\n |pages=2209\u20132211\n |year=1987\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.2209\n |pmid=10034681 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..58.2209L\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=turing52>{{cite journal\n |title=The chemical basis of morphogenesis\n |last=Turing |first=A.M.. \n |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences \n |volume=237\n |issue=641 |pages=37\u201372\n |year=1952\n |doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012\n |bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=prigogine77>{{cite book\n |title=Self-organization in nonequilibrium systems.

Povenmire is the co-creator of the Disney animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' and ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'', in which he also voiced the character [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] in both series. Povenmire grew up in [[Mobile, Alabama]], where he was an art student, and where he spent summers outdoors and making movies. Povenmire attended the [[University of South Alabama]] before deciding to pursue a film career and transferring to the [[University of Southern California]] School of Cinematic Arts.\n\nPovenmire has been a long-time contributor to the animation business, working on several different animated television series such as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. He was a longtime director on the prime time series ''[[Family Guy]],'' where he was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] in 2005. He left the series to create ''Phineas and Ferb'' with [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]]. Povenmire has been nominated for several awards for his work on the show, including a [[BAFTA]], an Annie, and an [[Emmy Award]]. Following the success of ''Phineas and Ferb'', he and Marsh created and produced a second show for Disney titled ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'', which premiered in 2016. The duo are currently at work on a second ''Phineas and Ferb'' movie.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Downtown Mobile 2008 01.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large city seen from the water on a clear day.

Abron ''hia'' vs. other Akan ''hyia'' (\"to meet\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Abron has [l] and [r] in free variation, where other Akan varieties have only /r/ or only /l/. As Akan generally has [d] in complementary distribution with [r], there are some Abron words with [l], [r], and [d] in free variation, e.g. ''fiela''/''fiera''/''fieda'' (\"Friday\"). A similar process may be found in some varieties of Asante, e.g. ''ak\u0254laa''/''ak\u0254raa''/''ak\u0254daa'' (\"child\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n* In most Akan dialects, the emphatic particle ''n\u00e0'' is pronounced with a low tone, whereas in Abron it is ''n\u00e9'', with a high tone.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Unlike other varieties of Akan, and most [[Kwa languages]] in general, which have nominal vowel prefixes, many Abron nouns have either a [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] nasal prefix or no nasal prefix at all: cf. Abron ''p\u0254nk\u0254'' vs. other Akan ''\u0254p\u0254nk\u0254'' (\"horse\"). Conversely, while most dialects have lost the nominal vowel suffix, Abron as well as Asante have retained it: cf. Bron ''nsuo'' vs. other Akan ''nsu'' (\"water\"). Asante is the only dialect to have retained both vowel prefix and suffix: cf. Abron ''wuo'', Asante ''owuo'', and other Akan ''owu'' (\"death\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Grammatical ====\n\n* The most characteristic feature of Abron is its use of the third-person plural pronoun ''b\u025b'', not found in any other Akan dialect. It was likely an old pronoun retained in Abron but not elsewhere in Akan.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Akan subject markers are usually only used when a subject is not made explicit, and are only ever used alongside an explicit subject in emphatic sentences. However, in Abron, an explicit subject is almost always used alongside a subject marker, whether the sentence is emphatic or not: cf. other Akan ''Kofi k\u0254e'' (\"Kofi went\", with explicit subject and without subject marker) and '''''\u0254'''k\u0254e'' (\"'''He''' went\", with subject marker) vs. Abron ''Kofi \u0254k\u0254e'' (literally \"Kofi he went\", with explicit subject and subject marker). Similarly, Abron requires a possessor as well as a possessive pronoun, e.g. ''Kofi ne dan'' (literally \"Kofi his house\"), although this is a feature found in Fante and Akuapem.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* In Abron, the first-person singular prefixes ''me-'' reduce to a homorganic syllabic nasal when they occur immediately before a consonant, e.g. '''''m'''b\u025b\u025b'' (\"I came\"), whereas other Akan dialects do not reduce it, e.g. '''''me'''bae'' (\"I came\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Abron does not distinguish the third-person singular animate ''\u0254-'' and inanimate ''\u025b-'' possessive prefixes common to other Akan dialects, instead using ''\u0254-'' (sometimes pronounced ''w\u0254-'') for both: cf. Abron ''\u0254k\u0254'' (\"he/she/it has gone\") vs. Akuapem ''\u0254k\u0254'' (\"he/she has gone\") and ''\u025bk\u0254'' (\"it has gone\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n=== Pronouns ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Independent\n!Subject\n!Possessive\n!Object\n|-\n!First sing.\n|me\n|me-\n|me-\n|m\n|-\n!Second sing.\n|wo\n|wo-\n|wo\n|w\n|-\n!Third sing.\n|\u0254no\n|w\u0254-\n|\u0254-; ne\n|no\n|-\n!First pl.\n|y\u025b\n|y\u025b-\n|y\u025b\n|y\u025b\n|-\n!Second pl.\n|h\u00f5\n|h\u00f5-\n|h\u00f5\n|h\u00f5\n|-\n!Third pl.\n|b\u025b\n|b\u025b-\n|b\u025b\n|b\u025b\n|-\n!Unspecified\n|\n|\u025b-\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{Languages of Ghana}}{{Kwa languages}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Languages of Ghana]]\n[[Category:Akan language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox language\n| name = Abron\n| states = [[Ghana]]\n| ethnicity = [[Abron tribe|Abron]]\n| speakers = {{sigfig|1.393|2}} million\n| date = 2013\n| ref = <ref>{{e22|aka|Akan}}</ref>\n| familycolor = Niger-Congo\n| fam2 = [[Atlantic\u2013Congo languages|Atlantic\u2013Congo]]\n| fam3 = [[Kwa languages|Kwa]]\n| fam4 = [[Potou\u2013Tano languages|Potou\u2013Tano]]\n| fam5 = [[Tano languages|Tano]]\n| fam6 = [[Central Tano languages|Central Tano (Akan)]]\n| fam7 = [[Akan language|Akan]]\n| iso3 = abr\n| glotto = abro1238\n| glottorefname = Abron\n| nation = Ghana\n| dia1 = Bono\n}}\n\n'''Abron''', also known as '''Brong''', '''Bron''', '''Doma''', and '''Gyaman''',<ref name=\":0\" /> is the common language of the [[Abron tribe|Abron people]] and a major [[dialect]] of the [[Akan language|Akan]] [[dialect continuum]], and thus [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with the three principal Akan dialects of [[Fante dialect|Fante]], [[Asante dialect|Asante]], and [[Akuapem dialect|Akuapem]], the latter two collectively known as [[Twi]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/aka|title=Akan|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2019-12-28}}</ref> It is spoken by 1.2 million in [[Ghana]], primarily in the Central Ghanaian region of [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]], and by over 300,000 in eastern [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Relationship with other dialects of Akan ==\nAbron is mutually intelligible with all dialects of Akan, but the degree of intelligibility depends on the geographical distance between the dialects.
