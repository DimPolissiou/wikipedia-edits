Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with [[B.B. King]] singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&M's; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&M's, where [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] sees the three M&M's, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.\n\nIn 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever \"M&M's Global Color Vote\" to add a new color from three choices: [[aqua (color)|aqua]] ([[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]), [[pink]], and [[purple]]. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue.

To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car).

From its inception as a bill the [[long title]] has been ''An Act to assent to alterations in the law touching the succession to the throne'' and the [[short title]] has been the ''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013''. As a bill, it consisted of a long preamble and three short provisions. The preamble outlined the monarch's powers as prescribed by the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', followed by a summary of the [[Perth Agreement]] and the quoted preamble of ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', which expressed the convention that an alteration of the succession rules be assented to by the respective parliaments of all Commonwealth realms. It ended with the acknowledgement of the introduction of the ''[[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|Succession to the Crown Bill 2012]]'' in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Clause 1 provided the [[short title]]; clause 2 stated that the alteration in the law touching the succession to the throne set out in the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012 as laid before the British parliament \"is assented to\"; and clause 3 allowed the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] to determine the effective date.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=5955606&File=24| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Bill C-53| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:SenatorElaineMcCoysitting.jpg|thumb|right|Senator [[Elaine McCoy]], who opposed Bill C-53]]\n\nThe wording of clause 2 of the bill was nearly identical to the similar section in the ''[[Succession to the Throne Act 1937]]'', passed by the Parliament of Canada to legislatively ratify the Canadian Cabinet's earlier consent to the taking into the laws of Canada of ''[[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]'', the act of the British parliament that effected [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|the abdication]] of [[Edward VIII]] as king of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the other [[Dominion]]s.

Fraser commented that when the Senate had given the bill third reading, she would take that as formal notification that assent was being given to the bill eventually passed in Westminster, but it would have been preferable if Canada had done as Australia and New Zealand were doing: instead of passing a bill to assent to another parliament's legislation, they were passing their own, standalone legislation, thereby asserting that the monarch of each country is whomever each country's laws determines it to be.<ref>{{cite hansard| jurisdiction=Canada| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/148db_2013-03-25-e.htm#27| house=Senate| date=25 March 2013| speaker=Joan Fraser| position=Senator}}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Serge Joyal]] responded by saying that Bill C-53 assented to the British bill by its title, not all its clauses.

In response, Chr\u00e9tien asserted that the schedule to the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', was not exhaustive, outlining that section 52(2) of the ''Constitution Act 1982'' says \u201c[t]he Constitution of Canada includes... the Acts and orders referred to the schedule\" and \"[w]hen you use the word 'includes'... it means that if ever there is another thing related to the Canadian constitution as part of it, should have been there, or might have been there, it is covered.

[The schedule] is not an exhaustive list.\"<ref name=committee/>\n\nThe government's stated position in 2013 was that \"The changes to the laws of succession do not require a constitutional amendment. The laws governing succession are UK law and are not part of Canada's constitution. Specifically, they are not enumerated in the schedule to our ''Constitution Act, 1982'' as part of the Constitution of Canada. Furthermore, the changes to the laws of succession do not constitute a change to the 'office of The Queen', as contemplated in ''the Constitution Act, 1982''. The 'office of The Queen' includes the Sovereign's constitutional status, powers and rights in Canada. Neither the ban on the marriages of heirs to Roman Catholics, nor the common law governing male preference primogeniture, can properly be said to be royal powers or prerogatives in Canada.

The Canadian parliament's subsequent Succession to the Throne Act 1937 (required only by convention outlined in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster) ratified the Cabinet's earlier action and contains the full text of ''His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act'', which itself outlines its effects on the ''Act of Settlement 1701'' and ''Royal Marriages Act 1772''. (Further proof of the existence of the Royal Marriages Act in Canadian law is, according to Toffoli, provided by the approval by the Queen in her Canadian Council in 1981 to the marriage of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] separately to the same approval given by the Queen in her British Council.<ref name=CPAC/>) Thus, Canada's Succession to the Throne Act 1937 \"is the statutory repository of the law of Succession for Canada\", meaning \"it is irrelevant whether or not [the succession laws are enumerated in the schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982], as [the laws] had already been [patriated] in 1937...\"<ref name=Toffoli3-4 /> Given the subsequent repeal of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster in Canada and the enactment of section 2 of the ''Canada Act, 1982'', the United Kingdom's ''Succession to the Crown Act 2012'' has no effect on Canada's succession laws, regardless of the Canadian parliament's assent to it.<ref name=CPAC/><ref>{{Harvnb| Toffoli| 2013| p=5}}</ref> He claimed the Canadian parliament could possibly alter Canada's succession laws simply by amending Schedule 2 of the 1937 act.

As a bill, it consisted of a long preamble and three short provisions. The preamble outlined the monarch's powers as prescribed by the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', followed by a summary of the [[Perth Agreement]] and the quoted preamble of ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', which expressed the convention that an alteration of the succession rules be assented to by the respective parliaments of all Commonwealth realms. It ended with the acknowledgement of the introduction of the ''[[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|Succession to the Crown Bill 2012]]'' in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Clause 1 provided the [[short title]]; clause 2 stated that the alteration in the law touching the succession to the throne set out in the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012 as laid before the British parliament \"is assented to\"; and clause 3 allowed the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] to determine the effective date.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=5955606&File=24| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Bill C-53| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:SenatorElaineMcCoysitting.jpg|thumb|right|Senator [[Elaine McCoy]], who opposed Bill C-53]]\n\nThe wording of clause 2 of the bill was nearly identical to the similar section in the ''[[Succession to the Throne Act 1937]]'', passed by the Parliament of Canada to legislatively ratify the Canadian Cabinet's earlier consent to the taking into the laws of Canada of ''[[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]'', the act of the British parliament that effected [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|the abdication]] of [[Edward VIII]] as king of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the other [[Dominion]]s.

The Canadian parliament's subsequent Succession to the Throne Act 1937 (required only by convention outlined in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster) ratified the Cabinet's earlier action and contains the full text of ''His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act'', which itself outlines its effects on the ''Act of Settlement 1701'' and ''Royal Marriages Act 1772''. (Further proof of the existence of the Royal Marriages Act in Canadian law is, according to Toffoli, provided by the approval by the Queen in her Canadian Council in 1981 to the marriage of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] separately to the same approval given by the Queen in her British Council.<ref name=CPAC/>) Thus, Canada's Succession to the Throne Act 1937 \"is the statutory repository of the law of Succession for Canada\", meaning \"it is irrelevant whether or not [the succession laws are enumerated in the schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982], as [the laws] had already been [patriated] in 1937...\"<ref name=Toffoli3-4 /> Given the subsequent repeal of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster in Canada and the enactment of section 2 of the ''Canada Act, 1982'', the United Kingdom's ''Succession to the Crown Act 2012'' has no effect on Canada's succession laws, regardless of the Canadian parliament's assent to it.<ref name=CPAC/><ref>{{Harvnb| Toffoli| 2013| p=5}}</ref> He claimed the Canadian parliament could possibly alter Canada's succession laws simply by amending Schedule 2 of the 1937 act.
