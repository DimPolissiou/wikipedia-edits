Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.<ref name=serano>Julia Serano. ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity'', Seal Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-58005-154-5|1-58005-154-5}}</ref>\n\nOther transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia, and especially of the forms that incite violence towards transsexual people, is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain's protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see [[transgender rights in Iran]]). The foundation for this accepting attitude is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual, thus making homosexuality a sin.

Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.<ref name=serano>Julia Serano.

These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see [[transgender rights in Iran]]). The foundation for this accepting attitude is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual, thus making homosexuality a sin.

Jorgensen, who made frequent [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:\n\n<blockquote>In 1953, for example, ''ONE'' magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a \"sweeping disservice\" to gay men. \"As far as the public knows,\" Winters wrote, \"you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it.\" For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine,\" which, he said, \"they are not.\" Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the \"reasoning\" that led \"to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment \u2013 and worse.\" In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.<ref name=\"mayerowitz2002\">Meyerowitz, Joanne (2002).

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

When their neighbor Mrs. Lynde calls her homely, skinny and redhaired, she loses her temper.

While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition. It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nReviews for the second season were mixed.

It was released on [[floppy disk]]s on March 4, 1991, and released on [[CD-ROM]] in December 1992 with full speech support and featuring ''[[Laugh-In]]'' announcer [[Gary Owens]] as the voice of the narrator. It featured 256-color hand painted graphics and a fully mouse-driven interface. It was one of the first games to use [[motion capture]] animation. The game cost over [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000,000 to produce and sold more than its three predecessors combined. An [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine, Sierra News Magazine, but was later canceled.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sierra Product Information: Atari ST |url=http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/interaction/010_sierra_news_magazine_volume_4_number_1_spring_1991.pdf |journal=Sierra News Magazine |volume=4 |issue=1 |publisher=Sierra On-Line |date=Spring 1991 |accessdate=7 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Owens]] &mdash; narrator\n*[[Jeff Bender]] &mdash; Roger Wilco\n*[[Stuart Moulder]] &mdash; Roger Jr.\n*[[Scott Murphy (video game designer)|Scott Murphy]] &mdash; Sludge Vohaul\n\n== Plot ==\nIn this installment, Roger embarks on a [[time travel|time-travel]] adventure through ''Space Quest'' games both past and future. An [[infomorph]] of reborn [[Sludge Vohaul]] from ''Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II'' chases Roger through time in an attempt to finally kill him. Roger also visits ''Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros'' (whose title is a parody of [[Infocom]]'s game ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'') and ''Space Quest I''; in the latter, the graphics and music revert to the style of the original game and Roger is threatened by a group of monochromatic bikers who consider Roger's 256 colors pretentious. None of the gameplay takes place in ''Space Quest IV''. In fact, the \"actual\" ''Space Quest IV'' is only seen briefly in the introduction.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn contrast to the first three games, ''Space Quest IV'' uses a [[point-and-click]] interface, featuring icons for different actions. The icons are an eye, a talking head, a walking person, a hand, a mouth, and a nose, representing ''look'', ''talk'', ''walk to'', ''use'', ''taste'', and ''smell'', respectively. The last two almost never do anything other than provoke a humorous response from the game.\n\n=== ''Ms. Astro Chicken'' ===\n''Ms. Astro Chicken: Flight of the Pullet'' is a video game embedded within the ''Latex Babes of Estros'' portion of the game, in a mall arcade. It is a sequel of sorts to ''Astro Chicken'', an arcade game that appeared in ''[[Space Quest III]]''. The game's name is a parody of the actual arcade game ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. The Astro Chicken theme music is a variation on the [[Chicken Reel]], a traditional folk song best known for its use in animated cartoons.\n\nIn the game, the player controls a flying chicken, whose enemies include [[flying squirrel]]s, [[windpump]]s, shotgun-wielding hunters and hunting dogs. Dropping eggs on enemies immobilizes them and increases the player's score. After playing the game for a while, the arcade cabinet explodes, though this has no effect on the player or broader game.\n\n=== Copy protection ===\nOriginally, the time pod codes could only be found in the manual as a form of [[copy protection]]. In later releases, the codes were added to the game.\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the ''Space Quest'' series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996.<ref name=sierrasales>{{cite report | date = March 31, 1996 | title = Sierra On-Line Form 10-K |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416004925/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | archivedate=April 16, 2018 | location=[[Bellevue, Washington]] | pages=7\u20139 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"Dragon173\">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Dragon |issue=173 |date=September 1991 |pages=55\u201360}}</ref> In 1992, they gave the [[Macintosh]] version of the game 5 out of 5 stars as well.<ref name=\"Dragon179\">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Dragon |issue=179 |date=March 1992 |pages=57\u201362}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Charles Ardai]] stated in 1993 that \"the CD-ROM version is even more filling than the original.

While noting that the CD-ROM did not change the brevity of the gameplay, Ardai added that \"there are better adventure games than ''Space Quest IV'' [but] there are few games that are more entertaining.

It was released on [[floppy disk]]s on March 4, 1991, and released on [[CD-ROM]] in December 1992 with full speech support and featuring ''[[Laugh-In]]'' announcer [[Gary Owens]] as the voice of the narrator. It featured 256-color hand painted graphics and a fully mouse-driven interface. It was one of the first games to use [[motion capture]] animation. The game cost over [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000,000 to produce and sold more than its three predecessors combined. An [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine, Sierra News Magazine, but was later canceled.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sierra Product Information: Atari ST |url=http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/interaction/010_sierra_news_magazine_volume_4_number_1_spring_1991.pdf |journal=Sierra News Magazine |volume=4 |issue=1 |publisher=Sierra On-Line |date=Spring 1991 |accessdate=7 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Owens]] &mdash; narrator\n*[[Jeff Bender]] &mdash; Roger Wilco\n*[[Stuart Moulder]] &mdash; Roger Jr.\n*[[Scott Murphy (video game designer)|Scott Murphy]] &mdash; Sludge Vohaul\n\n== Plot ==\nIn this installment, Roger embarks on a [[time travel|time-travel]] adventure through ''Space Quest'' games both past and future. An [[infomorph]] of reborn [[Sludge Vohaul]] from ''Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II'' chases Roger through time in an attempt to finally kill him. Roger also visits ''Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros'' (whose title is a parody of [[Infocom]]'s game ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'') and ''Space Quest I''; in the latter, the graphics and music revert to the style of the original game and Roger is threatened by a group of monochromatic bikers who consider Roger's 256 colors pretentious. None of the gameplay takes place in ''Space Quest IV''. In fact, the \"actual\" ''Space Quest IV'' is only seen briefly in the introduction.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn contrast to the first three games, ''Space Quest IV'' uses a [[point-and-click]] interface, featuring icons for different actions. The icons are an eye, a talking head, a walking person, a hand, a mouth, and a nose, representing ''look'', ''talk'', ''walk to'', ''use'', ''taste'', and ''smell'', respectively. The last two almost never do anything other than provoke a humorous response from the game.\n\n=== ''Ms. Astro Chicken'' ===\n''Ms. Astro Chicken: Flight of the Pullet'' is a video game embedded within the ''Latex Babes of Estros'' portion of the game, in a mall arcade. It is a sequel of sorts to ''Astro Chicken'', an arcade game that appeared in ''[[Space Quest III]]''. The game's name is a parody of the actual arcade game ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. The Astro Chicken theme music is a variation on the [[Chicken Reel]], a traditional folk song best known for its use in animated cartoons.\n\nIn the game, the player controls a flying chicken, whose enemies include [[flying squirrel]]s, [[windpump]]s, shotgun-wielding hunters and hunting dogs. Dropping eggs on enemies immobilizes them and increases the player's score. After playing the game for a while, the arcade cabinet explodes, though this has no effect on the player or broader game.\n\n=== Copy protection ===\nOriginally, the time pod codes could only be found in the manual as a form of [[copy protection]]. In later releases, the codes were added to the game.\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the ''Space Quest'' series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996.<ref name=sierrasales>{{cite report | date = March 31, 1996 | title = Sierra On-Line Form 10-K |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416004925/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | archivedate=April 16, 2018 | location=[[Bellevue, Washington]] | pages=7\u20139 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"Dragon173\">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Dragon |issue=173 |date=September 1991 |pages=55\u201360}}</ref> In 1992, they gave the [[Macintosh]] version of the game 5 out of 5 stars as well.<ref name=\"Dragon179\">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Dragon |issue=179 |date=March 1992 |pages=57\u201362}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Charles Ardai]] stated in 1993 that \"the CD-ROM version is even more filling than the original.

Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his [[Commando 2|previous mission]]. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent  have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan. \n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* Abhilash Chaudhary as Taimur Khan\n* Manuj Sharma as Subhan\n* Raghav Dheer as Umar\n* Prashant Jha as Usman\n* Mark Bennington as Alvin\n* Atharva Vishwakarma as Abeer\n* R.

Karanveer Singh Dogra \"Karan\" is called to help the police but one of the suspects kills himself. Upon investigating further, Karan learns the suspects received money and VHS tapes containing a terrorist's message. Also, one of the suspects talks repeatedly about 9/11, which is decoded as an attack on India on the day of Diwali. Further learning the recordings were shot by a camera in London, Karan decides to go undercover along with Bhavana Reddy, who assisted him on his [[Commando 2|previous mission]]. Posing as a married couple, they arrive in London where Mallika Sood, a British Intelligence officer picks them up and takes them to their work station where another agent named Armaan Akhtar assists them. On the other hand, the British Muslim terrorist Buraq Ansari forces his son Abeer to watch him killing a man, due to which Abeer's mother and Buraq's ex wife Zahira wants to contact the police but is threatened by Buraq. Learning two Indian agent  have arrived in London possibly to capture him, Buraq enlists the help of his agents to track them while Karan and his team go through the same process to track Buraq's agents. While pursuing a suspect, Karan meets Zahira and Abeer, and soon gets involved in a bike chase with the suspect, resulting in the latter's accidental death. Karan retrieves his phone and answers Buraq's call, further telling him he would soon visit the dead suspect's house. Karan and team arrive at the house, but outside it are stopped by Buraq's goons. A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan. \n\nIt is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \"ALLAH\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When the good Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Karan)\n* [[Adah Sharma]] as Agent Bhavana Reddy \n* [[Angira Dhar]] as British Intelligence Agent Mallika Sood \n* [[Gulshan Devaiah]] as Buraq Ansari\n* Sumeet Thakur as British Intelligence Agent Armaan Akhtar\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Roy\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Ahmed\n* [[Vibhawari Deshpande]] as Rajani\n* [[Feryna Wazheir]] as Zahira\n* Suresh Vishwakarma as Inspector Tambe\n* Abhilash Chaudhary as Taimur Khan\n* Manuj Sharma as Subhan\n* Raghav Dheer as Umar\n* Prashant Jha as Usman\n* Mark Bennington as Alvin\n* Atharva Vishwakarma as Abeer\n* R.

(also known simply as '''''King's Quest V''''') is a 1990 [[graphic adventure game]] by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]. Originally released in November 1990, it featured a significant improvement in graphics (achieved through the introduction of [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] into the series). It was also the first ''[[King's Quest]]'' installment to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. The title is a spoof on the proverb \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"\n\n''King's Quest V'' sold over half million copies and won several awards. It was later released as a fully voiced \"talkie\" [[CD-ROM]], done by members of the Sierra staff. By summer a [[Sega CD]] port of the game was announced, but was never released.<ref name=\"KQ5-SegaCD\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mega Play - Coming Attractions |url=https://archive.org/details/Mega_Play_Issue_11_August_1992/page/n31 |magazine=[[Mega (magazine)#Mega Play|Mega Play]] |volume=3 |issue=11 |publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=August 1992 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the introduction to the game, a view of Castle Daventry is shown, when suddenly, a mysterious cloaked figure appears. He enchants the castle, causing a whirlwind to appear, which soon engulfs the castle and lifts it out of sight. Because he is out walking when this happens, [[King Graham]] is the only member of the royal family to be left behind. He returns to the castle to find that it has disappeared, and is soon confronted by a talking owl named Cedric.\n\nCedric witnessed the cloaked figure's attack, and tells Graham that it was a powerful, evil wizard named Mordack who stole the castle. Cedric then brings Graham to the land of Serenia, where his master Crispin resides. Crispin is also a wizard, but a good one, who gives Graham some advice, his old wand, and a piece of white snake which allows Graham to speak with animals. Graham then starts on his journey.\n\nLater, Graham learns that Mordack is the brother of the wizard Manannan, whom Graham's son, Prince Alexander, turned into a cat in ''[[King's Quest III]]''. Mordack has imprisoned the castle and royal family of Daventry out of revenge, and threatens to feed the royal family to Manannan unless Prince Alexander agrees to restore him to his true form as the spell's nature means that only Prince Alexander as the caster can reverse it. King Graham travels through the land of Serenia, gathering helpful items and information, and eventually makes his way to Mordack's island, and to his castle lair, to save his family from their impending doom.\n\nThe owl Cedric accompanies the protagonist King Graham through the entire game to provide commentary and advice. He has to be rescued from danger at several points. The only useful thing the owl does is inadvertently saving Graham's life from a spell near the end of the game.\n\nAt the end of the game, with the help of another of Mordack's prisoners, Princess Cassima, Graham is able to confront Mordack in a magical duel, using spells he learns from Mordack's own spell book against him. After Mordack transforms himself into a ring of fire, Graham slays the evil wizard by conjuring a rain storm to put the fire out. The good wizard Crispin arrives soon after and transforms the castle and royal family back to normal. At Graham's request, Crispin teleports Cassima back to her home in the Land of the Green Isles and sends the royal family back to Daventry.\n\n===Connections to other ''King's Quest'' games===\nThough still largely standalone, ''King's Quest V'' is one of the few where the elements of the plot itself are directly connected to events or individuals in both previous and future games. The location the game is set in, Serenia, was first visited in the earlier game ''[[Wizard and the Princess]]''. During the game, King Graham discovers the skeleton of a man in the Serenia desert which is identified as the body of the Wanderer, the protagonist from ''Wizard and the Princess'' in the King's Quest Companion. The transformation of Manannan into a cat is a necessary task to completing ''[[King's Quest III]]''. And this act has profound consequences for Alexander (and his family), as it is the impetus for the ''KQV'' storyline.\n\nThe game's ending ties into its sequel, ''[[King's Quest VI]]''. Cassima was introduced as a slave to the wizard Mordack. Before she is sent home at the end, Alexander mentions wanting to visit her in the Land of the Green Isles, which happens at the beginning of ''KQVI''. And Cassima mentions her [[Vizier]], who first introduced Mordack to her. In ''KQVI'', we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of ''KQVI'') are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.\n\n==Versions==\n''King's Quest V'' was the last in the series to feature [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Tandy graphics]] at 320\u00d7200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320\u00d7200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320\u00d7200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter|SCI]] games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640\u00d7200 resolution on EGA cards).\n\n===Floppy disk===\nThe diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).\n\n===CD-ROM===\nReleased in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the [[High Sierra Format]], unrelated to the [[Sierra Entertainment|publisher's name]]. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.\n\n===NES===\nIn order to make the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by [[Konami]], rather than [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]].<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> One example is Graham's water-drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\" This was edited due to religious themes.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.\n\n===Atari ST===\nAn [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled.<ref name=\"Staff (Spring 1991).

In ''KQVI'', we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of ''KQVI'') are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.\n\n==Versions==\n''King's Quest V'' was the last in the series to feature [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Tandy graphics]] at 320\u00d7200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320\u00d7200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320\u00d7200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter|SCI]] games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640\u00d7200 resolution on EGA cards).\n\n===Floppy disk===\nThe diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).\n\n===CD-ROM===\nReleased in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the [[High Sierra Format]], unrelated to the [[Sierra Entertainment|publisher's name]]. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.\n\n===NES===\nIn order to make the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by [[Konami]], rather than [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]].<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> One example is Graham's water-drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\" This was edited due to religious themes.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.\n\n===Atari ST===\nAn [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled.<ref name=\"Staff (Spring 1991).
