The Harrisons are among four families to have two presidents in their number with the same surname; the others are the [[Adams political family|Adams]], [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelt]], and [[Bush family|Bush]] families.{{efn|While presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] share a surname, no familial connection is known.}} The family's lineage also includes state governors, legislators, mayors, and professionals.\n\nThe Virginia Harrison family consists primarily of two branches with origins in northern England. One  branch, led by Benjamin Harrison I, journeyed by way of Bermuda to [[Virginia]] before 1633 and settled on the [[James River]]; they are often referred to as the James River Harrisons. Successive generations of this branch served in the legislature of the [[Colony of Virginia]], including Benjamin V, who was a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and later governor of the commonwealth. This family branch produced President William Henry Harrison, Benjamin V's son, and President Benjamin Harrison, William Henry's grandson, as well as another [[List of Governors of Virginia|Virginia governor]], [[Albertis Harrison]]; the family also includes two Chicago mayors and members of the U. S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe second branch of the Virginia Harrisons emigrated from Britain to New England in 1687 and settled in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia 50 years later; they were led by Isaiah Harrison. This branch most likely descended from an interim chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]], Rev. Thomas Harrison, who was kindred to the James River Harrisons but who returned to England. President Abraham Lincoln descended from the Shenandoah Valley family, which also includes the founders of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] and [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]].

Harrisons settled in [[Northumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[Durham, England|Durham]], all in the northernmost region of England. Some in their number used the older spelling \"Harryson\" (\"son of Harry\"), although this mostly ended with their arrival in the New World.<ref>Harrison, J.

They feature helmets and shields emblazoned by gold eagles on a dark field with supporters. The arms of William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) of the James River Harrisons depict three eagles and are mentioned in the arms of \"Harrison of the North\", granted in England in 1574, as well as those of \"Harrison of London\", granted in 1613 with a pedigree dating from 1374. They are often referred to as the \"Yorkshire arms\".<ref>Harrison, J.

Included is the crest shoulder ''gules'' (red) signaling strength or martyrdom. These arms were first established by the pedigree of Robert Harrison in 1630, showing him to be the grandson of Rowland Harrison of [[Barnard Castle (castle)|Barnard Castle]] in Durham.<ref>Harrison, J.

He led a parish at [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] at age 21, and was appointed by Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] as an acting chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]].<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 88.</ref>\n\n===Rev. Thomas Harrison===\nThomas earned his B.A. from [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] in 1638, then sailed to Virginia in 1640.<ref name=Cambridge/> He became a Puritan and left his parishes and his chaplaincy at Jamestown following the 1644 Indian Massacre there. He moved to Boston near his brothers, married Dorothy Symonds, and later repatriated to England. In 1650, he had a parish at St. Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and joined the English Puritans. In 1655, then a widower, he became the Chaplain for [[Henry Cromwell]], accompanied him to Ireland, and there resided with the Governor and his family.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n\nThomas also formed a close friendship with famed author and cleric, Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]]. Taylor biographer [[Edmund Gosse]] indicated that Thomas \"was rewarded by Governor Cromwell's confidence, and his advice was often asked for and acted upon. When in 1658 he published his extremely popular manual of piety, ''Topica Sacra'', he was the most popular divine in Ireland.\"<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/> ''Topica Sacra'' publicized Thomas as a robust and forceful cleric of his time. In an age of piety, the book invokes [[Job (biblical figure)|Job's]] insistence upon God's answers. Thomas was likewise notably confrontational in his prayers and, according to Gosse, was willing to \"catechize\" God for insight into His words. Thomas\u2019 work was dedicated to Cromwell and was reprinted on its centennial.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n \nIn 1659, he married Katherine Bradshaw and resided in [[Chester, England]]. He later settled in Dublin and probably fathered a son named Isaiah in 1666, who was the patriarch of the Virginia Harrisons of the Shenandoah Valley. Thomas died in Dublin in 1682.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\nJ. Houston Harrison cites historian John Peyton who contended that the Valley Harrisons instead descended from Major General [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] (1616\u20131660) who was born in the same year as the Reverend and whose wife was also named Katherine. The General participated in the regicide of King [[Charles I of England]], and was therefore [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in 1660. The Reverend's position as a non-conformist would have made them allies concerning the monarchy, which adds to the confusion of their identities. But no record is found at the [[College of Arms|Herald's College]] showing a pedigree and succeeding coat of arms for the General's family, as in the case of the Reverend. Also, no other lineage to the General has been adequately shown, and the notion is therefore discredited.<ref name=Harrison10>Harrison, J.

Thomas' use of the name Isaiah for his son was highly atypical\u2014the name is otherwise non-existent in family records to that time. However the name was quite in keeping with Puritan and non-conformist beliefs with which Thomas identified.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 99.</ref>{{efn|Though Thomas' last will and testament of 1682 makes no mention of Isaiah, it omits as well his eldest son Thomas, born in Chester in 1661.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>}}\n\nIsaiah may well have sailed from Dublin for New York in 1687, on the ship ''The Spotted Calf''. His departure, following his father's death, was also a timely consequence of his father's position as a non-conformist. Isaiah Harrison is definitively shown at [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] on Long Island in 1687\u2014this is the very same area from which his father Thomas had departed on his return to England forty years earlier.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 89\u201393.</ref> The family of Richard Harrison lived just across [[Long Island Sound]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Richard arrived in Connecticut in 1644 and was Isaiah's uncle. John Harrison is shown in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in 1685, and Samuel at [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester, New York]] in 1688.<ref name=Harrison10/> There are records in Dublin which show Thomas' consistent and very unique spelling of Harrison with the double \"s\", not otherwise found in Ireland or England.

The family lived at Oyster Bay for 14 years, then moved to [[Smithtown, New York]] near the [[Nissequogue River]] on Long Island, and remained for 19 years. They moved to [[Sussex County, Delaware]] in 1721, where Isaiah acquired the Maiden Plantation near the town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], and daughter Abigail married Alexander Herring (1708\u20131780).<ref>Harrison, J.

The Harrisons are among four families to have two presidents in their number with the same surname; the others are the [[Adams political family|Adams]], [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelt]], and [[Bush family|Bush]] families.{{efn|While presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] share a surname, no familial connection is known.}} The family's lineage also includes state governors, legislators, mayors, and professionals.\n\nThe Virginia Harrison family consists primarily of two branches with origins in northern England. One  branch, led by Benjamin Harrison I, journeyed by way of Bermuda to [[Virginia]] before 1633 and settled on the [[James River]]; they are often referred to as the James River Harrisons. Successive generations of this branch served in the legislature of the [[Colony of Virginia]], including Benjamin V, who was a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and later governor of the commonwealth. This family branch produced President William Henry Harrison, Benjamin V's son, and President Benjamin Harrison, William Henry's grandson, as well as another [[List of Governors of Virginia|Virginia governor]], [[Albertis Harrison]]; the family also includes two Chicago mayors and members of the U. S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe second branch of the Virginia Harrisons emigrated from Britain to New England in 1687 and settled in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia 50 years later; they were led by Isaiah Harrison. This branch most likely descended from an interim chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]], Rev. Thomas Harrison, who was kindred to the James River Harrisons but who returned to England. President Abraham Lincoln descended from the Shenandoah Valley family, which also includes the founders of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] and [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]]. This branch as well produced local officials, educators, and physicians, who made contributions in the areas of linguistics, women's advocacy, and groundbreaking transplant surgery.\n\n==English origin==\nSome genealogists indicate that the first Harrisons were [[Viking]] warriors of Norse origin, and that they arrived in England with [[Cnut the Great]]; others say that they are of Norman, Irish, and Scottish descent.  Harrisons settled in [[Northumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[Durham, England|Durham]], all in the northernmost region of England. Some in their number used the older spelling \"Harryson\" (\"son of Harry\"), although this mostly ended with their arrival in the New World.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nThe two Virginia Harrison lines share similar coats of arms, both issued in [[English heraldry]]. They feature helmets and shields emblazoned by gold eagles on a dark field with supporters. The arms of William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) of the James River Harrisons depict three eagles and are mentioned in the arms of \"Harrison of the North\", granted in England in 1574, as well as those of \"Harrison of London\", granted in 1613 with a pedigree dating from 1374. They are often referred to as the \"Yorkshire arms\".<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe \"Durham arms\" were used by Daniel Harrison of the Shenandoah Valley Harrisons, featuring one eagle and sourced to Harrisons descended from Durham. Included is the crest shoulder ''gules'' (red) signaling strength or martyrdom. These arms were first established by the pedigree of Robert Harrison in 1630, showing him to be the grandson of Rowland Harrison of [[Barnard Castle (castle)|Barnard Castle]] in Durham.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 80\u201383.</ref>\n\n==James River family==\n[[File:Berkeley plantation harrison home.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Berkeley Plantation]],<br/>homestead of the James River Harrisons]]\nThe history of the James River Harrisons in the [[Colony of Virginia]] began in 1630 when Benjamin Harrison I left England for America by way of Bermuda.<ref name=Smith>Smith</ref>  Author J.

He led a parish at [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] at age 21, and was appointed by Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] as an acting chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]].<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 88.</ref>\n\n===Rev. Thomas Harrison===\nThomas earned his B.A. from [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] in 1638, then sailed to Virginia in 1640.<ref name=Cambridge/> He became a Puritan and left his parishes and his chaplaincy at Jamestown following the 1644 Indian Massacre there. He moved to Boston near his brothers, married Dorothy Symonds, and later repatriated to England. In 1650, he had a parish at St. Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and joined the English Puritans. In 1655, then a widower, he became the Chaplain for [[Henry Cromwell]], accompanied him to Ireland, and there resided with the Governor and his family.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n\nThomas also formed a close friendship with famed author and cleric, Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]]. Taylor biographer [[Edmund Gosse]] indicated that Thomas \"was rewarded by Governor Cromwell's confidence, and his advice was often asked for and acted upon. When in 1658 he published his extremely popular manual of piety, ''Topica Sacra'', he was the most popular divine in Ireland.\"<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/> ''Topica Sacra'' publicized Thomas as a robust and forceful cleric of his time. In an age of piety, the book invokes [[Job (biblical figure)|Job's]] insistence upon God's answers. Thomas was likewise notably confrontational in his prayers and, according to Gosse, was willing to \"catechize\" God for insight into His words. Thomas\u2019 work was dedicated to Cromwell and was reprinted on its centennial.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n \nIn 1659, he married Katherine Bradshaw and resided in [[Chester, England]]. He later settled in Dublin and probably fathered a son named Isaiah in 1666, who was the patriarch of the Virginia Harrisons of the Shenandoah Valley. Thomas died in Dublin in 1682.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\nJ. Houston Harrison cites historian John Peyton who contended that the Valley Harrisons instead descended from Major General [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] (1616\u20131660) who was born in the same year as the Reverend and whose wife was also named Katherine. The General participated in the regicide of King [[Charles I of England]], and was therefore [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in 1660. The Reverend's position as a non-conformist would have made them allies concerning the monarchy, which adds to the confusion of their identities. But no record is found at the [[College of Arms|Herald's College]] showing a pedigree and succeeding coat of arms for the General's family, as in the case of the Reverend. Also, no other lineage to the General has been adequately shown, and the notion is therefore discredited.<ref name=Harrison10>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 10\u201315.</ref>\n\n===Isaiah and another president===\n[[File:Daniel Harrison House in Dayton.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Daniel Harrison House]], homestead of Daniel Harrison in Dayton, Virginia]]\n\nThe strongest evidence (though circumstantial for lack of a birth record) is that Reverend Thomas Harrison was the father of Isaiah Harrison (1666\u20131738), who was born in Dublin at the time of Thomas' residence and marriage there. Thomas' use of the name Isaiah for his son was highly atypical\u2014the name is otherwise non-existent in family records to that time. However the name was quite in keeping with Puritan and non-conformist beliefs with which Thomas identified.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 99.</ref>{{efn|Though Thomas' last will and testament of 1682 makes no mention of Isaiah, it omits as well his eldest son Thomas, born in Chester in 1661.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>}}\n\nIsaiah may well have sailed from Dublin for New York in 1687, on the ship ''The Spotted Calf''. His departure, following his father's death, was also a timely consequence of his father's position as a non-conformist. Isaiah Harrison is definitively shown at [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] on Long Island in 1687\u2014this is the very same area from which his father Thomas had departed on his return to England forty years earlier.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 89\u201393.</ref> The family of Richard Harrison lived just across [[Long Island Sound]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Richard arrived in Connecticut in 1644 and was Isaiah's uncle. John Harrison is shown in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in 1685, and Samuel at [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester, New York]] in 1688.<ref name=Harrison10/> There are records in Dublin which show Thomas' consistent and very unique spelling of Harrison with the double \"s\", not otherwise found in Ireland or England. Isaiah and his children utilized this same spelling in their American court records.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, p. 99.</ref><ref>Hood, p. 449.</ref>\n\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Harrison descendant, President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nIsaiah's first wife was Elizabeth Wright, with whom he had five children: Isaiah (b.1689), John (1691\u20131771), Gideon (1694\u20131729), Mary (1696\u20131781), and Elizabeth (b.1698). Wife Elizabeth died shortly after the birth of her youngest. Isaiah married Abigail Smith in 1700 and they had five  children:{{efn|J. Houston Harrison's reference to Abigail's maiden name of Smith indicates an uncertainty but no detail is offered.}} Daniel (1701\u20131770), Thomas (1704\u20131785), Jeremiah (1707\u20131777), Abigail (1710\u20131780), and Samuel (1712\u20131790). The family lived at Oyster Bay for 14 years, then moved to [[Smithtown, New York]] near the [[Nissequogue River]] on Long Island, and remained for 19 years. They moved to [[Sussex County, Delaware]] in 1721, where Isaiah acquired the Maiden Plantation near the town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], and daughter Abigail married Alexander Herring (1708\u20131780).<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 42\u201355, 123.</ref>\n\nThe Harrison family moved to the Valley of Virginia in 1737 via [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and camped in the [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]] area while waiting for their land grants to be finalized. Isaiah died in 1738 and was buried on the banks of the [[Shenandoah River]]. Son Daniel made the family's first Virginia land acquisition in 1739 in [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]], and he and brother Thomas founded the towns of [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]] and [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] respectively.<ref name=Harrison10/> Brother John settled at Great Spring, and Samuel settled at nearby [[Linville, Virginia|Linville]]. Daniel used the \"Durham arms\" as his seal for the legal documents in Rockingham.<ref>Harrison, J.

Their daughter Bathsheba (1742\u20131836) married Captain [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Abraham Lincoln]] (1744\u20131786), also of Linville, and they had son Thomas (1778\u20131851) who married Nancy Hanks (1783\u20131818).<ref name=Wayland>Wayland, John W., pp. 24\u201357.</ref><ref name=HarrisonAL>Harrison, J.

As Crafton lay dying of his wounds, he confessed to Cartwright that he was responsible for provoking Harrison. Lincoln called Cartwright to testify as to the confession but the judge initially denied it as inadmissible hearsay. Lincoln succeeded in obtaining an acquittal after arguing with the judge, to the point of risking contempt, but ultimately convincing him to admit the testimony and confession as a [[dying declaration]].<ref name=Dekle/>\n\n===Local officials, politicians, educators, and physicians===\n[[File:Prof. Gessner Harrison.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Univ. of Va.

He was highly regarded in the classics and linguistics, and served as faculty chairman. The devout Gessner is also remembered for declining [[Thomas Jefferson]]\u2019s invitation to Sunday dinner at [[Monticello]], saying it would represent a desecration of the sabbath.

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on January&nbsp;11, 1988. This was the second writing credit of the series for [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] following the episode \"[[Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Haven]]\". [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] planned to direct the episode, but he was switched to \"[[Datalore]]\" due to delays in its production. With Bowman working on another episode, [[Joseph L. Scanlan]] became the director.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, the crew is sent to open diplomatic ties with the Jarada. While taking a break from preparations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]), and Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) are trapped, due to a computer malfunction, in a 1940s-style gangster [[holodeck]] program with Captain Picard playing the role of [[detective]] Dixon Hill.\n\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is the first episode to significantly feature the holodeck. Torm\u00e9 credited [[Gene Roddenberry]] with the idea for the detective novel, with Torm\u00e9 employing the [[film noir]] style using references to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941). [[Lawrence Tierney]], who appeared in film noir movies in the 1940s, guest stars as Cyrus Redblock. The Dixon Hill setting reappeared in two later episodes in the series and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996).\n\n11.5&nbsp;million viewers watched \"The Big Goodbye\"; critical reception was mixed. One reviewer found it too similar to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]\". Other reviewers complained about the holodeck but praised Tierney's performance. The episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series|Outstanding Costumes for a Series]] and is the only ''Star Trek'' episode to ever win the [[Peabody Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] heads to Torona IV to open negotiations with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes that Cyrus Redblock ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen ([[David Selburg]]) to join him in the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover that Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. Bell ([[William Boyett]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew tries to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but finds it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems. While inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears, having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled, as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover that the holodeck is malfunctioning, and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

However, the name was changed due to similarities with the name of the title character in the American television series ''[[Remington Steele]]''. The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on January&nbsp;11, 1988. This was the second writing credit of the series for [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] following the episode \"[[Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Haven]]\". [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] planned to direct the episode, but he was switched to \"[[Datalore]]\" due to delays in its production. With Bowman working on another episode, [[Joseph L. Scanlan]] became the director.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, the crew is sent to open diplomatic ties with the Jarada. While taking a break from preparations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]), and Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) are trapped, due to a computer malfunction, in a 1940s-style gangster [[holodeck]] program with Captain Picard playing the role of [[detective]] Dixon Hill.\n\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is the first episode to significantly feature the holodeck. Torm\u00e9 credited [[Gene Roddenberry]] with the idea for the detective novel, with Torm\u00e9 employing the [[film noir]] style using references to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941). [[Lawrence Tierney]], who appeared in film noir movies in the 1940s, guest stars as Cyrus Redblock. The Dixon Hill setting reappeared in two later episodes in the series and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996).\n\n11.5&nbsp;million viewers watched \"The Big Goodbye\"; critical reception was mixed. One reviewer found it too similar to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]\". Other reviewers complained about the holodeck but praised Tierney's performance. The episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series|Outstanding Costumes for a Series]] and is the only ''Star Trek'' episode to ever win the [[Peabody Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] heads to Torona IV to open negotiations with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes that Cyrus Redblock ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen ([[David Selburg]]) to join him in the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover that Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. Bell ([[William Boyett]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew tries to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but finds it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems. While inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears, having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled, as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover that the holodeck is malfunctioning, and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.

These were the result of [[Soviet Union]] policy that was ratified by its Allies. Similarly the Soviet Union had enforced policy between 1939 and 1941, that targeted and expelled ethnic Poles residing in the Soviet zone of occupation following the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]]. The second wave of expulsions resulted from the retaking of Poland by the [[Red Army]] during the Soviet counter-offensive. It took over [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|territory for its republic of Ukraine]], a shift that was ratified at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union's then Allies of the West.\n\nThe postwar population transfers, targeting Polish nationals, were part of an official Soviet policy that affected more than one million Polish citizens, who were removed in stages from the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. After the war, following Soviet demands laid out during the [[Tehran Conference]] of 1943, the [[Kresy]] macroregion was formally incorporated into the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian [[Republics of the Soviet Union]]. This was agreed at the [[Potsdam Conference]] of Allies in 1945, to which the acting Government of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Republic of Poland in exile]] was not invited.<ref name=\"Gren\">{{cite book |title=A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century |author=John A.S.

The Polish transfers were among the largest of several [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|post-war expulsions]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], which displaced a total of about twenty million people.\n\nAccording to official data, during the state-controlled expulsion between 1945 and 1946, roughly 1,167,000 Poles left the westernmost republics of the Soviet Union, less than 50% of those who registered for population transfer.

Social and ethnic conflicts arose regarding the differences in religious practices between the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] adherents during the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595-96, when the Metropolitan of Kiev-Halych broke relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and accepted the authority of the Roman Catholic Pope and Vatican.<ref name=\"Dvornik1962\">{{cite book |last=Dvornik |first=Francis |year=1962 |title=The Slavs in European history and civilization |url=https://archive.org/details/slavsineuropeanh0000dvor_f9h0 |url-access=registration |edition=3 |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813507996 |page=[https://archive.org/details/slavsineuropeanh0000dvor_f9h0/page/347 347]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[partitions of Poland]], toward the end of the 18th century, resulted in the expulsions of ethnic Poles from their homes in the east for the first time in the history of the nation.

In the region of [[Podolia]] in 1917, there were 290 Polish schools.\n\nBeginning in 1920, the Bolshevik and nationalist terror campaigns of the new war triggered the flight of Poles and Jews from Soviet Russia to newly sovereign Poland. In 1922 Bolshevik Russian [[Red Army]], with their Bolshevik allies in Ukraine overwhelmed the government of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], including the annexed Ukrainian territories into the [[Soviet Union]].

This was also the time of his purges of different classes of peoples, many of whom were killed. Poles were expelled from the border regions in order to resettle the area with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, but Stalin had them deported to the far reaches of Siberia and Central Asia. In 1935 alone 1,500 families were deported to Siberia from the Soviet Ukraine. In 1936, 5,000 Polish families were deported to [[Kazakhstan]]. The deportations were accompanied by the gradual elimination of Polish cultural institutions. Polish-language newspapers were closed, as were Polish-language classes throughout Ukraine.\n\nSoon after the wave of deportations, the Soviet NKVD orchestrated the [[Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union]].

The [[Polish government in exile]] in London affirmed its position of retaining the 1939 borders. [[Nikita Khrushchev]], however, approached Stalin personally to keep the territories gained through the illegal and secret Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under continued Soviet occupation.\n\n{{quote|The residents of the Western Ukraine and Byelorussia, as well as those of the Wilno district, which had been annexed to the Soviet Union under the Ribentrop-Molotov pact of 23 August and 28 September 1939, had all been under German occupation for between two and half to three years, and were finally annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944. The speedy exodus of Poles from these regions was meant to erase their Polish past and to confirm the fact that the regions were indeed part of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"YL227\"/>}}\n\nThe document regarding the resettlement of Poles from the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs to Poland was signed 9 September 1944 in [[Lublin]] by Khrushchev and the head of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]] (the corresponding document with the Lithuanian SSR was signed on 22 September). The document specified who was eligible for the resettlement (it primarily applied to all Poles and Jews who were citizens of the [[Second Polish Republic]] before 17 September 1939, and their families), what property they could take with them, and what aid they would receive from the corresponding governments. The resettlement was divided into two phases: first, the eligible citizens were registered as wishing to be resettled; second, their request was to be reviewed and approved by the corresponding governments. About 750,000 Poles and Jews from the western regions of Ukraine were deported, as well as about 200,000 each from western Belarus and from Lithuanian SSR each. The deportations continued until August 1, 1946.\n\n=== Postwar transfers from Ukraine ===\n{{main|Population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine}}\nToward the end of [[World War II]], tensions between the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish AK]] and Ukrainians escalated into the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], led by the nationalist Ukrainian groups including the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]. Although the Soviet government was trying to eradicate these organizations, it did little to support the Polish minority; and instead encouraged population transfer. The haste at which repatriation was done was such that the Polish leader [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] was forced to intercede and approach Stalin to slow down the deportation, as the post-war Polish government was overwhelmed by the sudden great number of refugees needing aid.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n{{quote|The Soviet \"population exchanges\" of 1944-1946 ostensibly concerned [in the legal sense, nominal] citizens of prewar Poland, but in fact Poles and Jews were sent west, whereas Ukrainians had to stay in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. The real criterion was one of ethnicity, not citizenship. The [exclusively] ethnic criterion was applied to everyone in Volhynia, Ukrainians forced to stay despite their prewar Polish citizenship, Poles and Jews forced to leave despite their ancient traditions in the region. Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]] and Polish [[Massacres in Volhynia|survivors of the ethnic cleansing]] were generally willing to depart.

In response, Khrushchev introduced a different approach to dealing with this ''Polish problem''. Until this time, Polish children could be educated in Polish, according to the curriculum of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]]. Overnight this allowance was discontinued, and all Polish schools were required to teach the Soviet Ukrainian curriculum, with classes to be held only in Ukrainian and Russian. All males were told to prepare for mobilization into labor brigades within the [[Red Army]]. These actions were introduced specifically to encourage Polish emigration from Ukraine to Poland.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn January 1945, the [[NKVD]] arrested 772 Poles in Lviv (where, according to Soviet sources, on October 1, 1944, Poles represented 66.75% of population),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hryciuk |first1=Grzegorz |title=Sprawa Lwowa w\u0142a\u015bciwie wci\u0105\u017c otwarta\".

The Polish community was outraged about the arrests. The [[Polish underground press]] in Lviv characterized these acts as attempts to hasten the deportation of Poles from their city. Those arrested were released after they signed papers agreeing to emigrate to Poland. It is difficult to establish the exact number of Poles expelled from Lviv, but it was estimated as between 100,000 and 140,000.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Transfers from Belarus ===\nIn contrast to actions in the Ukrainian SSR, the communist officials in Belorussian SSR did not actively support deportation of Poles. Belorussian officials made it difficult for Polish activists to communicate with ''[[tutejszy|tuteishians]]'' \u2013 people who were undecided as to whether they considered themselves Polish or Belarusian.<ref name=ptas141>Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, ''Redrawing Nations: Ethnic Cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944\u20131948'', Rowman & Littlefield, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7425-1094-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGmTs2SceAgC&pg=PA141&dq=Lithuanization&as_brr=3&ei=wKzDSdSJNZTOkwTn5qWDDg Google Print, p.141]</ref> Much of the rural population, who usually had no official documents of identity, were denied the \"right\" of repatriation on the basis that they did not have documents stating they were Polish citizens.<ref name=ptas141/> In what was described as the \"fight for the people\", Polish officials attempted to get as many people repatriated as possible, while the Belorussian officials tried to retain them, particularly the peasants, while deporting most of the Polish [[intelligentsia]]. It is estimated that about 150,000 to 250,000 people were deported from Belarus. Similar numbers were registered as Poles but forced by the Belorussian officials to remain in Belarus. A similar number were denied registration as Poles in the Belorussian SSR.\n\nIn response, Poland followed a similar process in regards to the Belarusian population of the territory of the [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1919\u201339)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]], which was partially retained by Poland after World War II. It sought to retain some of the Belarusian people.<ref name=ptas141/>\n\nPart of the difference in treatment between the two areas arose from religious identity. In Ukraine, most Ukrainian Catholics were members of the powerful Ukrainian Uniate church, which was often in conflict with the Polish Roman Catholics. But in Belarus, most Belarusian Catholics were members of the Latin rite and were not in religious conflict with Poles. Some educated Belarusian Catholics who could speak Polish identified as \"Poles\", and they were deported from Stalin's regime to Poland, where religious freedom was somewhat more open. But Belarusian authorities did not want a mass exodus of their population to Poland and tried to retain practicing Catholics. Latin Rite Catholicism has retained a significant presence in Belarus, where about 10% of the people identify as Catholic in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== From Lithuania ===\nThe expulsion{{Dubious|date=September 2019}} of ethnic Poles from Lithuania saw numerous delays. Local Polish clergy were active in agitating against leaving, and the underground press called those who had registered for repatriation ''traitors''. Many ethnic Poles hoped that postwar Peace Conference would assign [[Vilnius region]] to Poland. After these hopes vanished, the number of people wanting to leave gradually increased, and they signed papers for the [[People's Republic of Poland]] [[State Repatriation Office]] representatives.\n\nOfficial attitudes in the Lithuanian SSR were similar to those of the Belarusian officials{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

Similarly the Soviet Union had enforced policy between 1939 and 1941, that targeted and expelled ethnic Poles residing in the Soviet zone of occupation following the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]]. The second wave of expulsions resulted from the retaking of Poland by the [[Red Army]] during the Soviet counter-offensive. It took over [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|territory for its republic of Ukraine]], a shift that was ratified at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union's then Allies of the West.\n\nThe postwar population transfers, targeting Polish nationals, were part of an official Soviet policy that affected more than one million Polish citizens, who were removed in stages from the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. After the war, following Soviet demands laid out during the [[Tehran Conference]] of 1943, the [[Kresy]] macroregion was formally incorporated into the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian [[Republics of the Soviet Union]].

Social and ethnic conflicts arose regarding the differences in religious practices between the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] adherents during the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595-96, when the Metropolitan of Kiev-Halych broke relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and accepted the authority of the Roman Catholic Pope and Vatican.<ref name=\"Dvornik1962\">{{cite book |last=Dvornik |first=Francis |year=1962 |title=The Slavs in European history and civilization |url=https://archive.org/details/slavsineuropeanh0000dvor_f9h0 |url-access=registration |edition=3 |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813507996 |page=[https://archive.org/details/slavsineuropeanh0000dvor_f9h0/page/347 347]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[partitions of Poland]], toward the end of the 18th century, resulted in the expulsions of ethnic Poles from their homes in the east for the first time in the history of the nation.

In 1922 Bolshevik Russian [[Red Army]], with their Bolshevik allies in Ukraine overwhelmed the government of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], including the annexed Ukrainian territories into the [[Soviet Union]].

In 1935 alone 1,500 families were deported to Siberia from the Soviet Ukraine. In 1936, 5,000 Polish families were deported to [[Kazakhstan]]. The deportations were accompanied by the gradual elimination of Polish cultural institutions. Polish-language newspapers were closed, as were Polish-language classes throughout Ukraine.\n\nSoon after the wave of deportations, the Soviet NKVD orchestrated the [[Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union]].

The document specified who was eligible for the resettlement (it primarily applied to all Poles and Jews who were citizens of the [[Second Polish Republic]] before 17 September 1939, and their families), what property they could take with them, and what aid they would receive from the corresponding governments. The resettlement was divided into two phases: first, the eligible citizens were registered as wishing to be resettled; second, their request was to be reviewed and approved by the corresponding governments. About 750,000 Poles and Jews from the western regions of Ukraine were deported, as well as about 200,000 each from western Belarus and from Lithuanian SSR each.

Although the Soviet government was trying to eradicate these organizations, it did little to support the Polish minority; and instead encouraged population transfer. The haste at which repatriation was done was such that the Polish leader [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] was forced to intercede and approach Stalin to slow down the deportation, as the post-war Polish government was overwhelmed by the sudden great number of refugees needing aid.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n{{quote|The Soviet \"population exchanges\" of 1944-1946 ostensibly concerned [in the legal sense, nominal] citizens of prewar Poland, but in fact Poles and Jews were sent west, whereas Ukrainians had to stay in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. The real criterion was one of ethnicity, not citizenship. The [exclusively] ethnic criterion was applied to everyone in Volhynia, Ukrainians forced to stay despite their prewar Polish citizenship, Poles and Jews forced to leave despite their ancient traditions in the region. Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]] and Polish [[Massacres in Volhynia|survivors of the ethnic cleansing]] were generally willing to depart. The history of Volhynia, as an ancient multi-confessional society, had come to an end.|[[Timothy Snyder]] <ref name=\"TS\">{{cite book |title=The Shoah in Ukraine: History, Testimony, Memorialization |editors=Ray Brandon, [[Wendy Lower]]|author=[[Timothy D.

In response, Khrushchev introduced a different approach to dealing with this ''Polish problem''. Until this time, Polish children could be educated in Polish, according to the curriculum of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]]. Overnight this allowance was discontinued, and all Polish schools were required to teach the Soviet Ukrainian curriculum, with classes to be held only in Ukrainian and Russian. All males were told to prepare for mobilization into labor brigades within the [[Red Army]]. These actions were introduced specifically to encourage Polish emigration from Ukraine to Poland.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn January 1945, the [[NKVD]] arrested 772 Poles in Lviv (where, according to Soviet sources, on October 1, 1944, Poles represented 66.75% of population),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hryciuk |first1=Grzegorz |title=Sprawa Lwowa w\u0142a\u015bciwie wci\u0105\u017c otwarta\".

The Polish community was outraged about the arrests. The [[Polish underground press]] in Lviv characterized these acts as attempts to hasten the deportation of Poles from their city. Those arrested were released after they signed papers agreeing to emigrate to Poland. It is difficult to establish the exact number of Poles expelled from Lviv, but it was estimated as between 100,000 and 140,000.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Transfers from Belarus ===\nIn contrast to actions in the Ukrainian SSR, the communist officials in Belorussian SSR did not actively support deportation of Poles. Belorussian officials made it difficult for Polish activists to communicate with ''[[tutejszy|tuteishians]]'' \u2013 people who were undecided as to whether they considered themselves Polish or Belarusian.<ref name=ptas141>Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, ''Redrawing Nations: Ethnic Cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944\u20131948'', Rowman & Littlefield, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7425-1094-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGmTs2SceAgC&pg=PA141&dq=Lithuanization&as_brr=3&ei=wKzDSdSJNZTOkwTn5qWDDg Google Print, p.141]</ref> Much of the rural population, who usually had no official documents of identity, were denied the \"right\" of repatriation on the basis that they did not have documents stating they were Polish citizens.<ref name=ptas141/> In what was described as the \"fight for the people\", Polish officials attempted to get as many people repatriated as possible, while the Belorussian officials tried to retain them, particularly the peasants, while deporting most of the Polish [[intelligentsia]]. It is estimated that about 150,000 to 250,000 people were deported from Belarus. Similar numbers were registered as Poles but forced by the Belorussian officials to remain in Belarus. A similar number were denied registration as Poles in the Belorussian SSR.\n\nIn response, Poland followed a similar process in regards to the Belarusian population of the territory of the [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1919\u201339)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]], which was partially retained by Poland after World War II. It sought to retain some of the Belarusian people.<ref name=ptas141/>\n\nPart of the difference in treatment between the two areas arose from religious identity. In Ukraine, most Ukrainian Catholics were members of the powerful Ukrainian Uniate church, which was often in conflict with the Polish Roman Catholics. But in Belarus, most Belarusian Catholics were members of the Latin rite and were not in religious conflict with Poles. Some educated Belarusian Catholics who could speak Polish identified as \"Poles\", and they were deported from Stalin's regime to Poland, where religious freedom was somewhat more open. But Belarusian authorities did not want a mass exodus of their population to Poland and tried to retain practicing Catholics. Latin Rite Catholicism has retained a significant presence in Belarus, where about 10% of the people identify as Catholic in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== From Lithuania ===\nThe expulsion{{Dubious|date=September 2019}} of ethnic Poles from Lithuania saw numerous delays. Local Polish clergy were active in agitating against leaving, and the underground press called those who had registered for repatriation ''traitors''. Many ethnic Poles hoped that postwar Peace Conference would assign [[Vilnius region]] to Poland. After these hopes vanished, the number of people wanting to leave gradually increased, and they signed papers for the [[People's Republic of Poland]] [[State Repatriation Office]] representatives.\n\nOfficial attitudes in the Lithuanian SSR were similar to those of the Belarusian officials{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}. The Lithuanian communist party was dominated by a nationalist faction {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which supported the removal of the Polish intelligentsia, particularly from the highly disputed [[Vilnius region]].<ref name=snyder91-93>[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569\u20131999'', Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-300-10586-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA92&vq=Lithuanization&dq=Lithuanization&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0 Google Print, p.91-93]</ref> The city of [[Vilnius]] was considered a historical capital of Lithuania; however, in the early 20th century{{Year needed|date=September 2019}} its population was around 40% Polish, 30% Jewish and 20% Russian and Belarusian, with only about 2\u20133% self-declared Lithuanians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The government considered the rural Polish population important to the agricultural economy, and believed those people would be relatively amenable to assimilation policies ([[Lithuanization]]).<ref name=ptas141/><ref name=snyder91-93/>\n\nBut the government encouraged expulsion of Poles from Vilnius, and facilitated it. The result was a rapid [[Polonization|depolonization]] and Lithuanization of the city<ref name=snyder91-93/> (80% of the Polish population was removed).<ref>Michael McQueen. \"Collaboration as an Element in the Polish-Lithuanian struggle over Vilnius.\" Joachim Tauber.

Soviet authorities persecuted individuals connected to the Polish resistance ([[Armia Krajowa]] and [[Polish Underground State]]). In the end, about 50% of the 400,000 people registered for relocation were allowed to leave.
