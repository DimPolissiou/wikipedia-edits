In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]], since September 1821, and later of the fortress of [[Patras]], since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Turkish troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''kapos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805\u20131806, Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]], since September 1821, and later of the fortress of [[Patras]], since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

{"title_page": "Vizing's theorem", "text_new": "In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's theorem''' states that every simple [[undirected graph]] may be [[edge coloring|edge colored]] using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|\u0394}} of the graph.\nAt least {{math|\u0394}} colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394}} colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors are necessary.\nA more generalized version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected [[multigraph]] without loops can be colored with at most {{math|\u0394+\u00b5}} colors, where {{math|\u00b5}} is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#multiplicity|multiplicity]] of the multigraph.\nThe theorem is named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors.

Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret.

The introduction of the F-Series marked the divergence of Ford car and truck design, developing a chassis intended specifically for truck use.\n\nAcross North America, Ford assembled F-Series trucks at sixteen different facilities during its production.  In Canada, Lincoln-Mercury sold the F-Series under the [[Mercury M series|Mercury M-Series]] nameplate to expand coverage in rural areas.  The first generation of the F-Series is the sole generation produced entirely with \"Flathead\" engines (inline-6 and V8) and without an automatic transmission option.  \n\n==Design==\nThe first-generation F-Series truck (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in late 1947 (going on sale January 16, 1948), replacing Ford trucks introduced in 1941.  It had a flat, one-piece windshield and integrated [[headlamp]]s.<ref name=\"Gunnell\">{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John A.|title=Standard Catalog of American Light-Duty Trucks|year=1993|publisher=krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-238-9}}</ref> It had a wider cab.<ref name=\"Gunnell\"/> Options included the \"See-Clear\" windshield washer (operated by foot plunger), passenger-side windshield wiper & sun visor, and Passenger-side taillight. The F-1 truck was also available with additional stainless steel trim and two horns as an option. All F-series were available with optional \"[[Marmon-Herrington]] All Wheel Drive\" until 1959.\n\nDesign of the F-Series truck changed tremendously from 1950 to 1954. From 1948 to 1950, the grill was a series of horizontal bars and the headlights were set into the fenders.  For 1951 and 1952, the headlights were connected by a wide aerodynamic cross piece with three similarly aerodynamic supports. The rear window was wider in these later trucks and the dashboard was redesigned. This new cab was called the \"Five-Star Cab\".\n\n==Models==\nThe first-generation F-Series was marketed in eight different chassis (based on their GVWR), giving them their model names; the F-1 was the lightest-capacity version with the F-8 as the highest.  F-1 through F-3 pickup trucks were offered (forming the basis for [[Panel truck|panel trucks]]) and the bare F-3 chassis served as the basis for a [[Multi-stop truck|parcel delivery truck]].  The heavier-duty F-4 chassis was produced as a light-duty commercial truck.  The F-5 and F-6 were produced as medium-duty trucks in three configurations, a conventional, a COE/cab-over (as the [[Ford C series|C-Series]]), and a school bus chassis (as the [[Ford B series|B-Series]], no bodywork rear of the firewall).  The F-7 and F-8 were heavy-duty commercial trucks, marketed under the \"Big Job\" brand name from 1951.      \n\nWith the exception of bus chassis and parcel-delivery vehicles (which used bodywork produced by second-party manufacturers), Ford shared the same cab design on all F-Series trucks; C-Series trucks moved the cab upward and forward, requiring a higher hood.       \n\nThe most common first-generation model was the F-1 with a 6&thinsp;\u00bd-foot bed, followed by the F-2 and F-3 Express models with an {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}} bed.   \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"4\" |1948-1952 Ford F-Series (Bonus-Built) model range\n|-\n!Model\n!Description\n!GVWR\n!Body Style(s)\n|-\n|F-1\n|<big>\u00bd</big> ton\n|{{Convert|4700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pickup truck \nPanel truck\n|-\n|F-2\n|<big>\u00be</big> ton\n|{{Convert|5700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|F-3\n|<big>\u00be</big> ton (heavy duty)\n|{{Convert|6800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n{{Convert|7000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (parcel delivery)\n\n{{Convert|7800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (optional rear springs)\n|Pickup truck \nPanel truck\n\nParcel delivery truck\n|-\n|F-4\n|1 ton\n1\u00bc ton (optional)\n|{{Convert|7500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n{{Convert|10000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|Conventional (light-duty)\n|-\n|F-5\n|1\u00bd ton\n|{{Convert|10000 - 14500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |COE (C-Series)\nBus chassis (B-Series)\n\nConventional (medium-duty)\n|-\n|F-6\n|2 ton\n|{{Convert|14000 - 16000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|F-7\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"Big Job\"\n|{{Convert|17000 - 19000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Conventional (heavy-duty)\n|-\n|F-8\n|{{Convert|20000 - 22000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Camion Ford Cr\u00eaperie Bretonne.jpg|F-1 pickup\nFile:FordPanelVan-rear.jpg|F-1 panel van\nFile:Livingston, New Jersey (5212288794).jpg|F-2 (converted to flatbed)\nFile:Ford F4 (1949), Dutch licence registration BE-15-29 pic2.JPG|F-4 truck\nFile:1949 Ford F-6 2 ton COE Truck (30049959164).jpg|C-6 COE flatbed\nFile:Egged 038.jpg| B-6 (bus chassis) \nFile:1950 Ford F6 stake truck (1143432353).jpg|F-6 stake truck\nFile:Rico Fire Department.JPG|F-7 Big Job fire truck\n</gallery>         \n\nVariation by Year:   [[File:1951 Ford F1 or F2 in Greenwich.jpg|thumb|1951 Ford F-series, showing the larger rear window]]\n[[File:1949 Ford F-3 3.9 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|1949 Ford F-3, showing the smaller rear window]]\n\n*'''1948''': Feature a wider, longer, and taller cabs.

The truck underwent several revisions, with the cab receiving a larger rear window and updated door panels; for pickup trucks, the tailgate was redesigned, along with the introduction of a hardwood floor.   \n*'''1952''': The [[builder's plate]] was attached to the inside of the glove box door.

But I just thought, no, I'm pretty sure the human brain is capable of so much more than what I'm being told I'm capable of. When people say you need help it's like, do I? With what? And if you could just tell me what I need help with, couldn't I just go and work on it myself?\" His search for self led him to spiritual authors such as [[Eckhart Tolle]], and to experimenting with magic mushrooms: \"You take mushrooms and then you go, I have no problems,\" he explains. \"I am an ant walking around this planet in a speck in the middle of nowhere. And that's the truth, it's all we are.\"<ref>http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/matt-corby-feature/3704-page-1</ref>\n\nCorby's musical influences include artists such as [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]], [[Scott Mathews]], [[Nick Drake]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Charles Bradley (singer)|Charles Bradley]] and [[Sam Cooke]]. Corby is good friends with Australian musician [[Jarryd James]], whom Corby credits with having helped with his musical development.\n\nCorby has an older sister Grace, whose name is tattooed on his left side.\n\nCorby is not religious, having said: \"I'm a stoner and I don't really have much sympathy for religion any more [...] I basically believe that human beings are pure entities when they're born, and they have the ability to do whatever they want in order to change the Earth in a positive way. And it's just... they get lied to, and in the process of becoming an adult that ends up fucking up the world.\"<ref>http://www.clashmusic.com/features/amen-brother-the-testament-of-matt-corby</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, Corby became a father with his first child Hugh.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/first-spin:-matt-corbys-new-song-is-inspired-by-willy-wonka-an/10066752</ref> Speaking to [[Beat Magazine]] regarding the way fatherhood has changed Matt's perspective, he states \"Most of my life, music has been the number one focus. And now it sort of doesn\u2019t fit in that category anymore \u2013 it\u2019s really important, but, it\u2019s not as important as my child...When I come back to music, I\u2019m then a lot happier and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m constantly exposing myself to only music, and then getting really annoyed about it, or getting hard on myself.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/matt-corby-moving-country-starting-family-his-simplified-new-album|title=Matt Corby on moving to the country, starting a family and his simplified new album|website=Beat Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n==Tour==\n*[[Telluric Tour]] (2016)\n*Rainbow Valley Tour (2019)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scenestr.com.au/music/matt-corby-releases-video-for-new-single-no-ordinary-life-20180927|title=Matt Corby Releases Video For New Single 'No Ordinary Life'|last=Writers|first=Staff|work=scenestr - Pop Culture & Entertainment|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThe current live touring band consists of:\n* Matt Corby \u2013 vocals, guitar, flute\n* Michael Haydon \u2013 drums\n* Tristan \"T-Bone\" Thorne \u2013 bass guitar\n* Bree Tranter \u2013 keyboard, backing vocals, flute, tambourine, egg shaker ([[ganz\u00e1]])\n* Joel Dowling \u2013 guitar\n* Jack Standen \u2013 keyboard, backing vocals\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:11em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"|[[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|[[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br><ref name=\"Australian charts\"/>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|[[MegaCharts|NL]]<br /><ref name=\"Dutch charts\">[http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Matt+Corby&titel=Brother&cat=s \"Discografie Matt Corby\"].

The album was the highest local debut of the week in Australia, charting at #4 on the [[ARIA]] Album Charts beaten only by the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|''A Star Is Born'']] soundtrack at #1 and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''Bohemian Rhapsody'' and ''Greatest Hits'' at #2 and #3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/article/FBYMBgkICwo/matt-corby-makes-highest-local-debut-as-king-gizzard-flood-the-aria-album-charts|title=/|website=The Music|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> He also subsequently released the second, third and fourth singles from the album, titled \"All Fired Up\", \"All That I See\", and \"Miracle Love\".\n\nIn February 2019, Matt released a mini-documentary '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8T7hI3c-lo Behind Rainbow Valley]' documenting the recording and creative process of the Rainbow Valley album. Speaking of the influence of his newborn son Hugh on the creation of the album, Corby states \"I wanted to create something that was almost instructional for my little boy... A reference for him of the way I see reality and the simple truths that I\u2019ve come across. The lyrics are simple truths. I\u2019m not trying to be too clever or poetic. If anything it was, \u2018This is the way I see the world and this is the way I feel about it\u2019.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusicnetwork.com/matt-corby-drops-doco-behind-making-of-rainbow-valley/|title=Matt Corby drops doco behind making of Rainbow Valley|date=2019-02-10|website=The Music Network|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\nMatt will also be embarking on the 2019 ''Rainbow Valley Tour'' in Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, starting in Glasgow on 24 January.\n\nMatt was announced as joining the star studded lineup at WOMAD, in Adelaide on 9 March 2020.\n\n==Personal life==\nCorby stated that he enjoys surfing and reading.\n\nBy the time he was 20 he was reading books on philosophy and neuroscience, the latter because he wanted to know how the brain functions, partly because of his experiences with depression and anxiety. \"People have said I have depression before, especially when I was younger,\" he offers. \"People were like, you should really go see someone. But I just thought, no, I'm pretty sure the human brain is capable of so much more than what I'm being told I'm capable of. When people say you need help it's like, do I? With what? And if you could just tell me what I need help with, couldn't I just go and work on it myself?\" His search for self led him to spiritual authors such as [[Eckhart Tolle]], and to experimenting with magic mushrooms: \"You take mushrooms and then you go, I have no problems,\" he explains. \"I am an ant walking around this planet in a speck in the middle of nowhere. And that's the truth, it's all we are.\"<ref>http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/matt-corby-feature/3704-page-1</ref>\n\nCorby's musical influences include artists such as [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]], [[Scott Mathews]], [[Nick Drake]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Charles Bradley (singer)|Charles Bradley]] and [[Sam Cooke]]. Corby is good friends with Australian musician [[Jarryd James]], whom Corby credits with having helped with his musical development.\n\nCorby has an older sister Grace, whose name is tattooed on his left side.\n\nCorby is not religious, having said: \"I'm a stoner and I don't really have much sympathy for religion any more [...] I basically believe that human beings are pure entities when they're born, and they have the ability to do whatever they want in order to change the Earth in a positive way. And it's just... they get lied to, and in the process of becoming an adult that ends up fucking up the world.\"<ref>http://www.clashmusic.com/features/amen-brother-the-testament-of-matt-corby</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, Corby became a father with his first child Hugh.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/first-spin:-matt-corbys-new-song-is-inspired-by-willy-wonka-an/10066752</ref> Speaking to [[Beat Magazine]] regarding the way fatherhood has changed Matt's perspective, he states \"Most of my life, music has been the number one focus.
