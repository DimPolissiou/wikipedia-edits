While the clinical presentation of the virus can be severe, it has also been found in mild cases of respiratory infection.  The [[comorbidity]] of HCoV-NL63 with other respiratory infections, has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint.  A study of clinical symptoms in HCoV-NL63 patients without secondary infection, reported the most common symptoms to be fever, cough, [[rhinitis]], sore throat, hoarseness, [[bronchitis]], [[bronchiolitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[croup]].\nAn early study investigating children with lower respiratory tract illness, found that HCoV-NL63 was more commonly found in outpatients than hospitalized patients, suggesting that it is a common cold virus similar to [[Human coronavirus 229E|HCoV-229E]] and [[Human coronavirus OC43|HCoV-OC43]], which generally cause less severe symptoms.<ref name=\"van_der_Hoek_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Hoek L, Berkhout B | title = Questions concerning the New Haven coronavirus | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 192 | issue = 2 | pages = 350\u20131; author reply 353\u20134 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15962232 | doi = 10.1086/430795 }}</ref> However, the high frequency of [[croup]] is specific to HCoV-NL63 infection.\n\n==Cause==\nIt is believed that the route of HCoV-NL63 spread is through direct person-to-person transmission in highly populated areas.

These population include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and [[immunocompromised]] individuals.  The virus seems to have seasonal incidence, occurring most frequently in the winter months in [[temperate climate]]s.  In more extreme and [[tropical climate]]s the virus has no preference toward a particular season.  Many studies have reported the co-occurrence of HCoV-NL63 with other [[human coronavirus]], ''[[Influenza A virus]]'', ''[[Human orthopneumovirus]]'' (RSV), [[parainfluenza virus]], and ''[[Human metapneumovirus]]'' (hMPV).<ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" />\n\n==Mechanism==\nTransmission of HCoV-NL63 is likely through droplet expulsion from the [[respiratory tract]], which may be airborne or spread through close personal contact. The virus is able to survive for up to seven days in respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature <ref name=\"Hofmann_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmann H, Pyrc K, van der Hoek L, Geier M, Berkhout B, P\u00f6hlmann S | title = Human coronavirus NL63 employs the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor for cellular entry | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 22 | pages = 7988\u201393 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15897467 | pmc = 1142358 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409465102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.7988H }}</ref> Once the virus has entered the host it binds to [[cellular receptors]] using spike proteins, similar to those found in [[HIV-1]].  The virus is able to use Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ([[ACE2]]) as an entry receptor to bind to and enter target cells.<ref name=\"Hofmann_2005\"/> No determination of the specific entry of the virus into the host cell has been completed.  Therefore, entrance into the cell is either through direct [[cell fusion]] with the [[plasma membrane]] or [[endocytosis]] followed by fusion with the membrane.  Due to the lack of a [[cDNA]] clone of HCoV-NL63, research on the replication cycle is limited.  Because it is a positive single-stranded [[RNA virus]], the processes of replication via [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]] can be carried out in the [[cytoplasm]] of the infected cell.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIt is difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by infection of the HCoV-NL63 virus and those caused by other common human viruses, making diagnosis and detection complex.  [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] of samples collected through [[nasopharyngeal swab]] is the most commonly used method for detection of the virus. <ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" /> [[Viral culture]] or [[blood serum]] testing for [[antibodies]] may also be used for the confirmation of infection.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoV-NL63 including:  washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and not touching the eyes, mouth, or nose.<ref>{{cite web | work = Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/ | title = About Coronavirus | access-date = July 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prognosis==\nTreatment for the HCoV-NL63 virus is dependent on the severity of associated symptomology.

This was the family name of one of the land owners in the community, whose name was also given to the community schoolhouse.<ref>{{Citation| last =Rouse| first =J. K. | title = A History of Cabarrus County, North Carolina  | date =1962-06-14}}</ref>  The land on which the schoolhouse was located is now occupied by [[Gilwood Presbyterian Church]].\n\nOther colloquial names for the community which originated near the turn of the 20th century included '''Gandersburg''' and '''Pinchgut'''.<ref name=\"Smith, et al\">{{Citation| last =Smith| first =Gertrude High | title = Personal Recollections of my Grandmother, on Her Death  | date =1920-04-01|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Gandersburg stemmed from a community sport where a live goose was tied head-down in a large tree behind the '' Will Johnson General Store'' and horseback riders would attempt to snatch the head from the goose while going at full gallop. Pinchgut referred to the hard times the community went through during [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].<ref>{{Citation| last =Seaford| first =Danny | title = A History of Gilwood Church and Community  | date =1999-11-01|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Roads===\n\nThe main road through the community was originally known as ''Statesville Road'', which occupied portions of the current [[North Carolina Highway 3]], Odell School Road, Bradford Road, Macedonia Church Road and [[North Carolina Highway 73]] on its route between [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]] and Concord.\n\nIn 1929, the [[North Carolina|state]] built a paved, two-lane road through the area. The road was originally signed as North Carolina Highway 74. In 1935, [[U.S. Route 74]] was built through North Carolina, and the state highway was re-signed as [[North Carolina Highway 73]], more commonly as '' Davidson-Concord Highway''. With the completion of this highway, the antiquated bridge on the Statesville Road over [[Coddle Creek]] was demolished, and the lower end of Statesville Road was re-routed to link to ''Poplar Tent Road'' and ''Derita Road'', crossing Highway 73 and forming what is now considered the center of the Odell School community. This road is currently known as Odell School Road.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the mill village of [[Kannapolis]] was founded in northern Cabarrus County, and a road was extended from Baker's Creek in that village to join with the Statesville Road just west of [[Coddle Creek]]. This road was known for many years as Mooresville Road, then Mooresville-Kannapolis Highway.  It now forms a major part of [[Dale Earnhardt]] Boulevard, or [[North Carolina Highway 3]].\n\n==Churches==\n\n===Gilwood Presbyterian Church===\n\nThe founding of this church occurred in November 1889 on the ''Deweese Schoolhouse'' property donated to the church by ''Isaiah Deweese''. The first sanctuary was erected in the 1890s, and a fellowship building, ''\"The Hut\"'' was built in the 1920s. The sanctuary was expanded by adding [[Sunday School]] rooms and was brick veneered in the 1930s.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, plans were being made for reconstruction of the church facilities. An educational wing was built in 1963. This was followed by a new sanctuary, connected to the educational wing, in 1969. The former sanctuary was demolished soon after. A greatly expanded fellowship hall and ministry center was built, replacing \"The Hut\" in the 1990s. The latest project, remodeling and expansion of the church sanctuary, was finished in 2004.\n\nFounded as a congregation in the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]], or Southern Presbyterian denomination, a 1980s merger brought it into the fold of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n===Shiloh United Methodist Church===\n\nThis church was founded in the late 19th century as a congregation of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].  Through the process of mergers, the congregation is now a part of the [[United Methodist Church]].\n\nThe original sanctuary was constructed on ''Odell School Road'' just south of ''Shiloh Church Road'', and was a frame structure, outfitted with an open steeple and three bells.  Despite the name, this church was never located on ''Shiloh Church road, but rather to the south of it.\n\nIn the 1930s, the sanctuary was remodeled and the steeple enclosed to a more traditional design.  An educational wing and fellowship hall were constructed in the 1960s, and the sanctuary was replaced with a brick structure in the 1990s.\n\nThe original sanctuary building still exists, having been moved to a site on '' Shiloh Church Road'' and converted to a private residence.\n\n===Odell Baptist Church===\n\nFounded as a daughter church of Concord First Baptist Church, the '' Pastorium'' (parsonage) and the original sanctuary of the church was constructed in the early 1960s.  Other buildings for the church were constructed later in the 20th century, with the original building being converted to an educational center and the Pastorium being converted to church offices.\n\nThis church is located east of the [[Coddle Creek]] Reservoir on [[North Carolina Highway 73]].  Odell Baptist Church is a constituent church of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].\n\n===Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church===\n\nThis church congregation was begun following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when African-American members of ''Poplar Tent Presbyterian Church'' decided to form their own congregation.  Their original sanctuary was a frame structure built off of ''Odell School Road''.\n\nThis building served the congregation for nearly a century, being replaced with a brick structure in the late 1960s.  For most of its history, Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church has shared a pastor with nearby '' Bethpage Presbyterian Church, Concord''.\n\nFounded as a congregation of the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.]], denominational merger has brought them into the fold of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n==Schools==\n\n===Deweese/Gilwood School===\n\nThe founding of Gilwood Presbyterian Church in 1889 led to the re-naming of the community school building to ''Gilwood School'' and its relocation to a building behind the former ''Will Johnson General Store'' at the corner of Statesville Road and ''Mason Goodman Road'' (now called Windy Road).<ref name=\"Smith, et al\"/>\n\n===Odell High School===\n\nIn 1929, W. R. Odell School was built on the corner tract of land formed by the newly routed highways. The school was named for the founder of Odell Mill, the first textile mill in Cabarrus County. Odell School consolidated community schools at Gilwood, Bethpage, [[Poplar Tent]] and Macedonia, and initially offered eleven grades of instruction in one location. The school was expanded to twelve grades in the 1940s, and remained the community's only school and namesake until further school consolidations began in the late 20th century.\n\n===County consolidation and new facilities===\n\nGrades 9 through 12 were moved to [[Northwest Cabarrus High School]] in 1966, and grades 6 through 8 to [[Northwest Cabarrus Middle School]] in 1988.  A replacement school on ''Moss Farm Road'' (off Harris Road) was constructed, and [[Kindergarten]] and elementary grades began the 2007\u20132008 school year in the new facility.  The [[Cabarrus County Schools]] administration has established an advanced learning center in part of the original Odell School, but plans have been made to sell the facility and grounds, and it will probably be used for commercial development in the near future.  Beginning with the 2009\u20132010 school year, high school students in grades 9, 10 and 11 began attending the newly constructed [[Cox Mill High School]], located on the southern edge of the Odell School community.  12th grade continued to attend [[Northwest Cabarrus High School]] to graduate in 2010, and in the fall of 2010 Cox Mill expanded to a full four-grade high school. In 2016, Odell School was reconstructed and reopened as a 3-5 school by the name of W.R. Odell Elementary School. Previously, such students would attend the Odell Elementary (now named W.R. Odell Primary School) on Moss Farm Road.\n\n==Odell Volunteer Fire Department==\n\nOrganized in 1961, the department's \"trial by fire\" came on a winter night in 1963, when the gymnasium of the former Odell High School burned down. Though the gym was a total loss, the department was able to save the adjoining school buildings from destruction.\n\nThe Odell Volunteer Fire Department is housed in a modern facility on Highway 73, and has expanded to provide [[First Responder]] service for the area. Most of the firefighters are trained as [[Emergency Medical Technicians]]. The department serves as backup and assistance to the Concord (NC) Fire Department for emergency calls to [[Concord Regional Airport]].\n\nIn 2010, Odell Volunteer Fire Department built its first substation, a five-bay facility on Shiloh Church Road. The station was designed to function as a fully stand-alone fire department, in anticipation of future annexation in the area by Concord, Kannapolis and/or Davidson.\n\n==Nightingale Nursing Home==\n\nThis nursing facility was founded in the early 1960s by Mrs. Bertha Hartsell and Mrs. Florence Furr, neighbors and residents of the Odell School Community.  Initially an [[Intermediate Care Facility]], by the 1970s the facility had upgraded to [[Skilled Nursing Facility]] status.\n\nIn the late 70s, sale of the facility resulted in a name change to [[Brian Center]]-Odell, although the facility remained privately owned by one of the officers of the Brian Center Corporation.  A later split with the corporation resulted in a name change to '' Odell Nursing Center''.\n\nA major expansion in the 1980s doubled the number of beds in the facility, and was followed by a sale in 1990 to Kentucky-based [[Cardinal Health Care]].  In 1995, Cardinal built a new facility near [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] and transferred the nursing services out of the Odell School community.\n\nThe buildings currently function as a retirement/[[assisted living]] facility.\n\n==Community stores==\n\n===Johnson's General Store===\nJohnson's General Store was owned and operated by several generations of the Johnson family, beginning in the mid-19th century, and was located at the intersection of the current Odell School Road and Windy Road.  It was long recognized as a community gathering place, and as automobiles began to be owned by community residents, the store became a dealer of [[Standard Oil]], [[Esso]] and finally [[Exxon]] gasoline and petroleum products.\n\nThrough the early part of the 20th century, William Johnson owned the store.  His brother, Thomas Johnson assumed ownership in the late 1950s until the store closed in 1978,  The building still stands, and is currently used as a residence.\n\n===Odell Grocery history===\n\nCloser to the center of the Odell School community, the Hartsell Store was founded in 1920 near the corner of present-day Odell School Road and Lockwood Road.  When Highway 73 was routed through the community, the Hartsell family moved the store to the corner of the highway across from Odell School.  There, they transformed it into a full-service [[gasoline station]].\n\nIn the mid-1950s, The Hartsell family sold the service station to W. A. (Dub) Irvin, and as Irvin's Service Station it served motorists passing through the community for over 30 years.  Irvin retired and after renting the store for several years he sold it to Carl Overcash, another longtime Odell School community resident, and the name changed to Carl's General Store.  Following the death of owner Ronald Overcash in 2010, the store was sold and became known as Odell Grocery.  Over the years, the service station has sold [[Gulf Oil]], [[Union 76]] and [[Phillips 66]] gasoline and petroleum products and currently sells Marathon branded fuel.\n\n==Tulin telephone exchange==\n\nOdell Community once had its own telephone exchange, independent of the [[Bell System]].  The system was operated by the Johnson Family, who ran it from their boarding house on what is now Odell School Road.  The system was built in the years following World War I from surplus electrical equipment and telephone poles harvested from land in the community.  At its peak, some 50 families and 5 businesses were on the exchange, which took its \"company\" name from the nickname of Mrs. Johnson, who served as operator.\n\nThe \"Tulin\" exchange served to link widely separated farm families of the day, and connect them with medical, law enforcement and other vital services in the community.  One long-distance telephone line . . . to the county seat of Concord (NC) . . . was available to the exchange.  Individual telephone numbers were identified by the exchange name, followed by the number of \"long\" rings followed by the number of \"short\" rings.  For example, someone with the telephone number \"Tulin 24\" would know that they had a call when the telephone rang with two long rings and four short ones.<ref name=\"Smith, et al\"/>\n\nTelephone service on the \"Tulin\" exchange ended in 1942, when the lines were taken down and the telephones scrapped for salvage metals to aid the fighting of [[World War II]].  For the next decade, telephone service to the Odell School community was limited to two lines to Concord . . . one at Odell High School and the other at Johnson's General Store.  By 1952, The [[Windstream Communications|Concord Telephone Company]] began to connect the community to both Concord and Kannapolis with rotary-dial telephone service.\n\n==Current issues==\n\nAs of late there has been considerable push to incorporate the community. In a movement known as BLOCK (Better Land-use for Odell, [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus]], and [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]]), citizens have pushed for incorporation to halt the recent attempts by the city of Kannapolis to annex the area and use it as an enlargement for their tax base.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Cabarrus County seat of [[Concord, North Carolina]] is located some 11 miles east of Odell School. To the west lie the North Mecklenburg towns of Huntersville and [[Davidson, North Carolina|Davidson]], located on the eastern bank of [[Lake Norman]]. The community consists of a volunteer fire department, gas station, elementary school, and 1,100 residences.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cabarrus County, North Carolina}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Cabarrus County, North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Odell School, North Carolina\n|settlement_type          = [[List of unincorporated communities in North Carolina|Unincorporated community]]\n|nickname                 =\n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            =\n|imagesize                =\n|image_caption            =\n|image_flag               =\n|image_seal               =\n|pushpin_map              = North Carolina#USA\n|pushpin_label_position   = none\n|pushpin_map_caption      = Location of Odell School Community in North Carolina\n|pushpin_mapsize          =\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[North Carolina]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in North Carolina|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus]]\n\n<!-- Government -->\n|government_footnotes     =\n|government_type          =\n|leader_title             =\n|leader_name              =\n|leader_title1            =\n|leader_name1             =\n|established_title        =\n|established_date         =\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[United States Census, 2000|2000]]\n|population_footnotes     =\n|population_total         =\n|population_density_km2   =\n|population_density_sq_mi =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = <ref name=GNIS>{{Gnis|1024847|Odell School, North Carolina}}.

R. Odell Elementary School, a part of the [[Cabarrus County Schools]] system.  It lies between [[Huntersville, North Carolina|Huntersville]] and [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prior names===\n\nThe oldest name for this community on record was the name given to the township, '''Deweese''', in the mid-19th century.  This was the family name of one of the land owners in the community, whose name was also given to the community schoolhouse.<ref>{{Citation| last =Rouse| first =J. K. | title = A History of Cabarrus County, North Carolina  | date =1962-06-14}}</ref>  The land on which the schoolhouse was located is now occupied by [[Gilwood Presbyterian Church]].\n\nOther colloquial names for the community which originated near the turn of the 20th century included '''Gandersburg''' and '''Pinchgut'''.<ref name=\"Smith, et al\">{{Citation| last =Smith| first =Gertrude High | title = Personal Recollections of my Grandmother, on Her Death  | date =1920-04-01|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Gandersburg stemmed from a community sport where a live goose was tied head-down in a large tree behind the '' Will Johnson General Store'' and horseback riders would attempt to snatch the head from the goose while going at full gallop. Pinchgut referred to the hard times the community went through during [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].<ref>{{Citation| last =Seaford| first =Danny | title = A History of Gilwood Church and Community  | date =1999-11-01|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Roads===\n\nThe main road through the community was originally known as ''Statesville Road'', which occupied portions of the current [[North Carolina Highway 3]], Odell School Road, Bradford Road, Macedonia Church Road and [[North Carolina Highway 73]] on its route between [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]] and Concord.\n\nIn 1929, the [[North Carolina|state]] built a paved, two-lane road through the area. The road was originally signed as North Carolina Highway 74. In 1935, [[U.S. Route 74]] was built through North Carolina, and the state highway was re-signed as [[North Carolina Highway 73]], more commonly as '' Davidson-Concord Highway''. With the completion of this highway, the antiquated bridge on the Statesville Road over [[Coddle Creek]] was demolished, and the lower end of Statesville Road was re-routed to link to ''Poplar Tent Road'' and ''Derita Road'', crossing Highway 73 and forming what is now considered the center of the Odell School community. This road is currently known as Odell School Road.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the mill village of [[Kannapolis]] was founded in northern Cabarrus County, and a road was extended from Baker's Creek in that village to join with the Statesville Road just west of [[Coddle Creek]]. This road was known for many years as Mooresville Road, then Mooresville-Kannapolis Highway.  It now forms a major part of [[Dale Earnhardt]] Boulevard, or [[North Carolina Highway 3]].\n\n==Churches==\n\n===Gilwood Presbyterian Church===\n\nThe founding of this church occurred in November 1889 on the ''Deweese Schoolhouse'' property donated to the church by ''Isaiah Deweese''. The first sanctuary was erected in the 1890s, and a fellowship building, ''\"The Hut\"'' was built in the 1920s. The sanctuary was expanded by adding [[Sunday School]] rooms and was brick veneered in the 1930s.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, plans were being made for reconstruction of the church facilities. An educational wing was built in 1963. This was followed by a new sanctuary, connected to the educational wing, in 1969. The former sanctuary was demolished soon after. A greatly expanded fellowship hall and ministry center was built, replacing \"The Hut\" in the 1990s. The latest project, remodeling and expansion of the church sanctuary, was finished in 2004.\n\nFounded as a congregation in the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]], or Southern Presbyterian denomination, a 1980s merger brought it into the fold of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n===Shiloh United Methodist Church===\n\nThis church was founded in the late 19th century as a congregation of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].  Through the process of mergers, the congregation is now a part of the [[United Methodist Church]].\n\nThe original sanctuary was constructed on ''Odell School Road'' just south of ''Shiloh Church Road'', and was a frame structure, outfitted with an open steeple and three bells.  Despite the name, this church was never located on ''Shiloh Church road, but rather to the south of it.\n\nIn the 1930s, the sanctuary was remodeled and the steeple enclosed to a more traditional design.  An educational wing and fellowship hall were constructed in the 1960s, and the sanctuary was replaced with a brick structure in the 1990s.\n\nThe original sanctuary building still exists, having been moved to a site on '' Shiloh Church Road'' and converted to a private residence.\n\n===Odell Baptist Church===\n\nFounded as a daughter church of Concord First Baptist Church, the '' Pastorium'' (parsonage) and the original sanctuary of the church was constructed in the early 1960s.  Other buildings for the church were constructed later in the 20th century, with the original building being converted to an educational center and the Pastorium being converted to church offices.\n\nThis church is located east of the [[Coddle Creek]] Reservoir on [[North Carolina Highway 73]].  Odell Baptist Church is a constituent church of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].\n\n===Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church===\n\nThis church congregation was begun following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when African-American members of ''Poplar Tent Presbyterian Church'' decided to form their own congregation.  Their original sanctuary was a frame structure built off of ''Odell School Road''.\n\nThis building served the congregation for nearly a century, being replaced with a brick structure in the late 1960s.  For most of its history, Cedar Grove Presbyterian Church has shared a pastor with nearby '' Bethpage Presbyterian Church, Concord''.\n\nFounded as a congregation of the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.]], denominational merger has brought them into the fold of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n==Schools==\n\n===Deweese/Gilwood School===\n\nThe founding of Gilwood Presbyterian Church in 1889 led to the re-naming of the community school building to ''Gilwood School'' and its relocation to a building behind the former ''Will Johnson General Store'' at the corner of Statesville Road and ''Mason Goodman Road'' (now called Windy Road).<ref name=\"Smith, et al\"/>\n\n===Odell High School===\n\nIn 1929, W. R. Odell School was built on the corner tract of land formed by the newly routed highways. The school was named for the founder of Odell Mill, the first textile mill in Cabarrus County. Odell School consolidated community schools at Gilwood, Bethpage, [[Poplar Tent]] and Macedonia, and initially offered eleven grades of instruction in one location. The school was expanded to twelve grades in the 1940s, and remained the community's only school and namesake until further school consolidations began in the late 20th century.\n\n===County consolidation and new facilities===\n\nGrades 9 through 12 were moved to [[Northwest Cabarrus High School]] in 1966, and grades 6 through 8 to [[Northwest Cabarrus Middle School]] in 1988.  A replacement school on ''Moss Farm Road'' (off Harris Road) was constructed, and [[Kindergarten]] and elementary grades began the 2007\u20132008 school year in the new facility.  The [[Cabarrus County Schools]] administration has established an advanced learning center in part of the original Odell School, but plans have been made to sell the facility and grounds, and it will probably be used for commercial development in the near future.  Beginning with the 2009\u20132010 school year, high school students in grades 9, 10 and 11 began attending the newly constructed [[Cox Mill High School]], located on the southern edge of the Odell School community.  12th grade continued to attend [[Northwest Cabarrus High School]] to graduate in 2010, and in the fall of 2010 Cox Mill expanded to a full four-grade high school. In 2016, Odell School was reconstructed and reopened as a 3-5 school by the name of W.R. Odell Elementary School. Previously, such students would attend the Odell Elementary (now named W.R. Odell Primary School) on Moss Farm Road.\n\n==Odell Volunteer Fire Department==\n\nOrganized in 1961, the department's \"trial by fire\" came on a winter night in 1963, when the gymnasium of the former Odell High School burned down. Though the gym was a total loss, the department was able to save the adjoining school buildings from destruction.\n\nThe Odell Volunteer Fire Department is housed in a modern facility on Highway 73, and has expanded to provide [[First Responder]] service for the area. Most of the firefighters are trained as [[Emergency Medical Technicians]]. The department serves as backup and assistance to the Concord (NC) Fire Department for emergency calls to [[Concord Regional Airport]].\n\nIn 2010, Odell Volunteer Fire Department built its first substation, a five-bay facility on Shiloh Church Road. The station was designed to function as a fully stand-alone fire department, in anticipation of future annexation in the area by Concord, Kannapolis and/or Davidson.\n\n==Nightingale Nursing Home==\n\nThis nursing facility was founded in the early 1960s by Mrs. Bertha Hartsell and Mrs. Florence Furr, neighbors and residents of the Odell School Community.  Initially an [[Intermediate Care Facility]], by the 1970s the facility had upgraded to [[Skilled Nursing Facility]] status.\n\nIn the late 70s, sale of the facility resulted in a name change to [[Brian Center]]-Odell, although the facility remained privately owned by one of the officers of the Brian Center Corporation.  A later split with the corporation resulted in a name change to '' Odell Nursing Center''.\n\nA major expansion in the 1980s doubled the number of beds in the facility, and was followed by a sale in 1990 to Kentucky-based [[Cardinal Health Care]].  In 1995, Cardinal built a new facility near [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] and transferred the nursing services out of the Odell School community.\n\nThe buildings currently function as a retirement/[[assisted living]] facility.\n\n==Community stores==\n\n===Johnson's General Store===\nJohnson's General Store was owned and operated by several generations of the Johnson family, beginning in the mid-19th century, and was located at the intersection of the current Odell School Road and Windy Road.  It was long recognized as a community gathering place, and as automobiles began to be owned by community residents, the store became a dealer of [[Standard Oil]], [[Esso]] and finally [[Exxon]] gasoline and petroleum products.\n\nThrough the early part of the 20th century, William Johnson owned the store.

Over the years, the service station has sold [[Gulf Oil]], [[Union 76]] and [[Phillips 66]] gasoline and petroleum products and currently sells Marathon branded fuel.\n\n==Tulin telephone exchange==\n\nOdell Community once had its own telephone exchange, independent of the [[Bell System]].  The system was operated by the Johnson Family, who ran it from their boarding house on what is now Odell School Road.  The system was built in the years following World War I from surplus electrical equipment and telephone poles harvested from land in the community.

These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimizing required inputs of energy, water, food, [[waste]], output of heat, [[air pollution]] - {{CO2|link=yes}}, [[methane]], and [[water pollution]]. Richard Register first coined the term \"''ecocity''\" in his 1987 book ''Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future,'' where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecocity_Berkeley.html?id=QYE-Q8MAF3MC|title=Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future|last=Register|first=Richard|date=1987|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556430091|language=en}}</ref> Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.\n\nThere remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable. We can. reduce the effect by using bickes instead\n \n\nIdeally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Goals of a sustainable city are to be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and have the ability to power itself with [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]]. The central focus of this topic is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]] while also producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficiently using the land in ways such as [[compost]]ing used materials, [[recycling]], and/or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on [[climate change]]. The Adelaide City Council<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?204334/Adelaide-green-city|title=Adelaide green city {{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life.\n\nToday, 55% of the world is estimated to be living in [[urban area]]s and the [[United Nations]] estimates that by the year 2050, that number will rise to 68%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html|title=68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, says UN|date=2018-05-16|website=UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. [[Richard Florida]], an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.\n\n==Practical achievement==\nThese ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:\n*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).<!-- British form of 'center' --> This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).\n*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. \n*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the \"[[heat island effect]]\" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.\n*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.\n*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.\n*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perc.org/2012/03/22/how-can-cities-reverse-urban-sprawl-increase-transit-use-reduce-emissions/|title=How Can Cities Reverse Urban Sprawl, Increase Transit Use, Reduce Emissions?|date=2012-03-22|website=PERC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/10/what-neighborhood-revitalization-actually-looks/3627/|title=This Is What a Neighborhood Revitalization Actually Looks Like|last=Benfield|first=Kaid|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect.

Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.\n*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the number of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.\n*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.\n\n1== Architecture ==1\nBuildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.\n\n=== Eco-industrial park ===\nThe purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.\n\n==== Example ====\n\n===== Recycled Park in Rotterdam, The Netherlands =====\nThe Recycled Park in Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation, a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks, among other sustainable projects. Rotterdam's Recycled Park is a cluster of floating, green hexagonal \u201cislands\u201d composed of reused litter. The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recycledisland.com/litter-traps|title=Litter traps|website=Recycled Island|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> to collect this litter from the Maas River. The park's location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city.\n\nOn the underside of the recycled park are materials which will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area. This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam's natural elements is also reflected in other cities. Chicago's Urban Rivers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanriv.org/the-wild-mile|title=Home|website=Urban Rivers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the [[Chicago River]] with the goal of [[revegetation]]. Both Urban Rivers\u2019 and Recycled Island Foundation's interest in improving the area's biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city.\n\nRotterdam's Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts. The Floating Farm<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/floating-farm-rotterdam-cows-05-15-2019/|title=world's first floating farm welcomes cows in rotterdam|date=2019-05-15|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport. Other floating structures include renewable energy-powered houseboats<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/plus-31-architects-floating-houseboat-solar-power-naturecruiser-03-13-2019/|title=+31architects' floating houseboat uses solar power to sail across lakes and rivers|date=2019-03-13|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> and luxury residences some 800 meters from the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/wojciech-morsztyn-ocean-community-vessel-rising-sea-levels-luxury-houseboats-11-07-2019/|title=the 'ocean community' responds to rising sea levels with luxury houseboats|date=2019-11-07|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> The Dutch city of Amsterdam likewise boasts a neighborhood of artificial, floating islands in the suburb of [[IJburg]].\n\nThe idea of expanding both commercial enterprise and residential developments onto the water is oftentimes reflective of the demand to limit land-usage in urban areas. This has various, wide-reaching environmental impacts: reducing the aggregation of the [[Urban heat island|urban heat-island effect]], the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the [[floodplain]] (and potentially, the capacity of [[Wastewater|waste-water reservoirs]]), and reduce the demands of the [[automobility]] state.\n\nThe Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste. The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects, to reduce pollution. Additionally, the modular, hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each \u201cisland;\u201d this space thus also offers environmental sustainability, as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities.\n\n=== Urban farming ===\n{{See also|Urban Agriculture}}\n\n[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruaf.org/|title=The RUAF Foundation|website=The RUAF Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> Such linkages include the use of urban residents as laborers; use of typical urban resources (such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation); direct links with urban consumers; direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative); being part of the urban food system; competing for land with other urban functions; being influenced by urban policies and plans. One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cites includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.\n\n=== New Urbanism ===\nThe most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the [[built environment]] to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.\n\n[[Sustainable architecture]], a recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]], promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture and opposes solitary [[housing estate]]s and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\n\n=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===\n{{Main|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design}}\n\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u00ae encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\n\nLEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations & Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.\n\n=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===\nSustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.\n\nIn SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]<nowiki/>many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Energy Efficiency of different Transport Modes.png|thumb]]\nAs major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city's reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].\n\nDue to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city's energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.\n\nThe [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.\n\n=== Car free city ===\nThe concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[pedestrian area]]s is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.\n\n=== Emphasis on proximity ===\nCreated by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.\nTransportation in downtown [[Chicago]]\nFurthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.\n\nSee also: [[Compact city]] and [[Pocket neighborhood]]\n\n=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===\nSustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.\n\nAmong the different [[modes of transport]]ation, the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[walking path]]s remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement. We can reduce this by using bikes instead.\n\n=== Access to transportation ===\nIn order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.\n\nIn order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.\n\n== Urban strategic planning ==\nAlthough there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Universit\u00e0 del Salento and Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12\u201314 October 2016.\n\n=== Development ===\nRecently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.\n\n=== Obstacles ===\nThe City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.\n\n=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===\nAccording to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authorities, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.\n\n==Examples==\n===Australia===\n\n==== Adelaide ====\n'''Urban forests'''\n\nIn [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.\n\n'''Solar power'''\n\nThe Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.\n\n'''Wind power'''\n\nSouth Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.\n\n'''Waste recycling'''\n\nFor Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.\n\n[[Melbourne]]\n\n* [[City of Moreland]]. The City of Moreland in Melbourne's north, has programs for becoming carbon neutral, one of which is '[https://web.archive.org/web/20160407004537/http://www.morelandsolarcity.org.au/ Zero Carbon Moreland]', amongst other existing sustainable implementations and proposals.\n* [[City of Melbourne]]. Over the past 10 years, various methods of improving public transport have been implemented, car free zones and entire streets have also been implemented.\n\n==== City of Greater Taree, New South Wales ====\nThe [[City of Greater Taree]] north of Sydney has developed a masterplan for Australia's first low-to-no carbon urban development.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n'''Belo Horizonte, Brazil''' was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolis in Brazil, with 2.4 million inhabitants. The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte (2010\u20132030) is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities' infrastructure, incorporating the role of local government, state government, city leaders and encouraging citizen participation. The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government. Overall, the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape.

The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe's most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.\n* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful. By converting roads to spaces for festivals, farmer markets, bikes, and walkability it promotes a healthier lifestyle and potentially a happier one.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n* Norra \u00c4lvstranden (Swedish), in [[Gothenburg]] by the river [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]], is an example of a sustainable city in Sweden.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> It has low environmental impact, and contains passive houses, recycling system for waste, etc.\n* [[Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad]]<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* V\u00e4stra Hamnen or [[Bo01]], Malm\u00f6<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* Stockholm Royal Seaport\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n\n* [[Masdar City]], [[Abu Dhabi]] is a planned city that relies entirely on solar energy and other renewable energy sources, with a sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste ecology.\n* [[Dubai The Sustainable City]], [[Dubai]]\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n* [[London Borough of Sutton]] is the first One Planet Region in the United Kingdom, with significant targets for reducing the ecological footprint of residents and creating the UK's greenest borough.\n* [[Middlesbrough]] is another One Planet Region in the United Kingdom.\n* [[St Davids]], the smallest city in the United Kingdom, aims to be the first carbon neutral city in the world.\n* [[Leicester]] is the United Kingdom's first environment city.\n\n===United States===\n* [[Arcosanti]], Arizona\n* [[Treasure Island development|Treasure Island]], San Francisco: is another project that aims to create a small eco city.\n*[[Coyote Springs, Nevada|Coyote Springs]] Nevada largest planned city in the [[United States]].\n*[[Babcock Ranch Florida|Babcock Ranch]] Florida a proposed solar-powered city.\n*[[Douglass Ranch in Buckeye]] Arizona\n*[[Mesa del Sol]] in [[Albuquerque]],New Mexico\n*Sonoma Mountain Village in Rohnert Park, California*\n\n==See also==\n[[Sustainable design|See also the Sustainability navigational box at the bottom of the page.]]\n\n* [[2000-watt society]]\n* [[BedZED]]\n* [[Bicycle City]]\n* [[Carfree city]]\n* [[Circles of Sustainability]]\n* [[Covenant of Mayors]]\n* [[Eco-cities]]\n* [[Ecodistrict]]\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Floating ecopolis]]\n* [[Global Ecovillage Network]]\n* [[Prix Versailles]]\n* [[Sustainable design]]\n* [[Sustainable urbanism]]\n* [[Transition town]]\n* [[Urban design]]\n* [[Zero-carbon city]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Helmut Bott, Gregor Grassl, Stephan Anders (2019) [https://shop.detail.de/eu_e/sustainable-urban-planning.html Sustainable Urban Planning: Vibrant Neighbourhoods \u2013 Smart Cities \u2013 Resilience], DETAIL Publishers, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-3-95553-462-2}}\n*Stanislav E.

These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimizing required inputs of energy, water, food, [[waste]], output of heat, [[air pollution]] - {{CO2|link=yes}}, [[methane]], and [[water pollution]]. Richard Register first coined the term \"''ecocity''\" in his 1987 book ''Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future,'' where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecocity_Berkeley.html?id=QYE-Q8MAF3MC|title=Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future|last=Register|first=Richard|date=1987|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556430091|language=en}}</ref> Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.\n\nThere remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.\n\nIdeally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Goals of a sustainable city are to be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and have the ability to power itself with [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]]. The central focus of this topic is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]] while also producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficiently using the land in ways such as [[compost]]ing used materials, [[recycling]], and/or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on [[climate change]]. The Adelaide City Council<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?204334/Adelaide-green-city|title=Adelaide green city {{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life.\n\nToday, 55% of the world is estimated to be living in [[urban area]]s and the [[United Nations]] estimates that by the year 2050, that number will rise to 68%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html|title=68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, says UN|date=2018-05-16|website=UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. [[Richard Florida]], an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.\n\n==Practical achievement==\nThese ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:\n*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).<!-- British form of 'center' --> This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).\n*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. \n*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the \"[[heat island effect]]\" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.\n*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.\n*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.\n*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perc.org/2012/03/22/how-can-cities-reverse-urban-sprawl-increase-transit-use-reduce-emissions/|title=How Can Cities Reverse Urban Sprawl, Increase Transit Use, Reduce Emissions?|date=2012-03-22|website=PERC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/10/what-neighborhood-revitalization-actually-looks/3627/|title=This Is What a Neighborhood Revitalization Actually Looks Like|last=Benfield|first=Kaid|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Incorporating [[Green roof|eco roofs]] or green roofs in your design will help with air quality, climate and water runoff.\n*[[Zero-emission transport]]\n*[[Zero-energy building]]\n*[[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] or SUDS\n*[[Energy conservation|energy conservation systems/devices]]\n*[[Xeriscaping]] - garden and landscape design for water conservation\n*[[Sustainable transport]], incorporates five elements: fuel economy, occupancy, electrification, pedal power, and urbanization.\n*[[Key Performance Indicator]]s - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&V for city administrators\n*Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI,Voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.\n*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the number of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.\n*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.\n\n== Architecture ==\nBuildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.\n\n=== Eco-industrial park ===\nThe purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.\n\n==== Example ====\n\n===== Recycled Park in Rotterdam, The Netherlands =====\nThe Recycled Park in Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation, a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks, among other sustainable projects. Rotterdam's Recycled Park is a cluster of floating, green hexagonal \u201cislands\u201d composed of reused litter. The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recycledisland.com/litter-traps|title=Litter traps|website=Recycled Island|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> to collect this litter from the Maas River. The park's location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city.\n\nOn the underside of the recycled park are materials which will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area. This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam's natural elements is also reflected in other cities. Chicago's Urban Rivers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanriv.org/the-wild-mile|title=Home|website=Urban Rivers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the [[Chicago River]] with the goal of [[revegetation]]. Both Urban Rivers\u2019 and Recycled Island Foundation's interest in improving the area's biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city.\n\nRotterdam's Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts. The Floating Farm<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/floating-farm-rotterdam-cows-05-15-2019/|title=world's first floating farm welcomes cows in rotterdam|date=2019-05-15|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport. Other floating structures include renewable energy-powered houseboats<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/plus-31-architects-floating-houseboat-solar-power-naturecruiser-03-13-2019/|title=+31architects' floating houseboat uses solar power to sail across lakes and rivers|date=2019-03-13|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> and luxury residences some 800 meters from the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/wojciech-morsztyn-ocean-community-vessel-rising-sea-levels-luxury-houseboats-11-07-2019/|title=the 'ocean community' responds to rising sea levels with luxury houseboats|date=2019-11-07|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> The Dutch city of Amsterdam likewise boasts a neighborhood of artificial, floating islands in the suburb of [[IJburg]].\n\nThe idea of expanding both commercial enterprise and residential developments onto the water is oftentimes reflective of the demand to limit land-usage in urban areas. This has various, wide-reaching environmental impacts: reducing the aggregation of the [[Urban heat island|urban heat-island effect]], the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the [[floodplain]] (and potentially, the capacity of [[Wastewater|waste-water reservoirs]]), and reduce the demands of the [[automobility]] state.\n\nThe Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste. The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects, to reduce pollution. Additionally, the modular, hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each \u201cisland;\u201d this space thus also offers environmental sustainability, as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities.\n\n=== Urban farming ===\n{{See also|Urban Agriculture}}\n\n[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruaf.org/|title=The RUAF Foundation|website=The RUAF Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> Such linkages include the use of urban residents as laborers; use of typical urban resources (such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation); direct links with urban consumers; direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative); being part of the urban food system; competing for land with other urban functions; being influenced by urban policies and plans. One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cites includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.\n\n=== New Urbanism ===\nThe most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the [[built environment]] to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.\n\n[[Sustainable architecture]], a recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]], promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture and opposes solitary [[housing estate]]s and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\n\n=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===\n{{Main|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design}}\n\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u00ae encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\n\nLEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations & Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.\n\n=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===\nSustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.\n\nIn SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]<nowiki/>many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Energy Efficiency of different Transport Modes.png|thumb]]\nAs major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city's reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].\n\nDue to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city's energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.\n\nThe [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.\n\n=== Car free city ===\nThe concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[pedestrian area]]s is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.\n\n=== Emphasis on proximity ===\nCreated by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.\nTransportation in downtown [[Chicago]]\nFurthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.\n\nSee also: [[Compact city]] and [[Pocket neighborhood]]\n\n=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===\nSustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.\n\nAmong the different [[modes of transport]]ation, the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[walking path]]s remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.\n\n=== Access to transportation ===\nIn order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.\n\nIn order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.\n\n== Urban strategic planning ==\nAlthough there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Universit\u00e0 del Salento and Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12\u201314 October 2016.\n\n=== Development ===\nRecently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.\n\n=== Obstacles ===\nThe City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.\n\n=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===\nAccording to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authorities, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.\n\n==Examples==\n===Australia===\n\n==== Adelaide ====\n'''Urban forests'''\n\nIn [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.\n\n'''Solar power'''\n\nThe Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.\n\n'''Wind power'''\n\nSouth Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.\n\n'''Waste recycling'''\n\nFor Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.\n\n[[Melbourne]]\n\n* [[City of Moreland]]. The City of Moreland in Melbourne's north, has programs for becoming carbon neutral, one of which is '[https://web.archive.org/web/20160407004537/http://www.morelandsolarcity.org.au/ Zero Carbon Moreland]', amongst other existing sustainable implementations and proposals.\n* [[City of Melbourne]]. Over the past 10 years, various methods of improving public transport have been implemented, car free zones and entire streets have also been implemented.\n\n==== City of Greater Taree, New South Wales ====\nThe [[City of Greater Taree]] north of Sydney has developed a masterplan for Australia's first low-to-no carbon urban development.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n'''Belo Horizonte, Brazil''' was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolis in Brazil, with 2.4 million inhabitants. The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte (2010\u20132030) is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities' infrastructure, incorporating the role of local government, state government, city leaders and encouraging citizen participation. The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government. Overall, the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape.

An additional project was made in 2007 in this area: an Eco-Village based on the concept made by an Italian professor from the School of Architecture of Tianjin University.\n* [[Huangbaiyu]], [[Benxi]], [[Liaoning]] is a small village of 42 homes that has come under great criticism: most of the homes are unoccupied by villagers.\n* [[Nanjing]]: As of April 2008, an ecocity collaboration project is being proposed here.\n* [[Rizhao]], [[Shandong]] mandates solar water heaters for households, and has been designated the Environmental Model City by China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration|SEPA]].\n* [[Chengdu Tianfu District Great City]] is a planned city located just outside [[Chengdu]] that is planned to be sustainable and has the goal of being a self-sustaining city that discourages the use of cars.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nTwo comprehensive studies were carried out for the whole of Denmark in 2010 (The IDA Climate Plan 2050) and 2011 (The Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy). The studies analysed the benefits and obstacles of running Denmark on [[100% renewable energy]] from the year 2050. There is also a larger, ambitious plan in action: the Copenhagen 2025 Climate Plan.\n\nOn a more local level, the [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|industrial park in Kalundborg]] is often cited as a model for industrial ecology. However, projects have been carried out in several Danish cities promoting 100% renewable energy. Examples include [[Aalborg]], [[Ballerup]] and [[Frederikshavn]]. [[Aalborg University]] has launched a master education program on sustainable cities (Sustainable Cities @ Aalborg University Copenhagen). See also the Danish Wikipedia.\n\n* [[Copenhagen]]: [[Cycling in Copenhagen]]: One of the most bicycle-friendly city's in the world where over 50% of the population get around on bikes. The city has infrastructure that caters to cycling with hundreds of kilometres of curb segregated bike lanes to separate cyclists and car traffic. A notable feature is The Cycle Super Highways that feature elevated bike lanes which ensures fast, unhindered travel between destinations.\n\n=== Ecuador ===\n[[Loja, Ecuador]] won three international prizes for the sustainability efforts begun by its mayor Dr. Jose Bolivar Castillo.<ref name=\"Worldwatch\">[[Worldwatch Institute]].

It is one of the few cities with a [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] mayor and is known for its strong solar energy industry. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be carfree. Another green district in Freiburg is Rieselfeld, where houses generate more energy than they consume. There are several other green sustainable city projects such as Kronsberg in Hannover and current developments around Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt.\n\n* [[Berlin]]: The [[Tiergarten (park)]] is a large park that takes up 520 acres and is an example of social sustainability where it is a green space but also used for transportation. The Tiergarten has inter paths where people can safely bike and walk without the disturbance of cars. Paths connect to notable areas within the city, such as government buildings, shopping areas and monuments.\n* [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] is often referred to{{by whom|date=September 2019}} as green city. It is known for its strong solar economy. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be car-free.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nThe government portrays the proposed [[Hung Shui Kiu]] [[new town]] as an eco-city. The same happened with the urban development plan on the site of the former [[Kai Tak Airport]].\n\n=== Ireland ===\nSouth Dublin County Council announced plans in late 2007 to develop Clonburris, a new suburb of Dublin to include up to 15,000 new homes, to be designed to achieve the highest of international standards. The plans for Clonburris include countless green innovations such as high levels of energy efficiency, mandatory renewable energy for heating and electricity, the use of recycled and sustainable building materials, a district heating system for distributing heat, the provision of allotments for growing food, and even the banning of tumble driers, with natural drying areas being provided instead.\n\nIn 2012 an energy plan was carried out by the Danish [[Aalborg University]] for the municipalities of [[Limerick]] and [[County Clare|Clare]]. The project was a short-term 2020 renewable energy strategy giving a 20% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions are beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy.\n\n===India===\n[[India]] is working on [[Gujarat International Finance Tec-City]] or GIFT which is an under-construction world-class city in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]]. It will come up on 500 acres (2.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) land.<ref>http://giftgujarat.in/ Gujarat International Finance Tec-City plans</ref> It will also be first of its kind fully Sustainable City.\nAuroville was founded in 1968 with the intention of realizing human unity, and is now home to approximately 2,000 individuals from over 45 nations around the world. Its focus is its vibrant community culture and its expertise in renewable energy systems, habitat restoration, ecology skills, mindfulness practices, and holistic education.\nAndhra Pradesh state New capital also coming up with a future sustainable city.\n\n=== Korea ===\n[[Songdo International Business District|Songdo IBD]] is a planned city in [[Incheon]] which has incorporated a number of eco-friendly features. These include a central park irrigated with seawater, a subway line, bicycle lanes, rainwater catchment systems, and pneumatic waste collection system. 75% of the waste generated by the construction of the city will be recycled.\n\nGwanggyo City Centre is another planned sustainable city.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nAs of 2014 a Low Carbon Cities programme is being piloted in Malaysia by KeTTHA, the Malaysian Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (GreenTech Malaysia) and the [[Carbon Trust]].\n\n[[Malacca]] has a stated ambition to become a carbon-free city, taking steps towards creating a smart electricity grid. This is being done as part of an initiative to create a Green Special Economic Zone, where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology, creating up to 300,000 new green jobs.\n\nThe Federal Department of Town and Country Planning (FDTCP) in peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of the Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development (MURNInets)MURNInets includes 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under six dimensions. Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities. In MURNInets at least three main new features are introduced. These include the Happiness Index, an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the well-being of the community. Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authorities' services. Through the introduction of these indicators the bottom-up approach in measuring sustainability is adopted.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe city of [[Waitakere]], the Western part of the greater [[Auckland]] urban region, was [[New Zealand]]'s first eco-city, working from the Greenprint, a guiding document that the City Council developed in the early 1990s.\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[Clark Freeport Zone]] is a former United States Air Force base in the Philippines. It is located on the northwest side of Angeles City and on the west side of Mabalacat City in the province of Pampanga, about 40 miles (60&nbsp;km) northwest of Metro Manila. A multi-billion project will convert the 36,000 hectare former Clark Air Force Base into a mix of industrial, commercial and institutional areas of green environment. The heart of the project is a 9,450-hectare metropolis dubbed as the \"[[Clark Green City]]\". Builders will use the green building system for environmentally-friendly structures. Its facilities will tap renewable energy such as solar and hydro power.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe organization Living PlanIT is currently constructing a city from scratch near Porto, Portugal. Buildings will be electronically connected to vehicles giving the user a sense of personal eco-friendliness.\n\n=== Spain ===\n\n* [[Bilbao]]: The city faced economic turmoil following the decline of the steel and port industries but through communication between stakeholders and authorities to create inner-city transformation, the local government benefited from the increase in land value in old port areas. The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe's most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.\n* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful. By converting roads to spaces for festivals, farmer markets, bikes, and walkability it promotes a healthier lifestyle and potentially a happier one.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n* Norra \u00c4lvstranden (Swedish), in [[Gothenburg]] by the river [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]], is an example of a sustainable city in Sweden.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> It has low environmental impact, and contains passive houses, recycling system for waste, etc.\n* [[Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad]]<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* V\u00e4stra Hamnen or [[Bo01]], Malm\u00f6<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* Stockholm Royal Seaport\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n\n* [[Masdar City]], [[Abu Dhabi]] is a planned city that relies entirely on solar energy and other renewable energy sources, with a sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste ecology.\n* [[Dubai The Sustainable City]], [[Dubai]]\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n* [[London Borough of Sutton]] is the first One Planet Region in the United Kingdom, with significant targets for reducing the ecological footprint of residents and creating the UK's greenest borough.\n* [[Middlesbrough]] is another One Planet Region in the United Kingdom.\n* [[St Davids]], the smallest city in the United Kingdom, aims to be the first carbon neutral city in the world.\n* [[Leicester]] is the United Kingdom's first environment city.\n\n===United States===\n* [[Arcosanti]], Arizona\n* [[Treasure Island development|Treasure Island]], San Francisco: is another project that aims to create a small eco city.\n*[[Coyote Springs, Nevada|Coyote Springs]] Nevada largest planned city in the [[United States]].\n*[[Babcock Ranch Florida|Babcock Ranch]] Florida a proposed solar-powered city.\n*[[Douglass Ranch in Buckeye]] Arizona\n*[[Mesa del Sol]] in [[Albuquerque]],New Mexico\n*Sonoma Mountain Village in Rohnert Park, California*\n\n==See also==\n[[Sustainable design|See also the Sustainability navigational box at the bottom of the page.]]\n\n* [[2000-watt society]]\n* [[BedZED]]\n* [[Bicycle City]]\n* [[Carfree city]]\n* [[Circles of Sustainability]]\n* [[Covenant of Mayors]]\n* [[Eco-cities]]\n* [[Ecodistrict]]\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Floating ecopolis]]\n* [[Global Ecovillage Network]]\n* [[Prix Versailles]]\n* [[Sustainable design]]\n* [[Sustainable urbanism]]\n* [[Transition town]]\n* [[Urban design]]\n* [[Zero-carbon city]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Helmut Bott, Gregor Grassl, Stephan Anders (2019) [https://shop.detail.de/eu_e/sustainable-urban-planning.html Sustainable Urban Planning: Vibrant Neighbourhoods \u2013 Smart Cities \u2013 Resilience], DETAIL Publishers, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-3-95553-462-2}}\n*Stanislav E.

Spence represented Silkwood's father and children, who charged that Kerr-McGee was responsible for exposing Silkwood to dangerous levels of [[radiation]]. Spence won a $10.5&nbsp;million verdict for the family.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the family's right to sue under state law for punitive damages from a federally regulated industry.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120907053624/http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:4422034&ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20c:DocG:Result&ao= Silkwood Case Laid To Rest], August 30, 1986, Science News.</ref> The Silkwood case achieved international fame and was the subject of many books, magazine and newspaper articles and the major motion picture [[Silkwood]] starring [[Merryl Streep]] as Karen Silkwood.\n\n===Other cases===\nAfter the Silkwood case, Spence tried a number of high-profile cases.
