The series premiered on [[CBS]] on July 7, 2011 and lasted ten weeks until the live finale on September 14, 2011. The 13th season continued to have an increase in ratings, much like the previous two seasons had. The season premiered to a total of 7.89&nbsp;million viewers, a slight increase from the previous season's launch. The season finale had a total of 7.78&nbsp;million viewers, only slightly lower than the previous season. In total, the series averaged 7.95&nbsp;million viewers, higher than that of the previous three seasons and the highest since ''Big Brother 5'' in 2004. ''Big Brother 13'' featured a total of 14 HouseGuests, six of which were previous HouseGuests from past seasons. The series ended after 75 days, in which returning HouseGuest [[Rachel Reilly (Big Brother)|Rachel Reilly]] was crowned the Winner, while new HouseGuest Porsche Briggs was crowned the Runner-up.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Big Brother 13'' was produced by [[Endemol#Endemol USA|Endemol USA]] and Fly on the Wall Entertainment, with [[Allison Grodner]] and Rich Meehan returning as executive producers.

The first change was the HouseGuests pairing up into seven teams of two. The eight new HouseGuests were allowed to get to know one another and form duos as they saw fit. The six returning veteran HouseGuests were already paired up prior to entering the House. The second change was when a HouseGuest won the weekly Head of Household competition their respective partner received immunity from eviction as well. The Head of Household nominated a pair for eviction rather than two individual HouseGuests. The third change was the introduction of the \"Big Brother Golden Key\" which was given to the remaining member of the nominated pair that survived an eviction vote or lost a partner due to an expulsion or voluntary exit. The Big Brother Golden Key guaranteed this HouseGuest a spot in the top ten and immunity from all challenges and eviction.

if there was a tie, the contestant who drank the fastest would receive a point for their team. Jeff, Jordan, Rachel, and Shelly lost and became the Have-Nots for the week. The public voted for the Have-Nots to have [[coconuts]] and [[catfish]] in addition to slop. Later that evening Rachel and Jeff were nominated for eviction by Kalia. The following day Jeff won the Power of Veto competition, ''Big Brother Odyssey'', by being the first HouseGuest to roll a ball back and forth with the first person to reach 300 points declared the winner. Jeff saved himself from eviction on Day 37 and Kalia nominated Lawon for eviction after he volunteered to become the nominee. Lawon was evicted on Day 41 by a unanimous vote. In an unprecedented move, he volunteered to be evicted thinking the upcoming twist would return him to the House.\n\nAfter the eviction results were announced the HouseGuests were informed of the full twist. Meanwhile, Keith, Cassi, Dominic and Brendon re-entered the House through the backyard to find out which one of the four would compete to regain HouseGuest status. Brendon was chosen to return to the House after receiving 39.5% of the public vote for a chance to return. Keith, Cassi and Dominic then exited the House. Brendon and Lawon then competed in the competition  ''That's How We Roll''. The object was to be the first person to create a complete set of fourteen multi-colored balls, each one named for one of the fourteen original HouseGuests. The player with the complete set in the fastest locked time would regain HouseGuest status. If neither player finished a complete set, the person who successfully shot the first ball would automatically win. At the start of the battle Big Brother released one hundred and fifty balls into the backyard. Brendon shot a complete set at about 2:40 and regained HouseGuest status on Day 41.\n\nLater that evening Daniele won her second Head of Household competition, ''Count on America''. Shelly and Adam were nominated for eviction the next day by Daniele. Adam won the Power of Veto competition, ''Big Brother [[Cornhole]]'', on Day 43 and saved himself from eviction on Day 46. During the competition, HouseGuests competing won a variety of prizes including, a Caribbean Vacation for Kalia, $5,000 for Jeff, a Veto ticket for Daniele ensuring her a spot in next week's Veto competition, 24-hour solitary confinement for Shelly with the privilege of receiving a phone call from home, and a \"humilitard\" to be worn by Jordan for a week. Daniele then nominated Brendon for eviction alongside Shelly. After a 5\u20131 vote in Shelly's favor, Brendon was once again evicted from the house and became the first Jury member.\n\nFollowing Brendon's eviction, the remaining eligible HouseGuests competed in the game, ''All Washed Up''. HouseGuests had to retrieve a ping-pong ball from within a container, by using a small cup to transfer Liquid Detergent across the yard while on a slippery surface. Jeff was the first to do so, and became the new Head of Household. Unbeknownst to the HouseGuests, Julie Chen announced to the viewers that Day 55 of the competition will be a Double Eviction night. Jeff nominated Porsche and Kalia for eviction. However, after he also won Power of Veto he removed Porsche from the block and replaced her with Daniele. On Day 55, Daniele was evicted on a 3\u20132 vote, becoming the second Jury member. However, the HouseGuests were informed on eviction night that it was ''Big Brother Fast Forward'', with a Head of Household competition, nomination ceremony, Veto competition and ceremony, and eviction vote all occurring on the same day. Kalia won the Head of Household competition ''Before or After'' and nominated Rachel and Jeff. Porsche won the Power of Veto in a competition called ''Clowning Around'', and chose not to use it. As a result of a tie in the eviction votes, Kalia, as HoH, voted to evict Jeff, making him the seventh evicted housemate of the season, the eighth evictee, and the third member of the Jury.\n\nFollowing Danielle and Jeff's eviction, Porsche won Week 8's HoH competition, ''Snake-Eyes'', and nominated the two remaining veterans, Jordan and Rachel, for eviction. As HoH, Porsche decided to open ''Pandora's Box (PB)'', and was awarded $10,000 that she had to split with one other player. She chose Kalia. The other part of Pandora's Box was the return of the Duo Twist for Week 8 only.  Porsche chose Kalia, Rachel chose Jordan, and Adam chose Shelly. Rachel won the ''Duo Do Over'' PoV competition, and removed Jordan and herself from the block. Porsche was left with one alternative duo \u2013 Adam & Shelly. Shelly was evicted by a 2\u20131 vote, making her the fourth member of the Jury, and the first newbie on the Jury.\n\nFollowing Shelly's eviction, The HouseGuest then competed inWeek 9's HoH competition, ''Rollin' in the Dough'', was won by Rachel. A ''Pandora's Box'' twist was offered to Rachel which led to [[Tori Spelling]] entering the house on Day 64. Kalia and Porsche were nominated for eviction. Adam won Power of Veto and let the nominations stand. As part of a second Double Eviction week, Kalia was evicted by 2\u20131 vote, with HoH Rachel casting the tie-breaking vote after Jordan voted to evict Porsche and Adam voted to evict Kalia. Kalia became the fifth Jury member, and the second newbie on the Jury. The HouseGuest then competed in the second HoH competition of the week, ''Big Brother Fortune Teller'', was won by Adam on Day 68.  He nominated Porsche and Jordan for eviction.

Rachel replaced her as the only possible alternative nominee. Immediately, Porsche cast the sole vote to evict Jordan who became the sixth member of the jury and the fourth veteran.\n\nFollowing Kalia and Jordan's eviction, Week 10's HoH competition had three parts. The final three HouseGuests began playing ''Big Brother Mixer'' to determine the winner of the first part. Adam was eliminated after 29 minutes. [[Rachel Reilly (Big Brother)|Rachel]] won when Porsche fell after 48 minutes into the competition. Porsche and Adam competed in the second part, an underwater challenge, which Porsche ultimately won. Rachel and Porsche competed in the third part of the HoH competition which Rachel won and became the Final HoH. She evicted Adam, who became the seventh and final member of the jury. By a jury vote of 4\u20133 Rachel won the $500,000 grand prize. She gained Brendon, Jeff, Jordan, and Shelly's vote while Adam, Daniele, and Kalia voted for Porsche.

Due to the fact that the duos were still in play, the Veto winner had a choice to remove the nominated duo from eviction. The duo of the veto winner is listed in orange. \n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: A live battle was held after the eviction and before the Head of Household competition on Day 41 to determine which evicted HouseGuest would be able to return to the House. The viewing public voted all week for Keith, Cassi, Dominic or Brendon to participate in the live battle. Brendon won the public vote and competed against Lawon, the then most recent evictee. Brendon won the battle and was reinstated as a full HouseGuest eligible to win.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: As Head of Household, Kalia was forced to break the tie on Day 55.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: Porsche opened Pandora's Box on Day 56 which reactivated the Duos twist. The remaining six were put into new duos for the week. The new duos are Adam & Shelly (A), Jordan & Rachel (B), and Kalia & Porsche (C). \n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: As Head of Household, Rachel was forced to break the tie on Day 67.\n*{{note|9|Note 9}}: During the finale, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as ''The Jury of 7'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Viewing figures===\n\"Rating\" is the estimated percentage of all televisions tuned to the show, and \"share\" is the percentage of all televisions ''in use'' that are tuned in. \"Viewers\" is the estimated number viewers that watched a program either while it was broadcast or watched via [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] on the same day the program was broadcast.

Jeff didn't think it was appropriate to have a gay headmaster locked away with children in a magical land. When fellow House Guest Kalia Booker challenged Jeff on making this statement, saying there was nothing wrong with teachers that identify as gay, Jeff rejected her viewpoint and accused her of being politically correct for the audience.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/big-brothers-jeff-schroeder-goes-210798 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Big Brother's' Jeff Schroeder Goes on Homophobic Rant About 'Harry Potter's' Dumbledore | date=July 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/big_brother_13/2011_Jul_13_jeff_homophobic_rant |title=Jeff Schroeder goes on a homophobic rant prompted by Harry Potter's Dumbledore + reality blurred |publisher=Realityblurred.com |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe conversation was posted online but was shortly removed by RealNetworks under the grounds of copyright and infringement. A couple of websites later posted full transcripts of the argument online shortly after. CBS released a public statement the following day regarding Jeff's comment, stating that any views or opinions expressed by the HouseGuests are those of the individual and not the network or producers of the program.<ref name=\"Inside TV EW.com\">{{cite news| url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/07/13/jeff-schroeder-big-brother/ |title=CBS responds to homophobic comments made in 'Big Brother' house|author= Lynette Rice |date= July 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) responded to the controversy by referring to Jeff as an \"openly anti-gay reality star\". After recounting the various programs he has taken part of (a contestant in ''[[The Amazing Race 16|''The Amazing Race'']]'', host of the second season of ''[[Around the World for Free]]'' web series and two seasons of ''Big Brother''), GLAAD alleged that the network knew Jeff would bring his \"openly anti-gay attitudes\" back to the program and questioned if the network had cast him for that purpose.<ref name=\"Inside TV EW.com\"/>\n\nAfter Jeff was evicted in a double eviction week on Day 55, Shelly Moore received heavy criticism from the show's fans, who held her responsible for his eviction. Her family later received phone calls that contained violent threats, including some aimed at her 8-year-old daughter, while her employer has also received phone calls calling for her termination. Allison Grodner, the executive producer of ''Big Brother'', posted a message on her Twitter account regarding the incidents.<ref name=ShellyThreat>{{cite web|last=TMZ Staff|title=Shelly's Family Receives Death Threats Over Jeff's Eviction|url=https://www.tmz.com/2011/08/28/big-brother-shelly-moore-death-threats-jeff-schroeder-daughter-phone-calls-kill-fbi-cbs/|work=TMZ.com|publisher=EHM Productions, Inc.|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alleged rigging from production===\nDuring week 8, a controversial Pandora's Box twist left fans wondering if production was fixing the game for certain players. As Head of Household for the week, Porsche Briggs openly identified her targets as the last two returning HouseGuests, Jordan Lloyd and Rachel Reilly. But when Porsche opened Pandora's Box, she unleashed the return of the duos twist, making both Rachel and Jordan a duo. Only one of them needed to win the Power of Veto to keep both of them safe from eviction. Fans suspected that the return of the duos twist was a ploy by production to keep both women in the game, as the remaining HouseGuests had made a contingency plan to vote out whichever veteran did not win the Power of Veto. These suspicions heightened after the Power of Veto competition was merely a redux of an earlier competition that Reilly had won. Houseguest Kalia Booker even suspected that the competition had not been properly tested, suggesting it had been thrown together at the last minute.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langston |first=Michael |url=http://www.themortonreport.com/features/is-big-brother-13-rigged/ |title=Is Big Brother 13 Rigged? |publisher=The Morton Report |date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> Rachel would go on to win the veto competition, saving herself and Jordan while forcing Porsche to nominate Adam Poch and Shelly Moore by default, as they were the only pair left for Porsche to put on the block.

The first change was the HouseGuests pairing up into seven teams of two. The eight new HouseGuests were allowed to get to know one another and form duos as they saw fit. The six returning veteran HouseGuests were already paired up prior to entering the House. The second change was when a HouseGuest won the weekly Head of Household competition their respective partner received immunity from eviction as well. The Head of Household nominated a pair for eviction rather than two individual HouseGuests. The third change was the introduction of the \"Big Brother Golden Key\" which was given to the remaining member of the nominated pair that survived an eviction vote or lost a partner due to an expulsion or voluntary exit. The Big Brother Golden Key guaranteed this HouseGuest a spot in the top ten and immunity from all challenges and eviction. However, the recipients of the Golden Key were still required to vote to evict during the live eviction shows.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n\n{{main|List of Big Brother 13 houseguests (U.S.)}}\n\n[[File:Bigbrother13cast.jpg|thumb|400px|<center>'''The cast of the thirteenth season of ''Big Brother''.'''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jordan, Shelly and Rachel<hr />'''Middle:''' Jeff, Keith, Adam, Brendon, Daniele, Dominic, Cassi, and Dick<hr />'''Bottom:''' Kalia, Porsche and Lawon]]\n\n===New HouseGuests===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; \n|-\n!Name\n!Age on entry\n!Occupation\n!Residence\n!Day entered\n!Day exited\n!Result\n|-\n| {{sortname|Porsche|Briggs|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Porsche}}\n| 23\n| [[Cocktail waitress]]\n| {{sortname|Miami Beach,|Florida}}\n| 1\n| 75\n| {{Runner-up}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Adam|Poch|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Adam}}\n| 39\n| [[Inventory|Music inventory manager]]\n| {{sortname|Hoboken,|New Jersey}}\n| 1\n| 75\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Kalia|Booker|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Kalia}}\n| 30\n| Writer\n| {{sortname|Los Angeles,|California}}\n| 1\n| 67\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Shelly|Moore|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Shelly}}\n| 41\n| [[Executive (management)|Outdoor industry executive]]\n| {{sortname| Prairieville,| Louisiana}}\n| 1\n| 62\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Lawon|Exum|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Lawon}}\n| 39\n| [[Clerk|Legal file clerk]]\n| {{sortname|Inglewood,|California}}\n| 1\n| 41\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Dominic|Briones|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Dominic}}\n| 25\n| [[Student|College student]] & Model\n| {{sortname|San Mateo,|California}}\n| 1\n| 27\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Cassi|Colvin|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Cassi}}\n| 26\n| Model\n| {{sortname|Nashville,|Tennessee}}\n| 1\n| 20\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Keith|Henderson|List of Big Brother 13 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Keith}}\n| 32\n| [[Human resource management|Human resources manager]]\n| {{sortname|Bolingbrook,|Illinois}}\n| 1\n| 13\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|}\n\n===Returning HouseGuests===\n\nAs part of the twist for this edition, a selection of former HouseGuests, called \"Dynamic Duos\" by the producers, re-entered the House for another chance to win the grand prize.<ref name=\"HG-1\">{{cite web|last=Scheffler |first=Brian |title=Meet the Big Brother 13 Houseguests, Plus Twist Details |url=http://www.welovebigbrother.com/meet-the-big-brother-13-houseguests-on-welovebigbrother-com |publisher=ScheffTech Productions, LLC |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703092740/http://www.welovebigbrother.com/meet-the-big-brother-13-houseguests-on-welovebigbrother-com |archivedate=July 3, 2011 |date=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Prior to the premiere episode, CBS posted a poll of six pairs of former HouseGuests, asking the public to vote on which couple they think would re-enter the House.

Jeff, Jordan, Rachel, and Shelly lost and became the Have-Nots for the week. The public voted for the Have-Nots to have [[coconuts]] and [[catfish]] in addition to slop. Later that evening Rachel and Jeff were nominated for eviction by Kalia. The following day Jeff won the Power of Veto competition, ''Big Brother Odyssey'', by being the first HouseGuest to roll a ball back and forth with the first person to reach 300 points declared the winner. Jeff saved himself from eviction on Day 37 and Kalia nominated Lawon for eviction after he volunteered to become the nominee. Lawon was evicted on Day 41 by a unanimous vote. In an unprecedented move, he volunteered to be evicted thinking the upcoming twist would return him to the House.\n\nAfter the eviction results were announced the HouseGuests were informed of the full twist. Meanwhile, Keith, Cassi, Dominic and Brendon re-entered the House through the backyard to find out which one of the four would compete to regain HouseGuest status. Brendon was chosen to return to the House after receiving 39.5% of the public vote for a chance to return. Keith, Cassi and Dominic then exited the House. Brendon and Lawon then competed in the competition  ''That's How We Roll''. The object was to be the first person to create a complete set of fourteen multi-colored balls, each one named for one of the fourteen original HouseGuests. The player with the complete set in the fastest locked time would regain HouseGuest status. If neither player finished a complete set, the person who successfully shot the first ball would automatically win. At the start of the battle Big Brother released one hundred and fifty balls into the backyard. Brendon shot a complete set at about 2:40 and regained HouseGuest status on Day 41.\n\nLater that evening Daniele won her second Head of Household competition, ''Count on America''. Shelly and Adam were nominated for eviction the next day by Daniele. Adam won the Power of Veto competition, ''Big Brother [[Cornhole]]'', on Day 43 and saved himself from eviction on Day 46. During the competition, HouseGuests competing won a variety of prizes including, a Caribbean Vacation for Kalia, $5,000 for Jeff, a Veto ticket for Daniele ensuring her a spot in next week's Veto competition, 24-hour solitary confinement for Shelly with the privilege of receiving a phone call from home, and a \"humilitard\" to be worn by Jordan for a week. Daniele then nominated Brendon for eviction alongside Shelly. After a 5\u20131 vote in Shelly's favor, Brendon was once again evicted from the house and became the first Jury member.\n\nFollowing Brendon's eviction, the remaining eligible HouseGuests competed in the game, ''All Washed Up''. HouseGuests had to retrieve a ping-pong ball from within a container, by using a small cup to transfer Liquid Detergent across the yard while on a slippery surface. Jeff was the first to do so, and became the new Head of Household. Unbeknownst to the HouseGuests, Julie Chen announced to the viewers that Day 55 of the competition will be a Double Eviction night. Jeff nominated Porsche and Kalia for eviction. However, after he also won Power of Veto he removed Porsche from the block and replaced her with Daniele. On Day 55, Daniele was evicted on a 3\u20132 vote, becoming the second Jury member. However, the HouseGuests were informed on eviction night that it was ''Big Brother Fast Forward'', with a Head of Household competition, nomination ceremony, Veto competition and ceremony, and eviction vote all occurring on the same day. Kalia won the Head of Household competition ''Before or After'' and nominated Rachel and Jeff. Porsche won the Power of Veto in a competition called ''Clowning Around'', and chose not to use it. As a result of a tie in the eviction votes, Kalia, as HoH, voted to evict Jeff, making him the seventh evicted housemate of the season, the eighth evictee, and the third member of the Jury.\n\nFollowing Danielle and Jeff's eviction, Porsche won Week 8's HoH competition, ''Snake-Eyes'', and nominated the two remaining veterans, Jordan and Rachel, for eviction. As HoH, Porsche decided to open ''Pandora's Box (PB)'', and was awarded $10,000 that she had to split with one other player. She chose Kalia. The other part of Pandora's Box was the return of the Duo Twist for Week 8 only.  Porsche chose Kalia, Rachel chose Jordan, and Adam chose Shelly. Rachel won the ''Duo Do Over'' PoV competition, and removed Jordan and herself from the block. Porsche was left with one alternative duo \u2013 Adam & Shelly. Shelly was evicted by a 2\u20131 vote, making her the fourth member of the Jury, and the first newbie on the Jury.\n\nFollowing Shelly's eviction, The HouseGuest then competed inWeek 9's HoH competition, ''Rollin' in the Dough'', was won by Rachel. A ''Pandora's Box'' twist was offered to Rachel which led to [[Tori Spelling]] entering the house on Day 64. Kalia and Porsche were nominated for eviction. Adam won Power of Veto and let the nominations stand. As part of a second Double Eviction week, Kalia was evicted by 2\u20131 vote, with HoH Rachel casting the tie-breaking vote after Jordan voted to evict Porsche and Adam voted to evict Kalia. Kalia became the fifth Jury member, and the second newbie on the Jury. The HouseGuest then competed in the second HoH competition of the week, ''Big Brother Fortune Teller'', was won by Adam on Day 68.  He nominated Porsche and Jordan for eviction. The HouseGuests played a veto competition, ''Big Brother Jukebox'', which Porsche won. At the live veto ceremony, Porsche removed herself from the block. Rachel replaced her as the only possible alternative nominee. Immediately, Porsche cast the sole vote to evict Jordan who became the sixth member of the jury and the fourth veteran.\n\nFollowing Kalia and Jordan's eviction, Week 10's HoH competition had three parts. The final three HouseGuests began playing ''Big Brother Mixer'' to determine the winner of the first part. Adam was eliminated after 29 minutes. [[Rachel Reilly (Big Brother)|Rachel]] won when Porsche fell after 48 minutes into the competition. Porsche and Adam competed in the second part, an underwater challenge, which Porsche ultimately won. Rachel and Porsche competed in the third part of the HoH competition which Rachel won and became the Final HoH. She evicted Adam, who became the seventh and final member of the jury. By a jury vote of 4\u20133 Rachel won the $500,000 grand prize. She gained Brendon, Jeff, Jordan, and Shelly's vote while Adam, Daniele, and Kalia voted for Porsche. Porsche placed second and won the $50,000 runner-up prize. Jeff won $25,000 after being voted America's favorite player on the CBS website.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

Due to the fact that the duos were still in play, the Veto winner had a choice to remove the nominated duo from eviction. The duo of the veto winner is listed in orange. \n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: A live battle was held after the eviction and before the Head of Household competition on Day 41 to determine which evicted HouseGuest would be able to return to the House. The viewing public voted all week for Keith, Cassi, Dominic or Brendon to participate in the live battle. Brendon won the public vote and competed against Lawon, the then most recent evictee. Brendon won the battle and was reinstated as a full HouseGuest eligible to win.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: As Head of Household, Kalia was forced to break the tie on Day 55.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: Porsche opened Pandora's Box on Day 56 which reactivated the Duos twist. The remaining six were put into new duos for the week. The new duos are Adam & Shelly (A), Jordan & Rachel (B), and Kalia & Porsche (C). \n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: As Head of Household, Rachel was forced to break the tie on Day 67.\n*{{note|9|Note 9}}: During the finale, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as ''The Jury of 7'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Viewing figures===\n\"Rating\" is the estimated percentage of all televisions tuned to the show, and \"share\" is the percentage of all televisions ''in use'' that are tuned in. \"Viewers\" is the estimated number viewers that watched a program either while it was broadcast or watched via [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] on the same day the program was broadcast.

Jeff didn't think it was appropriate to have a gay headmaster locked away with children in a magical land. When fellow House Guest Kalia Booker challenged Jeff on making this statement, saying there was nothing wrong with teachers that identify as gay, Jeff rejected her viewpoint and accused her of being politically correct for the audience.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/big-brothers-jeff-schroeder-goes-210798 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Big Brother's' Jeff Schroeder Goes on Homophobic Rant About 'Harry Potter's' Dumbledore | date=July 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/big_brother_13/2011_Jul_13_jeff_homophobic_rant |title=Jeff Schroeder goes on a homophobic rant prompted by Harry Potter's Dumbledore + reality blurred |publisher=Realityblurred.com |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe conversation was posted online but was shortly removed by RealNetworks under the grounds of copyright and infringement. A couple of websites later posted full transcripts of the argument online shortly after. CBS released a public statement the following day regarding Jeff's comment, stating that any views or opinions expressed by the HouseGuests are those of the individual and not the network or producers of the program.<ref name=\"Inside TV EW.com\">{{cite news| url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/07/13/jeff-schroeder-big-brother/ |title=CBS responds to homophobic comments made in 'Big Brother' house|author= Lynette Rice |date= July 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) responded to the controversy by referring to Jeff as an \"openly anti-gay reality star\". After recounting the various programs he has taken part of (a contestant in ''[[The Amazing Race 16|''The Amazing Race'']]'', host of the second season of ''[[Around the World for Free]]'' web series and two seasons of ''Big Brother''), GLAAD alleged that the network knew Jeff would bring his \"openly anti-gay attitudes\" back to the program and questioned if the network had cast him for that purpose.<ref name=\"Inside TV EW.com\"/>\n\nAfter Jeff was evicted in a double eviction week on Day 55, Shelly Moore received heavy criticism from the show's fans, who held her responsible for his eviction. Her family later received phone calls that contained violent threats, including some aimed at her 8-year-old daughter, while her employer has also received phone calls calling for her termination. Allison Grodner, the executive producer of ''Big Brother'', posted a message on her Twitter account regarding the incidents.<ref name=ShellyThreat>{{cite web|last=TMZ Staff|title=Shelly's Family Receives Death Threats Over Jeff's Eviction|url=https://www.tmz.com/2011/08/28/big-brother-shelly-moore-death-threats-jeff-schroeder-daughter-phone-calls-kill-fbi-cbs/|work=TMZ.com|publisher=EHM Productions, Inc.|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alleged rigging from production===\nDuring week 8, a controversial Pandora's Box twist left fans wondering if production was fixing the game for certain players. As Head of Household for the week, Porsche Briggs openly identified her targets as the last two returning HouseGuests, Jordan Lloyd and Rachel Reilly. But when Porsche opened Pandora's Box, she unleashed the return of the duos twist, making both Rachel and Jordan a duo. Only one of them needed to win the Power of Veto to keep both of them safe from eviction. Fans suspected that the return of the duos twist was a ploy by production to keep both women in the game, as the remaining HouseGuests had made a contingency plan to vote out whichever veteran did not win the Power of Veto. These suspicions heightened after the Power of Veto competition was merely a redux of an earlier competition that Reilly had won. Houseguest Kalia Booker even suspected that the competition had not been properly tested, suggesting it had been thrown together at the last minute.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langston |first=Michael |url=http://www.themortonreport.com/features/is-big-brother-13-rigged/ |title=Is Big Brother 13 Rigged? |publisher=The Morton Report |date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> Rachel would go on to win the veto competition, saving herself and Jordan while forcing Porsche to nominate Adam Poch and Shelly Moore by default, as they were the only pair left for Porsche to put on the block.

Spanish was added to the curriculum following the Mexican-American War and German after World War I. [[George Veazey Strong|George Strong]] and [[Joseph Stilwell]], both West Point graduates of the class of 1904, served as [[military attache]]s to Japan and China respectively. They took the opportunity to study the local language there, and understood the need to provide language training for enlisted troops. They were among the first US commanders to establish language programs offering classes for both officers and interested enlisted soldiers, teaching rudimentary spoken Chinese and Japanese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/12/19/the-beginnings-of-the-united-states-armys-japanese-language-training-from-the-presidio-of-san-francisco-to-camp-savage-minnesota-1941-1942/|title=The Beginnings of the United States Army\u2019s Japanese Language Training|date=2017-12-19|access-date=2020-03-14|website=The National Archives and Records Administration|last=Bradsher|first=Greg}}</ref>\n\nAs relations worsened with Japan in the buildup to the war, a group of officers with previous tours of duty in Japan including [[Rufus S. Bratton]] and [[Sidney Mashbir]] understood the complexity of the Japanese language and recognized the need for an intelligence unit able to comprehend not only the spoken Japanese language but the intricacies of [[military terminology]]. US Army [[G-2 (intelligence)|G-2 intelligence]] staff first surveyed colleges for Japanese language students and came to the realization that in all of America, only 60 military aged Caucasian males had any interest in Japan, mostly for purely academic reasons. The possibility of using [[Japanese Americans]], or Nisei, with language skills was suggested as the number of Caucasian personnel qualified in Japanese was almost non-existent, and there was little time to train additional Caucasian personnel. The Army directed the [[Fourth United States Army|Fourth Army]], responsible for the defense of the West Coast, to start a school, assigning Lt Col John Weckerling and Capt. Kai E. Rasmussen, graduates of the Japanese language program in [[Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Tokyo#Previous_US_missions_in_Japan|Tokyo]] to stand up the school. Nisei soldiers [[John F.

John Aiso had been drafted in 1940 and assigned to a motor pool even though at the time, he was already a well respected [[Harvard Law School]] educated attorney working with a [[white-shoe firm]] firm in international law. \n\nFollowing Pearl Harbor, most of the Nisei were summarily discharged or placed under constant surveillance. For the officers in charge of the school and their Nisei students, the outbreak of war prompted their studies to intensify to prove their loyalty. Military Security officers questioned the loyalty of the Nisei students, removing some due to suspicion, and prompting Weckerling and Rasmussen to recognize that frontline commanders would have difficulty entrusting the Nisei soldiers with sensitive documents, and sought to find Caucasian officers with Japanese proficiency to serve as team leaders. Eighteen National Guard and Reserve officers drifted through the class, most failing due to limited comprehension ability and the complexity of the Japanese [[Kanji|written language]]. Two men, however, graduated with the first group, Captain David Swift and Captain John Burden, both born in Japan as the sons of missionaries, and even spoke the Tokyo dialect better than some of the Nisei students.<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/>\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment pushed President Roosevelt to issue [[Executive Order 9066]], forcing the removal of anyone with as little as 1/16th Japanese ancestry from [[West Coast of the United States]]. By March 1942, the [[Military Intelligence Division]] was being reorganized as the Military Intelligence Service (MIS). It was tasked with collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence, and absorbed the Fourth Army Intelligence School. Originally comprising just 26 people, 16 of them officers, it was quickly expanded to include 342 officers and 1,000 enlisted men and civilians. Minnesota's Governor [[Harold Stassen]] offered up [[Camp Savage]], a former Works Progress Administration facility to host the MIS Language School. The school moved to Minnesota in June 1942, offering larger facilities without the complications of training Japanese-American students in the coastal areas they were prohibited from, and faced less anti-Japanese prejudice.<ref name=DLIFLC75/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/secret-world-war-ii-military-language-school-at-fort-snelling-getting-recognition/303181451/|title=Secret military language school at Fort Snelling getting recognition|date=2015-05-10|access-date=2020-03-14|website=Star Tribune|last=Brown|first=Curt}}</ref>\n\n===MIS Graduates Put To The Test===\n[[File:MIS_New_Guinea_1943.jpg|thumb|right|MIS interogators Phil Ishio and Arthur Ushiro question a prisoner taken in the Buna campaign.]]\nAs the first MISLS class completed its training in May 1942, its students were immediately sent to the frontlines, participating in [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal]] to interrogate the first captured Japanese pilot.<ref name=MIS_Timeline>{{Cite web|url=https://www.njahs.org/misnorcal/timeline/timeline.htm|title=MIS Timeline|access-date=2020-02-29|website=MIS Association of Northern California|publisher=National Japanese American Historical Society}}</ref> At first, commanders were skeptical of the Nisei linguists. The first unit of MIS deployed under the command of Capt John Burden with the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] to the [[Solomon Islands campaign]]. Upon arrival, Burden and his Nisei predictably found themselves assigned to menial tasks translating non-sensitive personal letters far from the front due to the lack of trust. After a chance meeting with [[William Halsey Jr.|Admiral Halsey]], Halsey confessed to Burden that his own Caucasian interpreters only had a rudimentary understanding of Japanese and could only decipher the names of the prisoners. Burden convinced Halsey to give him a chance. Burden demonstrated the wealth of information that could be provided by a fully fluent linguist and vouched for the Nisei soldiers in his command to meet the demand. His presence proved to be instrumental in opening the eyes of the American field commanders to the value of the Nisei linguists.<ref name=DLIFLC75/><ref name=Capt_Burden>{{Cite web|url=http://www.javadc.org/burden.htm|title=Col J.

MIS soldier Harold Fudenna intercepted a radio message indicating the whereabouts of Admiral Yamamoto, which led to [[P-38 Lightning]] fighter planes shooting down his plane over the [[Solomon Islands]]. Although this message was first met with disbelief that the Japanese would be so careless, other MIS linguists in Alaska and Hawaii had also intercepted the same message, confirming its accuracy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Solomons Campaign |url=http://www.goforbroke.org/history/history_historical_campaigns_mis_northern.asp |website=www.goforbroke.org |publisher=Go For Broke National Education Center |archivedate=March 5, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130259/http://www.goforbroke.org/history/history_historical_campaigns_mis_northern.asp}}</ref> The success of these first few Nisei linguists convinced the War Department to establish more Japanese-American combat units such as the famed [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]] deployed to the European Theater.<ref name=DLIFLC75/> \n\n===Merrill's Marauders===\n[[File:Gen_Frank_Merrill_with_MIS_Interpreters.jpg|thumbnail|Brig Gen Frank Merrill, commander of \"Merrill's Marauders,\" poses with Herbert Miyasaki and Akiji Yoshimura.]]\nWhen [[Merrill's Marauders]] were organized to conduct [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] deep behind Japanese lines in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]] in January 1944, fourteen MIS linguists were assigned to the unit, including future [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] and [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Roy Matsumoto]].<ref name=MIS_Timeline/>\n\nThe Nisei under Merrill's command proved themselves particularly intrepid and helpful, venturing into the enemy lines and translating audible commands to counter attacks, and shouting conflicting commands to the Japanese, throwing them into confusion. They soon became the best known Nisei in the war against Japan. The [[War Relocation Authority]] used their story to impress other Americans with Nisei valor and loyalty, even placing stories in local newspapers as the war waned in 1945, and the WRA prepared to release Japanese-American citizens back into their communities.<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/>   \n\n===Continued Success===\nNisei MIS linguists translated Japanese documents known as the \"[[Z Plan (Japan)|Z Plan]]\" in March\u2013June 1944, which contained Japan's counterattack strategy in the [[Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific]].

MIS linguists were also assigned to the [[United_States_Office_of_War_Information#Pacific_Theater|Office of War Information]] to help create propaganda and other [[psychological warfare]] campaigns, with the [[Signal Intelligence Service]] to decipher Japanese [[Japanese army and diplomatic codes|Army codes]], and even involved with the [[Manhattan Project]], translating technical documents and scientific papers on nuclear physics.

The role and activities of the MIS was kept in secrecy for more than 30 years; the few records about its activities were finally made available to the public in 1972 under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], however much still remains unknown today. Consequently, many MIS soldiers did not receive recognition or decorations for their efforts. They became \"unsung heroes\", unacknowledged for their contributions in wartime as well as postwar activities.

Spanish was added to the curriculum following the Mexican-American War and German after World War I. [[George Veazey Strong|George Strong]] and [[Joseph Stilwell]], both West Point graduates of the class of 1904, served as [[military attache]]s to Japan and China respectively. They took the opportunity to study the local language there, and understood the need to provide language training for enlisted troops. They were among the first US commanders to establish language programs offering classes for both officers and interested enlisted soldiers, teaching rudimentary spoken Chinese and Japanese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2017/12/19/the-beginnings-of-the-united-states-armys-japanese-language-training-from-the-presidio-of-san-francisco-to-camp-savage-minnesota-1941-1942/|title=The Beginnings of the United States Army\u2019s Japanese Language Training|date=2017-12-19|access-date=2020-03-14|website=The National Archives and Records Administration|last=Bradsher|first=Greg}}</ref>\n\nAs relations worsened with Japan in the buildup to the war, a group of officers with previous tours of duty in Japan including [[Rufus S. Bratton]] and [[Sidney Mashbir]] understood the complexity of the Japanese language and recognized the need for an intelligence unit able to comprehend not only the spoken Japanese language but the intricacies of [[military terminology]]. US Army [[G-2 (intelligence)|G-2 intelligence]] staff first surveyed colleges for Japanese language students and came to the realization that in all of America, only 60 military aged Caucasian males had any interest in Japan, mostly for purely academic reasons. The possibility of using [[Japanese Americans]], or Nisei, with language skills was suggested as the number of Caucasian personnel qualified in Japanese was almost non-existent, and there was little time to train additional Caucasian personnel. The Army directed the [[Fourth United States Army|Fourth Army]], responsible for the defense of the West Coast, to start a school, assigning Lt Col John Weckerling and Capt. Kai E. Rasmussen, graduates of the Japanese language program in [[Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Tokyo#Previous_US_missions_in_Japan|Tokyo]] to stand up the school. Nisei soldiers [[John F. Aiso]] and Arthur Kaneko were found to be qualified linguists and recruited along with two civilian instructors, Akira Oshida and Shigeya Kihara, and became the Military Intelligence Service Language School (MISLS)'s first instructors.<ref name=DLIFLC75>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dliflc.edu/75th-anniversary-special-the-nisei-legacy/?highlight=john%20aiso|title=75th Anniversary Special: The Nisei legacy|date=2016-07-27|access-date=2020-02-29|website=Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center|last=Bray|first=Patrick}}</ref>  \n\n===The Military Intelligence Service Language School===\n[[File:MIS Language School.jpg|thumb|The inaugural MISLS class at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1942.]]\nThe MISLS (initially known as the Fourth Army Intelligence School) began operation with an initial budget of $2,000 and scrounged together textbooks and supplies in November 1941, about a month before the Japanese bombed [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].

John Aiso had been drafted in 1940 and assigned to a motor pool even though at the time, he was already a well respected [[Harvard Law School]] educated attorney working with a [[white-shoe firm]] firm in international law. \n\nFollowing Pearl Harbor, most of the Nisei were summarily discharged or placed under constant surveillance. For the officers in charge of the school and their Nisei students, the outbreak of war prompted their studies to intensify to prove their loyalty. Military Security officers questioned the loyalty of the Nisei students, removing some due to suspicion, and prompting Weckerling and Rasmussen to recognize that frontline commanders would have difficulty entrusting the Nisei soldiers with sensitive documents, and sought to find Caucasian officers with Japanese proficiency to serve as team leaders. Eighteen National Guard and Reserve officers drifted through the class, most failing due to limited comprehension ability and the complexity of the Japanese [[Kanji|written language]]. Two men, however, graduated with the first group, Captain David Swift and Captain John Burden, both born in Japan as the sons of missionaries, and even spoke the Tokyo dialect better than some of the Nisei students.<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/>\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment pushed President Roosevelt to issue [[Executive Order 9066]], forcing the removal of anyone with as little as 1/16th Japanese ancestry from [[West Coast of the United States]]. By March 1942, the [[Military Intelligence Division]] was being reorganized as the Military Intelligence Service (MIS). It was tasked with collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence, and absorbed the Fourth Army Intelligence School. Originally comprising just 26 people, 16 of them officers, it was quickly expanded to include 342 officers and 1,000 enlisted men and civilians. Minnesota's Governor [[Harold Stassen]] offered up [[Camp Savage]], a former Works Progress Administration facility to host the MIS Language School. The school moved to Minnesota in June 1942, offering larger facilities without the complications of training Japanese-American students in the coastal areas they were prohibited from, and faced less anti-Japanese prejudice.<ref name=DLIFLC75/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/secret-world-war-ii-military-language-school-at-fort-snelling-getting-recognition/303181451/|title=Secret military language school at Fort Snelling getting recognition|date=2015-05-10|access-date=2020-03-14|website=Star Tribune|last=Brown|first=Curt}}</ref>\n\n===MIS Graduates Put To The Test===\n[[File:MIS_New_Guinea_1943.jpg|thumb|right|MIS interogators Phil Ishio and Arthur Ushiro question a prisoner taken in the Buna campaign.]]\nAs the first MISLS class completed its training in May 1942, its students were immediately sent to the frontlines, participating in [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal]] to interrogate the first captured Japanese pilot.<ref name=MIS_Timeline>{{Cite web|url=https://www.njahs.org/misnorcal/timeline/timeline.htm|title=MIS Timeline|access-date=2020-02-29|website=MIS Association of Northern California|publisher=National Japanese American Historical Society}}</ref> At first, commanders were skeptical of the Nisei linguists. The first unit of MIS deployed under the command of Capt John Burden with the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] to the [[Solomon Islands campaign]]. Upon arrival, Burden and his Nisei predictably found themselves assigned to menial tasks translating non-sensitive personal letters far from the front due to the lack of trust. After a chance meeting with [[William Halsey Jr.|Admiral Halsey]], Halsey confessed to Burden that his own Caucasian interpreters only had a rudimentary understanding of Japanese and could only decipher the names of the prisoners. Burden convinced Halsey to give him a chance. Burden demonstrated the wealth of information that could be provided by a fully fluent linguist and vouched for the Nisei soldiers in his command to meet the demand. His presence proved to be instrumental in opening the eyes of the American field commanders to the value of the Nisei linguists.<ref name=DLIFLC75/><ref name=Capt_Burden>{{Cite web|url=http://www.javadc.org/burden.htm|title=Col J. Alfred Burden|access-date=2020-02-29|website=Japanese American Veterans Association|last=Tsukiyama|first=Ted}}</ref>\n\nMIS servicemen would then be present at every major battle against Japanese forces following [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], and those who served in combat faced extremely dangerous and difficult conditions, facing prejudice from soldiers who believed they couldn't be trusted, sometimes coming under [[friendly fire]] from U.S. soldiers unable to distinguish them from the Japanese, and even dealing with the psychological conflict of encountering former friends and family on the battlefield.<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/> \n\nA major MIS contribution in the [[Operation Vengeance|Solomons campaign]] was the ambush of [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] in April 1943. MIS soldier Harold Fudenna intercepted a radio message indicating the whereabouts of Admiral Yamamoto, which led to [[P-38 Lightning]] fighter planes shooting down his plane over the [[Solomon Islands]]. Although this message was first met with disbelief that the Japanese would be so careless, other MIS linguists in Alaska and Hawaii had also intercepted the same message, confirming its accuracy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Solomons Campaign |url=http://www.goforbroke.org/history/history_historical_campaigns_mis_northern.asp |website=www.goforbroke.org |publisher=Go For Broke National Education Center |archivedate=March 5, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130259/http://www.goforbroke.org/history/history_historical_campaigns_mis_northern.asp}}</ref> The success of these first few Nisei linguists convinced the War Department to establish more Japanese-American combat units such as the famed [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]] deployed to the European Theater.<ref name=DLIFLC75/> \n\n===Merrill's Marauders===\n[[File:Gen_Frank_Merrill_with_MIS_Interpreters.jpg|thumbnail|Brig Gen Frank Merrill, commander of \"Merrill's Marauders,\" poses with Herbert Miyasaki and Akiji Yoshimura.]]\nWhen [[Merrill's Marauders]] were organized to conduct [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] deep behind Japanese lines in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]] in January 1944, fourteen MIS linguists were assigned to the unit, including future [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] and [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Roy Matsumoto]].<ref name=MIS_Timeline/>\n\nThe Nisei under Merrill's command proved themselves particularly intrepid and helpful, venturing into the enemy lines and translating audible commands to counter attacks, and shouting conflicting commands to the Japanese, throwing them into confusion. They soon became the best known Nisei in the war against Japan. The [[War Relocation Authority]] used their story to impress other Americans with Nisei valor and loyalty, even placing stories in local newspapers as the war waned in 1945, and the WRA prepared to release Japanese-American citizens back into their communities.<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/>   \n\n===Continued Success===\nNisei MIS linguists translated Japanese documents known as the \"[[Z Plan (Japan)|Z Plan]]\" in March\u2013June 1944, which contained Japan's counterattack strategy in the [[Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific]]. This information led to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], in which the Japanese lost most of their [[aircraft carrier]] planes, and the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/fall/z-plan-2.html|title=The \"Z Plan\" Story: Japan's 1944 Naval Battle Strategy Drifts into U.S. Hands|publisher = Time Magazine|year=2005|author=Greg Bradsher|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the language school outgrew Camp Savage and moved to [[Fort Snelling]], [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Minnesota]].<ref name=Nakamura-MIS>Nakamura, Kelli Y. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Military_Intelligence_Service_Language_School/ \"Military Intelligence Service Language School,\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 17 July 2014.</ref> Many of the MIS Language School graduates during this time were attached to the joint Australian/American [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section]] (ATIS) as linguists and in other non-combatant roles, interpreting captured enemy documents and interrogating [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. MIS linguists were also assigned to the [[United_States_Office_of_War_Information#Pacific_Theater|Office of War Information]] to help create propaganda and other [[psychological warfare]] campaigns, with the [[Signal Intelligence Service]] to decipher Japanese [[Japanese army and diplomatic codes|Army codes]], and even involved with the [[Manhattan Project]], translating technical documents and scientific papers on nuclear physics. (At the end of the war, MIS linguists had translated 20.5 million pages, 18,000 enemy documents, created 16,000 propaganda leaflets and interrogated over 10,000 Japanese POWs.)<ref name=Nisei_Linguists/> \n\nBecause of the highly classified and secret nature of these missions, knowledge of the work of many MIS soldiers was largely missing during the war and even decades afterwards. The role and activities of the MIS was kept in secrecy for more than 30 years; the few records about its activities were finally made available to the public in 1972 under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], however much still remains unknown today. Consequently, many MIS soldiers did not receive recognition or decorations for their efforts. They became \"unsung heroes\", unacknowledged for their contributions in wartime as well as postwar activities. ATIS commander Col [[Sidney Mashbir]] would write in his memoir, \"I Was an American Spy\", ''\"The United States of America owes a debt to these men and to their families which it can never fully repay.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.huachuca.army.mil/sites/History/PDFS/MMASHBIR.PDF |title = Sidney F.

The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though [[injection molding]] is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including [[high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polystyrene|PS]], and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. Polyethylene-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorants]], [[coupling agent]]s, [[UV stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.\n\nIn some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktron.com/industries_served/plastics/woodplastic.cfm|title=Wood-Plastic Composites production requires high formulation quality the feeding system|work=ktron.com}}</ref>\n\nDue to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (28&nbsp;\u00b0C) lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around 400&nbsp;\u00b0F (204&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.greendotbioplastics.com/materials/wood-composites/|title = Wood-Plastic Composites \u2013 Green Dot Bioplastics|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that\u2019s too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.\n\n[[File:Wood plastic composite 2.jpg|right|thumb|Wood-plastic composite is a type of [[engineered wood]].]]\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]\nWPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and [[Gribble|marine borer]] attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material.<ref>Stark, N.

WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using [[recycled plastic]]s and the waste products of the [[wood industry]]. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use.<ref>Gibson, Scott (2008). \u201cSynthetic Decking\u201d [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/remodeling/synthetic-decking.aspx]. Remodeling Magazine.</ref> They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves.

The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though [[injection molding]] is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including [[high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polystyrene|PS]], and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. Polyethylene-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorants]], [[coupling agent]]s, [[UV stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.\n\nIn some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktron.com/industries_served/plastics/woodplastic.cfm|title=Wood-Plastic Composites production requires high formulation quality the feeding system|work=ktron.com}}</ref>\n\nDue to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (28&nbsp;\u00b0C) lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around 400&nbsp;\u00b0F (204&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.greendotbioplastics.com/materials/wood-composites/|title = Wood-Plastic Composites \u2013 Green Dot Bioplastics|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that\u2019s too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.\n\n[[File:Wood plastic composite 2.jpg|right|thumb|Wood-plastic composite is a type of [[engineered wood]].]]\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]\nWPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and [[Gribble|marine borer]] attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material.<ref>Stark, N.

WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using [[recycled plastic]]s and the waste products of the [[wood industry]]. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use.<ref>Gibson, Scott (2008). \u201cSynthetic Decking\u201d [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/remodeling/synthetic-decking.aspx]. Remodeling Magazine.</ref> They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves.

The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests entered the house, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (American season)|Big Brother 9]]''.

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status.

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

After a HouseGuest became Head of Household, he or she was ineligible to take part in the next Head of Household competition.

It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.\n\nIn a change from past seasons, four former HouseGuests from past seasons of ''Big Brother'' returned to coach the new HouseGuests during their time in the House. Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests entered the house, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (American season)|Big Brother 9]]''.

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status. A 3\u20131 vote brought the coaches into the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Age on entry\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Occupation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Residence\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Big Brother'' History\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Big Brother 14'' results\n|-\n!

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!
