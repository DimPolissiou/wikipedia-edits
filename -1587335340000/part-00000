The script was adapted from the novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], about the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] codebreakers of [[Bletchley Park]] in the [[Second World War]].\n\nAlthough the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the [[Katyn massacre]] is highlighted. It was the last film scored by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|\"Shark\" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.\n\nThe film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier.

The script was adapted from the novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], about the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] codebreakers of [[Bletchley Park]] in the [[Second World War]].\n\nAlthough the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the [[Katyn massacre]] is highlighted. It was the last film scored by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|\"Shark\" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.\n\nThe film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.\n\nMr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an [[MI5]] agent, Wigram ([[Jeremy Northam]]), who plays [[cat and mouse]] with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.\n\nBut someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Tom Jericho\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Hester Wallace\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Claire Romilly\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Mr Wigram\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jozef 'Puck' Pukowski\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Guy Logie\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Leveret\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Cave\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Skynner\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Admiral Trowbridge\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as Villiers\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as Heaviside\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production and premiere==\n[[File:BletcleyPark SubModel.JPG|thumb|The scaled-down model of a Second World War U-boat used in the film.

It had a limited release on 26 April 2013 in [[Canada]], and was released on 20 September 2013 in the [[United States]].\n\n==Plot==\nBy 2045, humans have built weather machines to control the warming climate due to [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. The machines break down when one day it begins to snow and doesn't stop. Whatever humans remain, live in [[underground bunker]]s to escape the extreme cold. Their challenges are controlling disease and producing sufficient food. Two soldiers, Briggs ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) and Mason ([[Bill Paxton]]) are the leaders of one such bunker, Colony 7. Briggs, Sam ([[Kevin Zegers]]) and Graydon ([[Atticus Dean Mitchell]]) travel to nearby Colony 5 after receiving a distress signal. Briggs leaves Sam's lover Kai ([[Charlotte Sullivan]]) in charge of the colony while he's gone, much to Mason's chagrin.\n\nUpon arrival, they find Colony 5 covered in blood. They eventually reach a locked door which Sam picks open. Inside they find Leland, who shows them a message they received from another group of people who fixed a weather machine and have caused the snow to thaw. The group offers aid to anyone and asks that they bring seeds so they can be planted in the newly thawed permafrost soil. Leland shows them where the signal came from, but informs them that an expedition failed to find the source of the transmission. Moreover, the expedition's tracks led a marauding group of [[Cannibalism|cannibals]] back to Colony 5, and the killing ensued. Briggs, Sam, and Graydon try to force Leland to return with them, but he locks himself back into his room.\n\nThe three then begin to explore Colony 5 and approach a room where a fire burns.  Here they see a human chopping up members of Colony 5, while others feast on human remains. As the three try to escape, Graydon is killed by the cannibals. Briggs and Sam are able to make it up the ladder out of the colony and destroy the shaft with a stick of dynamite. Taking shelter in an abandoned helicopter, they wake up in the morning to find that the cannibals have managed to escape from the entombed Colony 5 and have tracked their footprints in the snow. Briggs suggests that they lure the group over a decrepit bridge then use dynamite. When the dynamite fuse goes out, Briggs rushes back to light it, but is attacked by the cannibals. He relights the fuse and sacrifices himself to blow a large gap in the bridge.\n\nKai gets into a heated argument with Mason after learning that he intends to kill a colonist without testing her for disease. Their argument is interrupted when Kai spots a returning, exhausted Sam and runs to him, but Mason promptly knocks her out. When Sam awakens, he finds Mason has taken over and plans to make harsh changes. Sam explains that the cannibals are coming and that there is a thawed-out area they should flee to. Mason does not believe him, thinking he has become unhinged by his ordeal, and handcuffs him to a bed. Sam is able to get free and checks images from a functioning [[satellite]] to locate the thawed-out zone. Then the cannibals arrive. Many of the Colony 7 inhabitants are killed, including Sam's friend Viktor (John Tench). The survivors lock themselves in a room. Sam and Kai bang on the door, but Mason will not let them in. Briggs' daughter Nara ([[Lisa Berry]]) knocks Mason down and lets them in. Sam opens a vent for an escape route. The wounded Mason stays behind and, when the cannibals break in, shoots a gas container, causing an explosion that kills presumably all but the leader. The cannibals' leader pursues and attacks Sam, but Sam is able to kill him. Then he, Kai, Nara and a few others begin their journey to the thawed-out site with the precious seeds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Briggs\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Sam\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Mason\n* [[Charlotte Sullivan]] as Kai\n* John Tench as Viktor\n* [[Lisa Berry]] as Nara\n* [[Atticus Mitchell]] as Graydon\n* Dru Viergever as Feral Leader\n* Romano Orzari as Reynolds\n* [[Michael Mando]] as Cooper\n* [[Earl Pastko]] as the Scientist\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Leyland\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot at [[CFB North Bay]] using former NORAD facilities<ref name=GM>{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/the-colony-the-best-thing-is-the-gloomy-set/article11546417/ | title=The Colony: The best thing is this sci-fi horror's gloomy set | first=Liam | last=Lacey | newspaper=The Globe and Mail | date=26 April 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2013 }} {{rating|1|4}}</ref> and at the [[Hearn Generating Station|R.
