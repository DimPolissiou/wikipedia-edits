Spawned by earlier band [[The Id (band)|The Id]], the outfit is composed of co-founders [[Andy McCluskey]] (vocals, bass guitar) and [[Paul Humphreys]] (keyboards, vocals), along with [[Martin Cooper (musician)|Martin Cooper]] (various instruments) and [[Stuart Kershaw]] (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \"[[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Electricity]]\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 [[List of anti-war songs|anti-war song]] \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\". The band achieved broader recognition via their album ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' (1981) and its three singles, all of which were international hits.\n\nAlthough retrospectively acclaimed, the experimental ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' (1983) eroded European support. The band embraced a more straightforward pop sound on ''[[Junk Culture]]'' (1984), while continuing to experiment via newly acquired digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]; this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and yielded the 1986 hit, \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\". A year after the release of ''[[The Best of OMD]]'' (1988), creative differences rendered McCluskey the only remaining member of the group as Humphreys formed spin-off band [[The Listening Pool]]. OMD would return with a new line-up and explore the [[dance-pop]] genre: ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits. By the mid-1990s, however, electronic music had been supplanted by [[alternative rock]], and both OMD and The Listening Pool disbanded in 1996. McCluskey later conceived pop [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]], for whom he served as a principal songwriter, while Humphreys performed as half of the duo [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]].\n\nIn 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys back in the fold and began to work on material more akin to their early output. The band re-established themselves as a chart act, and kept on touring extensively. They have sold over 40 million records to date.\n\n==Roots and early years (1975\u20131978)==\nFounders [[Andy McCluskey]] and [[Paul Humphreys]] met at primary school in [[Meols]] in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved in different local groups but shared a distaste for [[Cock rock|guitar-driven rock with a macho attitude]] popular among their friends at the time.<ref>Taylor, Paul.

The pair shared a love of [[electronic music]], particularly [[Brian Eno]] and Kraftwerk.\n\nIn September 1977,<ref name=\"familytree\">Pete Frame's Rock Family Tree</ref> McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group [[The Id]], whose line-up included drummer [[Malcolm Holmes]] and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the [[Merseyside]] area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\"Julia's Song\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called ''Street to Street.'' Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side-project called VCL XI (named after a misreading of a valve from the diagram on the back cover of [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' album; the name of valve is actually written with Arabic numbers, VCL 11, and not [[Roman numerals]]). This side-project allowed them to pursue their more bizarre electronic experiments, often working with tape collages, home-made kit-built synthesisers, and [[Circuit bending|circuit-bent]] radios.\n\nIn August 1978, The Id split due to musical differences. The same month, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit [[Dalek I Love You]] as their lead singer, but quit in September.<ref name=\"familytree\"/>\n\n==Formation and first releases (1978\u20131979)==\nIn September 1978, the same month he left Dalek I Love You, McCluskey rejoined Humphreys and their VCL XI project was renamed Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The name was gleaned from a list of song lyrics and ideas that were written on McCluskey's bedroom wall;<ref name=Lindgren/> the name was chosen so as not to be mistaken for a [[punk music|punk]] band.<ref>''Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed'', Dave Wilson, 2004, p. 58</ref> OMD began to gig regularly as a duo, performing to backing tracks played from a [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 4-track tape-recorder christened \"Winston\" (after the antihero of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'').

The track was supposed to be produced by the Factory Records producer [[Martin Hannett]]. However, the A-side was the band's original demo produced by their friend, owner of Winston and soon to be manager, Paul Collister under the pseudonym Chester Valentino (taken from a nightclub called Valentino's in the nearby city of [[Chester]]). The single's sleeve was designed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]], whose distinctive graphics provided OMD's public image well into the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1979 they were asked to support [[Gary Numan]] on his first major British tour. Humphreys noted, \"[Numan] gave us our first big break. He saw us opening for [[Joy Division]] and he asked us to go on tour with him... we went from the small clubs to playing huge arenas.

It had a raw, poppy, melodic synth-pop sound. Dindisc arranged for the song \"[[Messages (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Messages]]\" to be re-recorded (produced by [[gong (band)|Gong]] bassist [[Mike Howlett]]) and released as a single \u2013 it gave the band their first hit. [[David Hughes (musician)|Dave Hughes]], a founder member of Dalek I Love You who joined OMD in early 1980, is featured in the \"Messages\" video.\n\nA tour followed, Winston the tape recorder was augmented with live drums from [[Malcolm Holmes]], and [[Dalek I Love You]]'s Dave Hughes on synths. Hughes then left OMD in November 1980, replaced by Martin Cooper.\n\nThe second album ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]'' (a reference to the band which preceded Kraftwerk, founded by Kraftwerk's original members Florian Schneider-Esleben and Ralf H\u00fctter) followed later that year, recorded as a three-piece with Humphreys, McCluskey and Holmes. It was again produced by Howlett, and had a rather moodier, dark feel. The album spawned the hit single \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\", named after [[Enola Gay|the plane that dropped an atomic bomb]] on Hiroshima. The song was intended to be included on the debut album, but was left out at the final selection. The tour for this album had a 4-piece band line-up, with saxophonist Martin Cooper (another [[Dalek I Love You]] alumnus) recruited for keyboard duties. In early 1981, ''[[Record Mirror]]'' named OMD as the fourth-best band of 1980; ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' both named the group as one of the 10 best new acts of that year.<ref>West, p. 26</ref>\n\nHowlett then presided over the recording of a further hit single, \"[[Souvenir (song)|Souvenir]]\", co-written by Cooper & Humphreys. It ushered in a lush choral electronic sound. The song also became OMD's biggest UK hit to date. In November 1981, their most commercially successful album was released in the UK and Europe \u2013 ''[[Architecture & Morality]]''. The group went into the studio with Richard Mainwaring producing. Cooper then temporarily dropped out and was replaced by Mike Douglas, but this change was reversed by the time the album was released and a tour followed. The album's sound saw OMD's original synth-pop sound augmented by the [[Mellotron]], an instrument previously associated with [[prog rock]] bands. They used it to add very atmospheric swatches of string, choir, and other sounds to their palette. Two more hit singles \"Joan of Arc\" and \"[[Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)|Maid of Orleans]]\" (which became the biggest-selling single of 1982 in Germany<ref name=\"stanley\"/>) were on the album. \"Joan of Arc\" and \"Maid of Orleans\" were originally both titled \"Joan of Arc\"; the name of the latter single was changed at the insistence of the publishers and to avoid confusion. It became \"Joan of Arc (Maid of Orleans)\" and later simply \"Maid of Orleans\".\n\nIn 1983 the band lost commercial momentum somewhat, with the release of their more experimental ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' album, which mixed melancholy synth ballads and uptempo synth-pop with [[musique concr\u00e8te]] and short wave radio tape collages. It was recorded by the 4-piece Humphreys/Holmes/Cooper/McCluskey line-up, and produced by Rhett Davies. Its relative commercial failure caused a crisis of confidence for Humphreys and McCluskey and brought about a deliberate move towards the mainstream.<ref name=\"stanley\"/>\n\n===Pop-oriented recordings (1984\u20131988)===\n1984's ''[[Junk Culture]]'' was a shift to a more pop-style sound and the band used digital sampling keyboards such as the [[Fairlight CMI]] and the E-mu Emulator. The album was a success, reassuring the group about their new direction. The \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" single returned the group to the top five in the UK and was a good indicator of the group's new found sound, notably the adoption of a classic [[verse\u2013chorus form]], which is something the group had often previously avoided. In 1985, the band expanded to a sextet, featuring new band members Graham Weir (guitar, keyboards, trombone) and Neil Weir (trumpet, bass guitar), and released ''[[Crush (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Crush]]'', produced by [[Stephen Hague]] in Paris and New York. The success of the single \"[[So in Love (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|So in Love]]\" in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] also led to some success for the [[LP album|LP]] which entered the [[American Top 40]], establishing the group in the US and making Stephen Hague a sought-after producer. During this period, the band also recorded a special version of \"So in Love\" in duet with the French pop singer [[Etienne Daho]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eclipstv.fr/videos/omd-etienne-daho-so-in-love-les-enfants-du-rock-1986-2159|title=OMD & Etienne Daho - So in love (Les Enfants du Rock 1986)|website=Eclipstv.fr}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1985 the band was asked to write a song for the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. They selected \"Goddess of Love\". The ending of the film was re shot. After the song received a negative reaction from test groups, OMD wrote \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\" in less than 24 hours<ref name=Lindgren/> and it became a top 5 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand in 1986. At the end of this year, the same six piece line-up also released ''[[The Pacific Age]]'', but the band began to see their critical and public popularity wane notably in the UK. The album's first single, \"[[(Forever) Live and Die]]\", was a top 10 hit across Europe<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/OMD-(Orchestral-Manoeuvres-In-The-Dark)/(Forever)-Live-And-Die-1517|title=OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark) - (Forever) Live And Die|website=Hitparade.ch}}</ref> and entered the top 20 in both the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/(forever)-live-and-die/|title=(forever) live and die &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> and US. Journalist [[Hugo Lindgren]] argued that the success of \"If You Leave\" has concealed from US audiences the group's history of making innovative music.<ref name=Lindgren/>\n\n==Split and McCluskey-led OMD (1989\u20131996)==\nDuring 1988 the band appeared poised to consolidate their US success, with a support slot for [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Music for the Masses Tour]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California on 18 June 1988, a top 20 US hit with \"Dreaming\" and a successful \"Best of\" album. However, it was at this point when OMD broke in two. Graham and Neil Weir left at the end of the 1988 US tour and co-founder Paul Humphreys subsequently called it a day, unhappy with the band's commercial orientation. Finally, Cooper and Holmes left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called [[the Listening Pool]] in 1989.\n\nIt left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the [[dance-pop]] ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' album in May 1991, which charted at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, [[Stuart Kershaw]], Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of ''Sugar Tax'': writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like \"[[Sailing on the Seven Seas]]\" and \"[[Pandora's Box (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Pandora's Box]]\", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, \"[[Call My Name (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Call My Name]]\" and \"[[Then You Turn Away]]\". McCluskey's live band was then formed by [[Nigel Ipinson]] (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) since late 1990. Kershaw, Ipinson, and Coxon from 1992 to 1996 contributed to OMD albums and a 1993 tour.\n\nThe album ''[[Liberator (album)|Liberator]]'' was released in 1993. It peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Lead single \"[[Stand Above Me]]\" peaked at no. 21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], with follow-up \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\" charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \"[[Everyday (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Everyday]]\" (a No. 59 UK chart entry).\n\nThe fifth track from Liberator, \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\", was built around a sample from \"[[Love's Theme]]\" by [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a track which was written and produced by [[Barry White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/Discography-Liberator.html |title=Liberator |website=Omd.uk.com |accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> To release the \"Dream of Me\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \"Love's Theme\" sample, but still be officially titled \"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White.\n\nAlso in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the ''[[Esperanto (Elektric Music album)|Esperanto]]'' album, a project by former [[Kraftwerk]] member [[Karl Bartos]] (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music).\n\nMcCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the 1996 album ''[[Universal (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Universal]]'', which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the ''Esperanto'' sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \"[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]\".\n\n==Disbandment (1996)==\nThough both ''Liberator'' and ''Universal'' produced minor hits, McCluskey retired the OMD name in late 1996, due to waning public interest. A second [[The OMD Singles|singles album]] was released in 1998, along with an [[Extended play|EP]] of remixed material by such acts as [[Sash!]] and [[Moby]].\n\nPost-1996, McCluskey decided to focus on songwriting for such Liverpool based acts as [[Atomic Kitten]] and the Genie Queen, and trying to develop new Merseyside artists from his Motor Museum recording studio. With McCluskey focusing his talents elsewhere, Humphreys decided to work with his new musical partner [[Claudia Br\u00fccken]], of the [[ZTT]] bands [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] and [[Act (band)|Act]], as [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]]. He also undertook a US live tour under the banner Paul Humphreys from OMD.\n\n==Reformation (2006\u2013present)==\nAn unexpected request to perform from a German Television show and McCluskey's divorce led the group to reform.<ref name=Lindgren/> On 1 January 2006, Andy McCluskey announced plans to reform OMD with the McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes, and Cooper line-up. The original plan was to tour the album ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' and other pre-1983 material, then record a new album set for release in 2007.\n\nIn May 2007, the ''Architecture & Morality'' remastered CD was re-released together with a DVD featuring the Drury Lane concert from 1981 that had previously been available on VHS. Through May and June, the band toured with the \"classic\" line up of McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes and Cooper. They began their set with a re-ordered but otherwise complete re-staging of the ''Architecture & Morality'' album. The second half of each concert featured a selection of their best known hits.\n\nIn Spring 2008, a live CD and DVD of the 2007 tour, ''[[OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More]]'', recorded at the London Hammersmith Apollo, was released as was a 25th anniversary re-release of ''Dazzle Ships'', including six bonus tracks. At the same time, a brief October 2008 tour was announced, partly to tie-in with the ''Dazzle Ships'' album's 25th anniversary. [[China Crisis]] supported OMD on this tour.\n\nIn June 2009, an orchestral concert with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] was given in Liverpool. A recording of this concert was released on DVD in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|title=OMD News: December 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209072424/http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|archivedate=9 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In November and December, the band returned to arena touring as support for [[Simple Minds]].

Spawned by earlier band [[The Id (band)|The Id]], the outfit is composed of co-founders [[Andy McCluskey]] (vocals, bass guitar) and [[Paul Humphreys]] (keyboards, vocals), along with [[Martin Cooper (musician)|Martin Cooper]] (various instruments) and [[Stuart Kershaw]] (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \"[[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Electricity]]\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 [[List of anti-war songs|anti-war song]] \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\". The band achieved broader recognition via their album ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' (1981) and its three singles, all of which were international hits.\n\nAlthough retrospectively acclaimed, the experimental ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' (1983) eroded European support. The band embraced a more straightforward pop sound on ''[[Junk Culture]]'' (1984), while continuing to experiment via newly acquired digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]; this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and yielded the 1986 hit, \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\". A year after the release of ''[[The Best of OMD]]'' (1988), creative differences rendered McCluskey the only remaining member of the group as Humphreys formed spin-off band [[The Listening Pool]]. OMD would return with a new line-up and explore the [[dance-pop]] genre: ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits. By the mid-1990s, however, electronic music had been supplanted by [[alternative rock]], and both OMD and The Listening Pool disbanded in 1996. McCluskey later conceived pop [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]], for whom he served as a principal songwriter, while Humphreys performed as half of the duo [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]].\n\nIn 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys back in the fold and began to work on material more akin to their early output. The band re-established themselves as a chart act, and kept on touring extensively. They have sold over 40 million records to date.\n\n==Roots and early years (1975\u20131978)==\nFounders [[Andy McCluskey]] and [[Paul Humphreys]] met at primary school in [[Meols]] in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved in different local groups but shared a distaste for [[Cock rock|guitar-driven rock with a macho attitude]] popular among their friends at the time.<ref>Taylor, Paul.

The pair shared a love of [[electronic music]], particularly [[Brian Eno]] and Kraftwerk.\n\nIn September 1977,<ref name=\"familytree\">Pete Frame's Rock Family Tree</ref> McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group [[The Id]], whose line-up included drummer [[Malcolm Holmes]] and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the [[Merseyside]] area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\"Julia's Song\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called ''Street to Street.'' Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side-project called VCL XI (named after a misreading of a valve from the diagram on the back cover of [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' album; the name of valve is actually written with Arabic numbers, VCL 11, and not [[Roman numerals]]). This side-project allowed them to pursue their more bizarre electronic experiments, often working with tape collages, home-made kit-built synthesisers, and [[Circuit bending|circuit-bent]] radios.\n\nIn August 1978, The Id split due to musical differences. The same month, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit [[Dalek I Love You]] as their lead singer, but quit in September.<ref name=\"familytree\"/>\n\n==Formation and first releases (1978\u201379)==\nIn September 1978, the same month he left Dalek I Love You, McCluskey rejoined Humphreys and their VCL XI project was renamed Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The name was gleaned from a list of song lyrics and ideas that were written on McCluskey's bedroom wall;<ref name=Lindgren/> the name was chosen so as not to be mistaken for a [[punk music|punk]] band.<ref>''Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed'', Dave Wilson, 2004, p. 58</ref> OMD began to gig regularly as a duo, performing to backing tracks played from a [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 4-track tape-recorder christened \"Winston\" (after the antihero of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'').

The track was supposed to be produced by the Factory Records producer [[Martin Hannett]]. However, the A-side was the band's original demo produced by their friend, owner of Winston and soon to be manager, Paul Collister under the pseudonym Chester Valentino (taken from a nightclub called Valentino's in the nearby city of [[Chester]]). The single's sleeve was designed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]], whose distinctive graphics provided OMD's public image well into the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1979 they were asked to support [[Gary Numan]] on his first major British tour. Humphreys noted, \"[Numan] gave us our first big break. He saw us opening for [[Joy Division]] and he asked us to go on tour with him... we went from the small clubs to playing huge arenas.

It had a raw, poppy, melodic synth-pop sound. Dindisc arranged for the song \"[[Messages (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Messages]]\" to be re-recorded (produced by [[gong (band)|Gong]] bassist [[Mike Howlett]]) and released as a single \u2013 it gave the band their first hit. [[David Hughes (musician)|Dave Hughes]], a founder member of Dalek I Love You who joined OMD in early 1980, is featured in the \"Messages\" video.\n\nA tour followed, Winston the tape recorder was augmented with live drums from [[Malcolm Holmes]], and [[Dalek I Love You]]'s Dave Hughes on synths. Hughes then left OMD in November 1980, replaced by Martin Cooper.\n\nThe second album ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]'' (a reference to the band which preceded Kraftwerk, founded by Kraftwerk's original members Florian Schneider-Esleben and Ralf H\u00fctter) followed later that year, recorded as a three-piece with Humphreys, McCluskey and Holmes. It was again produced by Howlett, and had a rather moodier, dark feel. The album spawned the hit single \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\", named after [[Enola Gay|the plane that dropped an atomic bomb]] on Hiroshima. The song was intended to be included on the debut album, but was left out at the final selection. The tour for this album had a 4-piece band line-up, with saxophonist Martin Cooper (another [[Dalek I Love You]] alumnus) recruited for keyboard duties. In early 1981, ''[[Record Mirror]]'' named OMD as the fourth-best band of 1980; ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' both named the group as one of the 10 best new acts of that year.<ref>West, p. 26</ref>\n\nHowlett then presided over the recording of a further hit single, \"[[Souvenir (song)|Souvenir]]\", co-written by Cooper & Humphreys. It ushered in a lush choral electronic sound. The song also became OMD's biggest UK hit to date. In November 1981, their most commercially successful album was released in the UK and Europe \u2013 ''[[Architecture & Morality]]''. The group went into the studio with Richard Mainwaring producing. Cooper then temporarily dropped out and was replaced by Mike Douglas, but this change was reversed by the time the album was released and a tour followed. The album's sound saw OMD's original synth-pop sound augmented by the [[Mellotron]], an instrument previously associated with [[prog rock]] bands. They used it to add very atmospheric swatches of string, choir, and other sounds to their palette. Two more hit singles \"Joan of Arc\" and \"[[Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)|Maid of Orleans]]\" (which became the biggest-selling single of 1982 in Germany<ref name=\"stanley\"/>) were on the album. \"Joan of Arc\" and \"Maid of Orleans\" were originally both titled \"Joan of Arc\"; the name of the latter single was changed at the insistence of the publishers and to avoid confusion. It became \"Joan of Arc (Maid of Orleans)\" and later simply \"Maid of Orleans\".\n\nIn 1983 the band lost commercial momentum somewhat, with the release of their more experimental ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' album, which mixed melancholy synth ballads and uptempo synth-pop with [[musique concr\u00e8te]] and short wave radio tape collages. It was recorded by the 4-piece Humphreys/Holmes/Cooper/McCluskey line-up, and produced by Rhett Davies. Its relative commercial failure caused a crisis of confidence for Humphreys and McCluskey and brought about a deliberate move towards the mainstream.<ref name=\"stanley\"/>\n\n===Pop-oriented recordings (1984\u20131988)===\n1984's ''[[Junk Culture]]'' was a shift to a more pop-style sound and the band used digital sampling keyboards such as the [[Fairlight CMI]] and the E-mu Emulator. The album was a success, reassuring the group about their new direction. The \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" single returned the group to the top five in the UK and was a good indicator of the group's new found sound, notably the adoption of a classic [[verse\u2013chorus form]], which is something the group had often previously avoided. In 1985, the band expanded to a sextet, featuring new band members Graham Weir (guitar, keyboards, trombone) and Neil Weir (trumpet, bass guitar), and released ''[[Crush (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Crush]]'', produced by [[Stephen Hague]] in Paris and New York. The success of the single \"[[So in Love (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|So in Love]]\" in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] also led to some success for the [[LP album|LP]] which entered the [[American Top 40]], establishing the group in the US and making Stephen Hague a sought-after producer. During this period, the band also recorded a special version of \"So in Love\" in duet with the French pop singer [[Etienne Daho]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eclipstv.fr/videos/omd-etienne-daho-so-in-love-les-enfants-du-rock-1986-2159|title=OMD & Etienne Daho - So in love (Les Enfants du Rock 1986)|website=Eclipstv.fr}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1985 the band was asked to write a song for the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. They selected \"Goddess of Love\". The ending of the film was re shot. After the song received a negative reaction from test groups, OMD wrote \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\" in less than 24 hours<ref name=Lindgren/> and it became a top 5 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand in 1986. At the end of this year, the same six piece line-up also released ''[[The Pacific Age]]'', but the band began to see their critical and public popularity wane notably in the UK. The album's first single, \"[[(Forever) Live and Die]]\", was a top 10 hit across Europe<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/OMD-(Orchestral-Manoeuvres-In-The-Dark)/(Forever)-Live-And-Die-1517|title=OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark) - (Forever) Live And Die|website=Hitparade.ch}}</ref> and entered the top 20 in both the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/(forever)-live-and-die/|title=(forever) live and die &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> and US. Journalist [[Hugo Lindgren]] argued that the success of \"If You Leave\" has concealed from US audiences the group's history of making innovative music.<ref name=Lindgren/>\n\n==Split and McCluskey-led OMD (1989\u20131996)==\nDuring 1988 the band appeared poised to consolidate their US success, with a support slot for [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Music for the Masses Tour]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California on 18 June 1988, a top 20 US hit with \"Dreaming\" and a successful \"Best of\" album. However, it was at this point when OMD broke in two. Graham and Neil Weir left at the end of the 1988 US tour and co-founder Paul Humphreys subsequently called it a day, unhappy with the band's commercial orientation. Finally, Cooper and Holmes left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called [[the Listening Pool]] in 1989.\n\nIt left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the [[dance-pop]] ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' album in May 1991, which charted at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, [[Stuart Kershaw]], Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of ''Sugar Tax'': writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like \"[[Sailing on the Seven Seas]]\" and \"[[Pandora's Box (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Pandora's Box]]\", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, \"[[Call My Name (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Call My Name]]\" and \"[[Then You Turn Away]]\". McCluskey's live band was then formed by [[Nigel Ipinson]] (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) since late 1990. Kershaw, Ipinson, and Coxon from 1992 to 1996 contributed to OMD albums and a 1993 tour.\n\nThe album ''[[Liberator (album)|Liberator]]'' was released in 1993. It peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Lead single \"[[Stand Above Me]]\" peaked at no. 21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], with follow-up \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\" charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \"[[Everyday (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Everyday]]\" (a No. 59 UK chart entry).\n\nThe fifth track from Liberator, \"[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]\", was built around a sample from \"[[Love's Theme]]\" by [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a track which was written and produced by [[Barry White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/Discography-Liberator.html |title=Liberator |website=Omd.uk.com |accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> To release the \"Dream of Me\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \"Love's Theme\" sample, but still be officially titled \"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White.\n\nAlso in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the ''[[Esperanto (Elektric Music album)|Esperanto]]'' album, a project by former [[Kraftwerk]] member [[Karl Bartos]] (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music).\n\nMcCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the 1996 album ''[[Universal (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Universal]]'', which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the ''Esperanto'' sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \"[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]\".\n\n==Disbandment (1996)==\nThough both ''Liberator'' and ''Universal'' produced minor hits, McCluskey retired the OMD name in late 1996, due to waning public interest. A second [[The OMD Singles|singles album]] was released in 1998, along with an [[Extended play|EP]] of remixed material by such acts as [[Sash!]] and [[Moby]].\n\nPost-1996, McCluskey decided to focus on songwriting for such Liverpool based acts as [[Atomic Kitten]] and the Genie Queen, and trying to develop new Merseyside artists from his Motor Museum recording studio. With McCluskey focusing his talents elsewhere, Humphreys decided to work with his new musical partner [[Claudia Br\u00fccken]], of the [[ZTT]] bands [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] and [[Act (band)|Act]], as [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]]. He also undertook a US live tour under the banner Paul Humphreys from OMD.\n\n==Reformation (2006\u2013present)==\nAn unexpected request to perform from a German Television show and McCluskey's divorce led the group to reform.<ref name=Lindgren/> On 1 January 2006, Andy McCluskey announced plans to reform OMD with the McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes, and Cooper line-up. The original plan was to tour the album ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' and other pre-1983 material, then record a new album set for release in 2007.\n\nIn May 2007, the ''Architecture & Morality'' remastered CD was re-released together with a DVD featuring the Drury Lane concert from 1981 that had previously been available on VHS. Through May and June, the band toured with the \"classic\" line up of McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes and Cooper. They began their set with a re-ordered but otherwise complete re-staging of the ''Architecture & Morality'' album. The second half of each concert featured a selection of their best known hits.\n\nIn Spring 2008, a live CD and DVD of the 2007 tour, ''[[OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More]]'', recorded at the London Hammersmith Apollo, was released as was a 25th anniversary re-release of ''Dazzle Ships'', including six bonus tracks. At the same time, a brief October 2008 tour was announced, partly to tie-in with the ''Dazzle Ships'' album's 25th anniversary. [[China Crisis]] supported OMD on this tour.\n\nIn June 2009, an orchestral concert with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] was given in Liverpool. A recording of this concert was released on DVD in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|title=OMD News: December 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209072424/http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|archivedate=9 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In November and December, the band returned to arena touring as support for [[Simple Minds]].
