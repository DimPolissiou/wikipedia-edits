In November 1984 the group issued their debut studio album, ''Tales of the Unexpected'', and a single, \"Ocean Liner\". In 1985 the band toured the United Kingdom supporting Hot label mates, [[The Triffids]]. The Lighthouse Keepers combined a \"loosely rehearsed, casual ethos\"<ref name=\"Clinton\"/> with humour, punk attitudes and pure pop song craft. The ensemble disbanded in 1986, releasing a compilation album, ''Imploding'', in November that year. According to rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], their \"tasteful, jangly brand of country-tinged folk rock was at odds with prevailing trends on Sydney's early 1980s, Detroit-besotted independent scene. The band nevertheless issued a number of albums and singles, and always lived up to audience expectations\".\n\n==Formation==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers (initially known as The Light-Housekeepers)<sup id=\"nbFoot01a\" class=\"reference\">[[#noteFoot01a|[A]]]</sup> founders Greg Appel on acoustic guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals, and Stephen O'Neil on drums, bass, guitar and saxophone<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> were members of Canberra-based groups The Grant Brothers and Guthugga Pipeline. The pair were joined by Juliet Ward on vocals, bass guitar and keyboards<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> as Tex Truck and the Semis, for a [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (UTS) student talent quest. In 1981 augmented by Michael \"Blue\" Dalton on slide guitar, dobro, bass guitar and harmonica they formed The Lighthouse Keepers.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Dalton was a vintage music enthusiast<ref name=\"Clinton\" /> who contributed a country blues style to arrangements as a foil to multi-instrumentalist O'Neil's nifty and melodic bass, drums, guitar and [[C melody sax]] playing, further complementing the rich timbre and interpretive abilities of vocalist Ward, with Appel's understated but skilfully rendered jangling [[Maton]] brand [[12 string guitar]]. All members rotated to bass playing duties both on stage and also in the studio to facilitate various song arrangements.\n\n==Musical influences==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers' repertoire was initially steeped in country, blues, folk, pop and jazz which later infused Appel's melodic and lyrically engaging songs melded with emotionally charged vocals by Ward. Along with subtle somewhat larrikin humour, stories dealing with suburban teenage angst<ref name=\"SadTale\"/> and interpersonal relationships, were bitter sweet love songs, a couple of instrumental contributions from O'Neil and Appel, plus a sprinkling of cover versions highlighting their musical influences, for example, '[[St James Infirmary Blues]]' and '[[Big Noise from Winnetka]]'. Other diverse influences included Australian country musician, [[Chad Morgan]], American C&W songs such as '[[A Dear John Letter]]' and Sun Records era [[rockabilly]] artists including early [[Narvel Felts]], as well as the newly emerging and more contemporary British American and Australian independent bands of the time.\n\n==Early recordings==\n{{Listen | filename =  | title = Cigareetes and Whusky  | description = <small>\"Chaos\" reigned during the shambolic evolution of Tex Truck & the Semis to Light-Housekeepers</small> | pos = left}}\nThe Lighthouse Keepers' early [[compact cassette|cassette]] recordings include a live performance (replete with Ward's dog \"Chaos\" contributing back up vocals) of a [[Tim Spencer (singer)|Tim Spencer]] composition \"Cigareetes and Whusky\", originally recorded by [[The Sons of the Pioneers]], the [[Willie Dixon]] Big Three Trio and [[Red Ingle]]. A demo version of the country standard \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" (popularised by [[Patsy Cline]]), was recorded in late 1982 on a Sony 4-track and mixed to cassette, with vocals by Ward accompanied by Appel on acoustic guitar who later [[overdubbed]] bass and slide guitars.\n\n==\"Gargoyle\"==\n[[File:Gargoyle Guthugga Pipeline Records GPR001.png|right|200px|thumb|\n{{H:title|This one by Greg Appel, the song's composer.| Example of hand drawn disc label for initial release of ''Gargoyle'' on Guthugga Pipeline Records.(GPR 001) A-side |dotted=no}}]]\nIn 1983 The Lighthouse Keepers issued their first single, \"Gargoyle\", as a three-track [[Gramophone record#Formats|7&nbsp;inch vinyl]] 45rpm on their own independent label, Guthugga Pipeline Records. Early pressings sported individually hand drawn disc labels and cover art with the words \"<small>''Strike a Lighthouse!''</small>\" etched near the [[matrix numbers]] of the run-out grooves.\n\nThe A-side, a somewhat licht gothic-styled track, \"Gargoyle\", featured vocals by Ward. Its B-side had two tracks: the rockabilly influenced \"Demolition Team\", and the 12-string, groove driven \"Quick Sticks\", both sung by Appel. All three original compositions were written by Appel and recorded at the band's request as \"first takes\", Appel playing guitars with O'Neil on a borrowed drum kit. Bass guitar was overdubbed by Appel with some harmonica and slide guitar contributed by Dalton, along with [[doubletracking]] of Ward's vocals. The 12-string guitar parts utilised a stomp box [[effects unit]] compressor.\n \nThe recording was done at Dream Studios Mk3 for $50 ('studio opening rate') plus tape costs, on a 1/2&nbsp;inch [[8-track (multitrack)|8-track]] reel to reel analog tape recorder running at 7 1/2 ips and mixed to 1/4&nbsp;inch 2-track 15 ips using Auratone 5c sound cubes for referencing.\n\nThe audio engineers, in keeping with the prevailing [[DIY]], [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] '[[zeitgeist]]', encouraged the band to purchase their own blank tapes and follow the production process from mastering by Don Bartley at EMI's Sydney Studios, to \"test pressing\" (see [[white label]]) at EMI's Homebush record plant where the discs were manufactured through EMI's custom pressing service, which was also commonly used by local bands and emerging independent record labels such as M squared. Production costs were financed independently by the band.\n\n==''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (1983)==\n[[File:Exploding LHK label A.png|right|200px|thumb|''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (GPR 004) A-side]]\n[[File:Exploding LHK label B.png|right|200px|thumb|''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (GPR 004) B-side]]\nIn mid-1983, the Lighthouse Keepers added Steven Williams on drums and as their [[talent manager|manager]] \u2013 Williams was also a member of post punk band The Particles with O'Neil.<ref name=\"Particles1\"/><ref name=\"Particles2\"/> In November The Lighthouse Keepers released a second recording on their own Guthugga Pipeline label. The self-produced and -distributed 12-inch 45&nbsp;rpm six-track \"[[Lo-fi music|Lo-fi]]\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> extended play was titled ''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers''. The EP showcased another five of Appel's songs and musical arrangements plus a cover version of the [[Bo Carter]] country blues song \"Whisky and Gin\", recorded direct to a Technics 15&nbsp;ips {{frac|1|4}}-inch 2-track in the bathroom of a Redfern terrace.\n\nOpening with \"Springtime\", the EP highlighted the country blues style harmonica of Dalton which was in part characteristic of the Lighthouse Keepers' sound. The disc heralded the introduction of brass instruments into the group's instrumental range which continued in subsequent recordings. [[Trumpet]] player Alex Hamilton, who also played the solo on The Particles track \"I Luv Trumpet\", contributed overdubbed brass lines on \"Bad Mood\" and the duet intro for country ballad \"Again\". Musical arrangements were embellished with keyboard and [[tambourine]] played by Ward with additional percussion by O'Neil. The integration of the driving pop sensibility of drummer Williams, allowed O'Neil to add second guitar parts to \"The Beat\" and \"Narvel Felts\". Album cover artwork was by Appel with the record sleeve insert artwork attributed to Fabian.\n\nWith the exception of \"Whiskey and Gin\", all tracks were recorded conventionally: live instrumental backing tracks (with guide vocals retained and later doubled to form a composite vocal track) whilst drums were sub mixed to stereo to allow space for overdubs. Recording was again done at Peter Hornak's,<ref name=\"Hornak\"/> Dream Studio Mk3, located in an old warehouse in the historic Haymarket area of Sydney.\n\n==''Tales of the Unexpected'' (1984)==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers signed to Hot Records where their diverse label mates included Wet Taxis, [[The Triffids]] and [[Laughing Clowns]].<ref name=\"HotRecords\"/> In August 1984 the label re-issued \"Gargoyle\" and followed in November with the band's first studio album, \"Tales of the Unexpected\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> which resulted in their most successful single \"Ocean Liner\". The album was recorded during August at Paradise Studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney by David Price, assisted by Tom Colley, the house engineers . The recording facility featured Westlake Audio monitors (cross referenced by [[Yamaha NS-10]] near field monitors), twin MCI 24-track tape recorders, Harrison automated mixing console and 'state of the art' acoustic design and microphones. The album was recorded and mixed at 30ips during ten \"discount rate\" consecutive midnight to dawn sessions. It was produced by The Lighthouse Keepers and John Basett and mixed by Price, LHK and Basett. Additional musicians provided mandolin, banjo, baritone sax, trombone and trumpet. The band rose to the challenges of working at a professional level, taking the opportunity to develop their own distinctive sound and musical direction. Mastering, test pressing and record production from stampers was completed at the CBS studios (see also [[Columbia records]]). The album cover painting artwork was by O'Neil.\n\n==Career highlights==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers are described in various rock music publications, including ''[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]''(1999)<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> ''The Who's Who of Australian Rock'' (2002),<ref name=\"SpencerLightHK\"/> ''Inner City Sound'' (2005),<ref name=\"Walker\"/> and ''Blunt: A Biased History of Australian Rock'' (2001).<ref name=\"Blunt\"/> They were also favourably reviewed by [[Stuart Coupe]] in the ''Sun Herald''.<ref name=\"Coupe\"/> as well as sections of the local rock press who were generally supportive of indie bands, including ''On the Street'',<ref name=\"Carey\"/> ''RAM'',<ref name=\"Smith\"/><ref name=\"Cadbury\"/> ''Juke''<ref name=\"McFarlaneJuke\"/> and other publications.<ref name=\"Sly\"/><ref name=\"Elizer\"/><ref name=\"Jamrozik\"/> The Lighthouse Keepers received airplay through the alternative radio stations [[2SER]], [[2JJJ]] and similar community radio networks interstate. They garnered glowing reviews in the British music journals, ''[[NME]]''<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.<ref name=\"Traitor\"/> They supported international artists touring Australia such as [[Jonathan Richman]] and [[John Cooper Clarke]] (1983) and [[The Violent Femmes]], as well as the Brisbane band [[The Go-Betweens]] (1984). They built up a loyal following whilst performing regularly along the Australian east coast with occasional treks westwards across the [[Nullabor Plain]] to Perth. The Lighthouse Keepers undertook a low key tour of Europe in 1985,<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> which included an outdoor festival in Rotterdam headlined by The Triffids and [[The Woodentops]], as well as gigs in Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Austria, returning to England to support The Triffids at Leeds University, the Clarendon Hammersmith and other shows in and around London.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\n==''Implosion'' (1986)==\nEarly in 1986 The Lighthouse Keepers returned to Australia and disbanded after a career including over 350 performances.<ref name=\"Gigography\"/> On 28 March they held a farewell show at the Graphics Arts Club, [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]].<ref name=\"Gigography\"/><ref name=\"Kendall\"/><ref name=\"Forbes2\"/> In November, [[Waterfront Records]] released their compilation album, 'Imploding'. The runout groove on side-B read \"<small>''Would the last person to leave please turn-out the lighthouse''</small>\".<ref name=\"Implosion\"/>\n\n==Reunions==\nSince disbanding, The Lighthouse Keepers have reunited sporadically to play private parties, launch their own 2\u00d7 CD compilation, \"Lipsnipegroin\", at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney (1992) and help launch the 2\u00d7 CD various artists compilation, 'Tales from the Australian Underground' at the Metro in Sydney (2003).<ref>Long way to the middle? - Bernard Zuel - Fairfax Digital - ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 23 May 2003 \u2013 http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/22/1053585641510.html</ref><ref>Feel Presents - Tales from the Australian Underground  - http://www.discogs.com/Various-Tales-From-The-Australian-Underground-Singles-1976-1989/release/1087412</ref> They have also played tribute shows,<ref>\"Life's what you make it\" - A Tribute to Linda Gebar : 18 February 2009 \u2013 The Corner Hotel: Fitzroy [Melbourne] ~ http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/News/AllEvents/MusicIndustryTributetoLindaGebar.aspx</ref> benefits, (2009) and opened both nights of the final leg of a Laughing Clowns reformation tour at the Basement in Sydney (2009).<ref>Ed Kuepper - news item at The Dwarf.com.au - Lisa Dib 17 Feb. 2009 http://www.thedwarf.com.au/index.php/nd/news/national/ed_kuepper_is_a_bad_seed_laughing_clowns</ref>\n\nIn August 2011, a further compilation of The Lighthouse Keepers' material \"ode to nothing\" <ref>Feel Presents - ode to nothing -http://www.facebook.com/notes/feel-presents/lighthouse-keepers-ode-to-nothing/220579481301220.</ref><ref>guitarist Greg Appel talks to Aaron Curran of Mess and Noise-6, Sept 2011 ~ http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/4324588</ref> was issued as a 15-track remastered \"best of\" CD.<ref>that Striped Sunlight Sound blog 18, Aug 2011 ~  http://stripedsunlight.blogspot.com/search?q=the+lighthouse+keepers</ref><ref>CD review 7 Sept 2011 courtesy Sludge Factory webzine ~http://sludgefactory.com.au/lighthouse-keepers-ode-nothing-cd-review {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095131/http://sludgefactory.com.au/lighthouse-keepers-ode-nothing-cd-review |date=28 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>CD Review - Natalie Salvo - 11 Sept 2011-courtesy the au review ~ http://www.theaureview.com/albums/the-lighthouse-keepers-ode-to-nothing-2011-lp</ref> They were joined by Perth-based drummer Hugh Veldon for a well attended and reviewed<ref>Singing and giggling along, just as we did 27 years ago - Bernard Zuel - Sydney Morning Herald: http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/singing-and-giggling-along-just-as-we-did-27-years-ago-20110911-1k406.html#ixzz1Zc4glifN</ref><ref>Live review courtesy Sludge Factory webzine - 13 September 2011 ~ http://sludgefactory.com.au/lighthouse-keepers-gig-review {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328095148/http://sludgefactory.com.au/lighthouse-keepers-gig-review |date=28 March 2012 }}</ref> live show at the Sandringham Hotel Sydney September (2011) followed by a string of suburban gigs during January and February 2012 in Melbourne, Canberra<ref>Light still burns bright - LHK vocalist Juliet Ward interview - The Canberra Times - 2 February 2012 \u2013 http://www.canberratimes.com.au/blogs/fly/light-still-burns-bright/2441733.aspx?storypage=0{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Yay for the Lighthouse Keepers - Ampersand Duck blog, Saturday, February 4, 2012 \u2013 http://ampersandduck.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/yay-for-lighthouse-keepers.html#links</ref> with the final performance in Sydney at Marrickville.

In November 1984 the group issued their debut studio album, ''Tales of the Unexpected'', and a single, \"Ocean Liner\". In 1985 the band toured the United Kingdom supporting fellow Australian label mates, [[The Triffids]]. The Lighthouse Keepers combined a \"loosely rehearsed, casual ethos\"<ref name=\"Clinton\"/> with humour, punk attitudes and pure pop song craft. The ensemble disbanded in 1986, releasing a compilation album, ''Imploding'', in November that year. According to rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], their \"tasteful, jangly brand of country-tinged folk rock was at odds with prevailing trends on Sydney's early 1980s, Detroit-besotted independent scene. The band nevertheless issued a number of albums and singles, and always lived up to audience expectations\".\n\n==Formation==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers (initially known as The Light-Housekeepers)<sup id=\"nbFoot01a\" class=\"reference\">[[#noteFoot01a|[A]]]</sup> founders Greg Appel on acoustic guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals, and Stephen O'Neil on drums, bass, guitar and saxophone<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> were members of Canberra-based groups The Grant Brothers and Guthugga Pipeline. The pair were joined by Juliet Ward on vocals, bass guitar and keyboards<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> as Tex Truck and the Semis, for a [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (UTS) student talent quest. In 1981 augmented by Michael \"Blue\" Dalton on slide guitar, dobro, bass guitar and harmonica they formed The Lighthouse Keepers.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Dalton was a vintage music enthusiast<ref name=\"Clinton\" /> who contributed a country blues style to arrangements as a foil to multi-instrumentalist O'Neil's nifty and melodic bass, drums, guitar and [[C melody sax]] playing, further complementing the rich timbre and interpretive abilities of vocalist Ward, with Appel's understated but skilfully rendered jangling [[Maton]] brand [[12 string guitar]]. All members rotated to bass playing duties both on stage and also in the studio to facilitate various song arrangements.\n\n==Musical influences==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers' repertoire was initially steeped in country, blues, folk, pop and jazz which later infused Appel's melodic and lyrically engaging songs melded with emotionally charged vocals by Ward. Along with subtle somewhat larrikin humour, stories dealing with suburban teenage angst<ref name=\"SadTale\"/> and interpersonal relationships, were bitter sweet love songs, a couple of instrumental contributions from O'Neil and Appel, plus a sprinkling of cover versions highlighting their musical influences, for example, '[[St James Infirmary Blues]]' and '[[Big Noise from Winnetka]]'. Other diverse influences included Australian country musician, [[Chad Morgan]], American C&W songs such as '[[A Dear John Letter]]' and Sun Records era [[rockabilly]] artists including early [[Narvel Felts]], as well as the newly emerging and more contemporary British American and Australian independent bands of the time.\n\n==Early recordings==\n{{Listen | filename =  | title = Cigareetes and Whusky  | description = <small>\"Chaos\" reigned during the shambolic evolution of Tex Truck & the Semis to Light-Housekeepers</small> | pos = left}}\nThe Lighthouse Keepers' early [[compact cassette|cassette]] recordings include a live performance (replete with Ward's dog \"Chaos\" contributing back up vocals) of a [[Tim Spencer (singer)|Tim Spencer]] composition \"Cigareetes and Whusky\", originally recorded by [[The Sons of the Pioneers]], the [[Willie Dixon]] Big Three Trio and [[Red Ingle]]. A demo version of the country standard \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" (popularised by [[Patsy Cline]]), was recorded in late 1982 on a Sony 4-track and mixed to cassette, with vocals by Ward accompanied by Appel on acoustic guitar who later [[overdubbed]] bass and slide guitars.\n\n==\"Gargoyle\"==\n[[File:Gargoyle Guthugga Pipeline Records GPR001.png|right|200px|thumb|\n{{H:title|This one by Greg Appel, the song's composer.| Example of hand drawn disc label for initial release of ''Gargoyle'' on Guthugga Pipeline Records.(GPR 001) A-side |dotted=no}}]]\nIn 1983 The Lighthouse Keepers issued their first single, \"Gargoyle\", as a three-track [[Gramophone record#Formats|7&nbsp;inch vinyl]] 45rpm on their own independent label, Guthugga Pipeline Records. Early pressings sported individually hand drawn disc labels and cover art with the words \"<small>''Strike a Lighthouse!''</small>\" etched near the [[matrix numbers]] of the run-out grooves.\n\nThe A-side, a somewhat licht gothic-styled track, \"Gargoyle\", featured vocals by Ward. Its B-side had two tracks: the rockabilly influenced \"Demolition Team\", and the 12-string, groove driven \"Quick Sticks\", both sung by Appel. All three original compositions were written by Appel and recorded at the band's request as \"first takes\", Appel playing guitars with O'Neil on a borrowed drum kit. Bass guitar was overdubbed by Appel with some harmonica and slide guitar contributed by Dalton, along with [[doubletracking]] of Ward's vocals. The 12-string guitar parts utilised a stomp box [[effects unit]] compressor.\n \nThe recording was done at Dream Studios Mk3 for $50 ('studio opening rate') plus tape costs, on a 1/2&nbsp;inch [[8-track (multitrack)|8-track]] reel to reel analog tape recorder running at 7 1/2 ips and mixed to 1/4&nbsp;inch 2-track 15 ips using Auratone 5c sound cubes for referencing.\n\nThe audio engineers, in keeping with the prevailing [[DIY]], [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] '[[zeitgeist]]', encouraged the band to purchase their own blank tapes and follow the production process from mastering by Don Bartley at EMI's Sydney Studios, to \"test pressing\" (see [[white label]]) at EMI's Homebush record plant where the discs were manufactured through EMI's custom pressing service, which was also commonly used by local bands and emerging independent record labels such as M squared. Production costs were financed independently by the band.\n\n==''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (1983)==\n[[File:Exploding LHK label A.png|right|200px|thumb|''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (GPR 004) A-side]]\n[[File:Exploding LHK label B.png|right|200px|thumb|''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers'' (GPR 004) B-side]]\nIn mid-1983, the Lighthouse Keepers added Steven Williams on drums and as their [[talent manager|manager]] \u2013 Williams was also a member of post punk band The Particles with O'Neil.<ref name=\"Particles1\"/><ref name=\"Particles2\"/> In November The Lighthouse Keepers released a second recording on their own Guthugga Pipeline label. The self-produced and -distributed 12-inch 45&nbsp;rpm six-track \"[[Lo-fi music|Lo-fi]]\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> extended play was titled ''The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers''. The EP showcased another five of Appel's songs and musical arrangements plus a cover version of the [[Bo Carter]] country blues song \"Whisky and Gin\", recorded direct to a Technics 15&nbsp;ips {{frac|1|4}}-inch 2-track in the bathroom of a Redfern terrace.\n\nOpening with \"Springtime\", the EP highlighted the country blues style harmonica of Dalton which was in part characteristic of the Lighthouse Keepers' sound. The disc heralded the introduction of brass instruments into the group's instrumental range which continued in subsequent recordings. [[Trumpet]] player Alex Hamilton, who also played the solo on The Particles track \"I Luv Trumpet\", contributed overdubbed brass lines on \"Bad Mood\" and the duet intro for country ballad \"Again\". Musical arrangements were embellished with keyboard and [[tambourine]] played by Ward with additional percussion by O'Neil. The integration of the driving pop sensibility of drummer Williams, allowed O'Neil to add second guitar parts to \"The Beat\" and \"Narvel Felts\". Album cover artwork was by Appel with the record sleeve insert artwork attributed to Fabian.\n\nWith the exception of \"Whiskey and Gin\", all tracks were recorded conventionally: live instrumental backing tracks (with guide vocals retained and later doubled to form a composite vocal track) whilst drums were sub mixed to stereo to allow space for overdubs. Recording was again done at Peter Hornak's,<ref name=\"Hornak\"/> Dream Studio Mk3, located in an old warehouse in the historic Haymarket area of Sydney.\n\n==''Tales of the Unexpected'' (1984)==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers signed to Hot Records where their diverse label mates included Wet Taxis, [[The Triffids]] and [[Laughing Clowns]].<ref name=\"HotRecords\"/> In August 1984 the label re-issued \"Gargoyle\" and followed in November with the band's first studio album, \"Tales of the Unexpected\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> which resulted in their most successful single \"Ocean Liner\". The album was recorded during August at Paradise Studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney by David Price, assisted by Tom Colley, the house engineers . The recording facility featured Westlake Audio monitors (cross referenced by [[Yamaha NS-10]] near field monitors), twin MCI 24-track tape recorders, Harrison automated mixing console and 'state of the art' acoustic design and microphones. The album was recorded and mixed at 30ips during ten \"discount rate\" consecutive midnight to dawn sessions. It was produced by The Lighthouse Keepers and John Basett and mixed by Price, LHK and Basett. Additional musicians provided mandolin, banjo, baritone sax, trombone and trumpet. The band rose to the challenges of working at a professional level, taking the opportunity to develop their own distinctive sound and musical direction. Mastering, test pressing and record production from stampers was completed at the CBS studios (see also [[Columbia records]]). The album cover painting artwork was by O'Neil.\n\n==Career highlights==\nThe Lighthouse Keepers are described in various rock music publications, including ''[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]''(1999)<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> ''The Who's Who of Australian Rock'' (2002),<ref name=\"SpencerLightHK\"/> ''Inner City Sound'' (2005),<ref name=\"Walker\"/> and ''Blunt: A Biased History of Australian Rock'' (2001).<ref name=\"Blunt\"/> They were also favourably reviewed by [[Stuart Coupe]] in the ''Sun Herald''.<ref name=\"Coupe\"/> as well as sections of the local rock press who were generally supportive of indie bands, including ''On the Street'',<ref name=\"Carey\"/> ''RAM'',<ref name=\"Smith\"/><ref name=\"Cadbury\"/> ''Juke''<ref name=\"McFarlaneJuke\"/> and other publications.<ref name=\"Sly\"/><ref name=\"Elizer\"/><ref name=\"Jamrozik\"/> The Lighthouse Keepers received airplay through the alternative radio stations [[2SER]], [[2JJJ]] and similar community radio networks interstate. They garnered glowing reviews in the British music journals, ''[[NME]]''<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.<ref name=\"Traitor\"/> They supported international artists touring Australia such as [[Jonathan Richman]] and [[John Cooper Clarke]] (1983) and [[The Violent Femmes]], as well as the Brisbane band [[The Go-Betweens]] (1984).

It features [[Andrew McCarthy]] and [[Evan Williams (actor)|Evan Williams]] as father and son on a road-trip from [[Oregon]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] transporting their own [[Sitka Spruce]] tree on a truck to be planted across from the [[White House]] on [[Thanksgiving]]. The film was produced and aired by [[Hallmark Channel]].\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen-year-old Rock Burdock (Evan Williams) wins a nationwide contest for his tree to be planted across the [[White House]]. Faith Russel (Kari Matchett), marketing representative of the company Box of Toys who is in charge of the project, visits Rock and his father Corey (Andrew McCarthy). Corey planted the tree in their garden when Rock was born. He has reservations about the idea of transporting his tree cross country, but agrees under the condition that they deliver the tree themselves. While father and son drive the truck, Faith follows them most of the time in her car. Father and son are unable to strengthen their bonding and further dissensions arise along the way. However, Rock films the entire trip on camera and posts it on his [[vlog]]. This gathers more and more fans on the internet and on the road and even causes some media coverage. Rock's internet acquaintance and love interest Katie ([[Paula Brancati]]) joins Rock on the way. Together they reach [[Washington, D.C.]] on Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, Faith's boss ([[Ted Atherton]]) secretly changed the plan. He wants to repeat the contest every year and therefore decides to erect the tree rather than planting it. After Faith's attempts to persuade her boss fail, the team now cuffs Rock to the tree and protest against its destruction. Using their media attention soon more people support their protest.

It features [[Andrew McCarthy]] and [[Evan Williams (actor)|Evan Williams]] as father and son on a road-trip from [[Oregon]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] transporting their own [[Sitka Spruce]] tree on a truck to be planted across from the [[White House]] on [[Thanksgiving]]. The film was produced and aired by [[Hallmark Channel]].\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen-year-old Rock Burdock (Evan Williams) wins a nationwide contest for his tree to be planted across the [[White House]]. Faith Russel (Kari Matchett), marketing representative of the company Box of Toys who is in charge of the project, visits Rock and his father Corey (Andrew McCarthy). Corey planted the tree in their garden when Rock was born. He has reservations about the idea of transporting his tree cross country, but agrees under the condition that they deliver the tree themselves. While father and son drive the truck, Faith follows them most of the time in her car. Father and son are unable to strengthen their bonding and further dissensions arise along the way. However, Rock films the entire trip on camera and posts it on his [[vlog]]. This gathers more and more fans on the internet and on the road and even causes some media coverage. Rock's internet acquaintance and love interest Katie ([[Paula Brancati]]) joins Rock on the way. Together they reach [[Washington, D.C.]] on Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, Faith's boss ([[Ted Atherton]]) secretly changed the plan. He wants to repeat the contest every year and therefore decides to erect the tree rather than planting it. After Faith's attempts to persuade her boss fail, the team now cuffs Rock to the tree and protest against its destruction. Using their media attention soon more people support their protest. Finally the [[President of the United States]] calls the [[Park ranger]] on his cell phone and tells him to plant the tree. Later Rock, Corey, Faith and Katie are invited to attend the Christmas lighting of the tree by the President.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Corey Burdock\n* Evan Williams as Rock Burdock\n* [[Kari Matchett]] as Faith Russell\n* [[Paula Brancati]] as Katie\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Lana\n* [[Ted Atherton]] as Aaron\n* Craig Eldridge as Jim\n* Trent McMullen as Hank\n* Vas Saranga as Ash\n* Amanda Joy Lim as Ming\n* Kristina Nicoll as Belinda\n* Jean Daigle as Eddie\n* B.J.

The [[voivode]] [[Peter Golovin]], leader of the tsarist forces, responded with a reign of terror: native settlements were torched and hundreds of people were killed.

{"title_page": "History of the Polish Army", "text_new": "{{Polish Army}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2011}}\nThe '''Polish Army''' ({{lang-pl|[[Wojsko Polskie]]}}) is the name applied to the military forces of [[Poland]]. The name has been in use since the early 19th century, although it can be used to refer to earlier formations as well. Polish Armed Forces consist of the [[Polish Army|Army]] (''{{lang|pl|Wojsko L\u0105dowe}}''), [[Polish Navy|Navy]] (''{{lang|pl|Marynarka}}'') and [[Polish Air Force|Air Force]] (''{{lang|pl|Lotnictwo}}'') branches and are under the command of the Ministry of National Defense (''{{lang|pl|Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej}}'').\n\n==History==\n\n===Kingdom of Poland (10th century\u20131569)===\n{{main|Warfare in Medieval Poland}}\n[[Image:Polish helmet from X century.PNG|left|thumb|upright|[[Helmet]] of Polish [[druzhina|dru\u017cyna]] from the 10th century]]\nThe first Polish Army was created in the 10th century [[monarchy|kingdom]] of Poland, under the [[Piast]] dynasty. The prince's forces were composed of a group of armed men, usually mounted, named dru\u017cyna. Their key role was the protection of the monarch and supporting the taxation effort. Their organisation was similar to other such armed units of other [[Slavs|Slavic]] rulers, and were often of foreign origin.\n\nWith time, the early [[tribe|tribal]] [[warrior]]s gave rise to [[knight]]s and eventually, by the 15th century, the whole [[social class]] of the [[szlachta]] or Polish gentry. The Polish gentry formed a distinct element within the ancient tribal groupings. This is uncertain, however, as there is little documentation on the early history of Poland, or of the movements of the Slavonic people into what became the territory so designated.\n\nAround the 14th century, there was little difference between those called knights and those referred to as szlachta in Poland. Members of the szlachta had the personal obligation to defend the country ([[pospolite ruszenie]]), and thereby became the kingdom's privileged social class. It was them who were obliged to build and support castles as well as to keep peace and order on territory they were assigned.\n\n===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795)===\n[[Image:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a Commonwealth [[husaria]].]]\n{{main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army}}\nThe armies of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], or the First Polish Republic, were commanded by four [[hetman]]s.

The name has been in use since the early 19th century, although it can be used to refer to earlier formations as well. Polish Armed Forces consist of the [[Polish Army|Army]] (''{{lang|pl|Wojsko L\u0105dowe}}''), [[Polish Navy|Navy]] (''{{lang|pl|Marynarka}}'') and [[Polish Air Force|Air Force]] (''{{lang|pl|Lotnictwo}}'') branches and are under the command of the Ministry of National Defense (''{{lang|pl|Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej}}'').\n\n==History==\n\n===Kingdom of Poland (10th century\u20131569)===\n{{main|Warfare in Medieval Poland}}\n[[Image:Polish helmet from X century.PNG|left|thumb|upright|[[Helmet]] of Polish [[druzhina|dru\u017cyna]] from the 10th century]]\nThe first Polish Army was created in the 10th century [[monarchy|kingdom]] of Poland, under the [[Piast]] dynasty. The prince's forces were composed of a group of armed men, usually mounted, named dru\u017cyna. Their key role was the protection of the monarch and supporting the taxation effort. Their organisation was similar to other such armed units of other [[Slavs|Slavic]] rulers, and were often of foreign origin.\n\nWith time, the early [[tribe|tribal]] [[warrior]]s gave rise to [[knight]]s and eventually, by the 15th century, the whole [[social class]] of the [[szlachta]] or Polish gentry. The Polish gentry formed a distinct element within the ancient tribal groupings. This is uncertain, however, as there is little documentation on the early history of Poland, or of the movements of the Slavonic people into what became the territory so designated.\n\nAround the 14th century, there was little difference between those called knights and those referred to as szlachta in Poland. Members of the szlachta had the personal obligation to defend the country ([[pospolite ruszenie]]), and thereby became the kingdom's privileged social class. It was them who were obliged to build and support castles as well as to keep peace and order on territory they were assigned.\n\n===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795)===\n[[Image:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a Commonwealth [[husaria]].]]\n{{main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army}}\nThe armies of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], or the First Polish Republic, were commanded by four [[hetman]]s.
