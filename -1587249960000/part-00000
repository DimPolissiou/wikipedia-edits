However, [[Tsitsernakaberd|The Armenian Genocide Museum]] defines cultural genocide as \"acts and measures undertaken to destroy nations' or ethnic groups' culture through spiritual, national, and cultural destruction.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/cultural_genocide.php|title=Genocide Museum {{!}} The Armenian Genocide Museum-institute|website=www.genocide-museum.am|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> \n\nSome [[Ethnology|ethnologists]], such as [[Robert Jaulin]], use the term \"ethnocide\" as a substitute for \"cultural genocide\",<ref>{{cite book |title=La paix blanche : introduction \u00e0 l'ethnocide |author=Robert Jaulin |authorlink=Robert Jaulin |publisher=\u00c9ditions du Seuil |year=1970 |language=French}}</ref> although this usage has been criticized as engendering a risk of confusing ethnicity with culture.<ref name=\"DelantyKumar2006\" /> The term was considered in the 2007 [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and juxtaposed next to the term \"[[ethnocide]].\" However, it was removed in the final document, and simply replaced with \"genocide\". \n\n==Usage==\nAs early as 1944, lawyer Raphael Lemkin distinguished a cultural component of genocide, which since then has become known as \"cultural genocide\".<ref name=\"AutoCK-1\"/> The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to actions that destroy cultural heritage and tradition. It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any form of destruction which the speaker disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such.\n\n===Proposed usage===\nThe drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but later dropped it from their consideration.<ref name=\"AbtahiWebb2008\"/><ref name=\"Davidson2012\"/><ref name=\"AutoCK-2\"/> The legal definition of [[genocide]] is unspecific about the exact way in which genocide is committed, only stating that it is destruction with the intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.<ref name=\"AutoCK-3\"/>\n\nArticle 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] used the phrase \"cultural genocide\" but did not define what it meant.<ref name=\"AutoCK-4\"/> The complete article in the draft read as follows:\n:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:\n::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;\n::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;\n::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;\n::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;\n::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.\n\nThis wording only appeared in a draft. The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions \"genocide, or any other act of violence\" in Article 7 (the only reference to genocide in the document).  The concept of \"ethnocide\" and \"cultural genocide\" was removed in the version adopted by the General Assembly, but the sub-points noted above from the draft were retained (with slightly expanded wording) in Article 8 that speaks to \"the right not to be subject to forced assimilation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf|title=United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples|publisher=United Nations|page=10|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In practice==\nCultural genocide involves the eradication and destruction of cultural artifacts, such as books, artworks, and structures, and the suppression of cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer's notion of what is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cultural Genocide, Stolen Lives: The Indigenous Peoples of Canada and the Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-7/cultural-genocide |website=Facing History and Ourselves |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref> Motives may include religious ones (e.g., [[iconoclasm]]), as part of a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to remove the evidence of a people from a specific locale or history, as part of an effort to implement a [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]], in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is \"reset\", the suppression of an indigenous culture by invaders and colonisers, along with many other potential reasons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Examples of the term's usage==\nThe term has been used to describe the destruction of [[cultural heritage]] in connection with various events:\n\n* The [[persecution of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] in [[Iran]] as a case of [[religious persecution]] has been called a cultural genocide.<ref name=\"AutoCK-13\"/><ref name=\"AutoCK-14\"/><ref>{{cite journal| last =Frelick | first = Bill | title =Iranian Baha'is and Genocide Early Warning| journal =Social Science Record | volume =24| issue =2| pages =35\u201337| date =Fall 1987 | language =\n | url =http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ362917 | accessdate = 2013-03-03 }}</ref>\n* In reference to the [[Axis powers]] (primarily, [[Nazi Germany]])'s policies towards some nations during [[World War II]] (ex.

It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any form of destruction which the speaker disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such.\n\n===Proposed usage===\nThe drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but later dropped it from their consideration.<ref name=\"AbtahiWebb2008\"/><ref name=\"Davidson2012\"/><ref name=\"AutoCK-2\"/> The legal definition of [[genocide]] is unspecific about the exact way in which genocide is committed, only stating that it is destruction with the intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.<ref name=\"AutoCK-3\"/>\n\nArticle 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] used the phrase \"cultural genocide\" but did not define what it meant.<ref name=\"AutoCK-4\"/> The complete article in the draft read as follows:\n:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:\n::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;\n::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;\n::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;\n::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;\n::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.\n\nThis wording only appeared in a draft. The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions \"genocide, or any other act of violence\" in Article 7 (the only reference to genocide in the document).

{"title_page": "Ostrogoths", "text_new": "[[File:Tomb of Theodoric the Great Ravenna (cropped).jpg|thumb|Upright=1.1|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe '''Ostrogoths''' ({{lang-la|Ostrogothi, Austrogothi}}) were a [[Roman-era]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]]. In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] with the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of their leader [[Theoderic Strabo]]. Instead Zeno backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had supported as its king. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. These comprise the earliest remnants of a [[Germanic language]].{{efn|A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}} }}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source. See: [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/39 p.39].}} In the 6th century, however, Jordanes believed that the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were two contrasting names simply meaning western and eastern Goths, respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=206}}\n\n==History==\n\n===The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi before the Huns===\n{{Further|Greuthungi}}\nThe nature of the divisions of the Goths before the arrival of the Huns is uncertain, but the Ostrogoths are only mentioned by that name very rarely and normally in very uncertain contexts. Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nA dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is sometimes mentioned in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), where the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is now known to have been made centuries later than the events it reports, and is not considered reliable.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5]. For commentary see {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|pp=24, 387fn52}}, {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} and {{harvtxt|Cameron|1993}}. Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}} In contrast, the [[Amal dynasty]], around whom the later and better-known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups who entered the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because into the 5th century they were Gothic leaders within [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}}\n\nAccording to Jordanes' ''Getica'' (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram believe that Jordanes was right to see continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nWolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these tribes before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400. In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} For example, there are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while other moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}}\n\nWhile many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in the 370s, apart from the Ostrogoths who were settled with Greuthungi in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed among some of the Goths who fought under [[Attila]] in the 5th century. This Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]]. The Ostrogoths thus fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nJordanes, in his ''Getica'', which is about the history of the Amals, claimed that the Amals were already preeminent under Attila, and among the Goths before the Huns. Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. The Ostrogoths under the Amal [[Valamir]] were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of Theoderic the Great.{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52-53}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib.

His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540.

In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list.

In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] with the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of their leader [[Theoderic Strabo]]. Instead Zeno backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had supported as its king. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. These comprise the earliest remnants of a [[Germanic language]].{{efn|A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}} }}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source. See: [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/39 p.39].}} In the 6th century, however, Jordanes believed that the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were two contrasting names simply meaning western and eastern Goths, respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=206}}\n\n==History==\n\n===The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi before the Huns===\n{{Further|Greuthungi}}\nThe nature of the divisions of the Goths before the arrival of the Huns is uncertain, but the Ostrogoths are only mentioned by that name very rarely and normally in very uncertain contexts. Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nA dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is sometimes mentioned in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), where the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is now known to have been made centuries later than the events it reports, and is not considered reliable.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5]. For commentary see {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|pp=24, 387fn52}}, {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}} and {{harvtxt|Cameron|1993}}. Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}} In contrast, the [[Amal dynasty]], around whom the later and better-known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups who entered the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because into the 5th century they were Gothic leaders within [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}}\n\nAccording to Jordanes' ''Getica'' (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram believe that Jordanes was right to see continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nWolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these tribes before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400. In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} For example, there are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while other moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}}\n\nWhile many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in the 370s, apart from the Ostrogoths who were settled with Greuthungi in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed among some of the Goths who fought under [[Attila]] in the 5th century. This Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]]. The Ostrogoths thus fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nJordanes, in his ''Getica'', which is about the history of the Amals, claimed that the Amals were already preeminent under Attila, and among the Goths before the Huns. Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. The Ostrogoths under the Amal [[Valamir]] were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of Theoderic the Great.{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52-53}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib. II., XLI. Luduin regi Francorum Theodericus rex}} was born to Theodemir in or about 454, soon after the Battle of Nedao. His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]]. The Goths seem to have been thick on the ground in northern Italy; in the south they formed little more than garrisons.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2,865}} Meanwhile, the Frankish king Clovis fought protracted wars against various enemies while consolidating his rule, forming the embryonic stages of what would eventually become Medieval Europe.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=116\u2013137}}\n\n===War with Byzantium (535\u2013554)===\n{{Main article|Gothic War (535\u2013554)}}\n\n[[File:Theodahad 534 536 Ostrogoth minted in Rome.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Theodahad]] (534-536), minted in [[Rome]] \u2013 he wears the barbaric [[moustache]].]]\n\nAbsent the unifying presence of Theodoric, the Ostrogoths and Visigoths were unable to consolidate their realms despite their common Germanic kinship. The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites. [[Theodahad]], cousin of Amalasuntha and nephew of Theodoric through his sister, took over and slew them;{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=332\u2013333, 337\u2013340}} however the usurping ushered in more bloodshed. Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540. This included the campaigns against the Ostrogoths, which is the subject of ''De Bello Gothico''.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list. Arne S\u00f8by Christensen, in his detailed analysis lists three possibilities:{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=250\u2013299}}\n*that Jordanes believed some Ostrogoths had emigrated north, or...\n*that a similar name \"Eastern Goths\" had been coined in Scandinavia, where there were a people with the related name, the [[Gauts]], or...\n*that a source of Jordanes, for example Cassiodorus, had created this form of the name, perhaps having heard of the Gauts.\n{{clr}}\n\nThere is some degree of surety that Jordanes penned the origin story based on oral tales, which are not necessarily reliable and so his efforts to put Gothic origins from Scandza into writing were undertaken to provide legitimacy to the tales, since Jordanes likely valued written over oral sources.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|pp=52\u201353}} Along similar lines, Jordanes recorded the genealogy of the Amal kings from oral sources.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=53\u201354}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 succeeded by his brother...\n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475 succeeded by his son...\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 succeeded by his grandson...\n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534 succeeded by his mother...\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535 the daughter of Theoderic, succeeded by her first cousin...\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536 the son of Theoderic's sister.\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].
