In 1884 he graduated from [[Williams College]], where he was a member of the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity.<ref>Baird, William Raymond (1915). ''[[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]]'', pp. 349\u2013355.</ref>\n\nBallinger passed the [[bar exam]] in 1886 and began practicing law in Seattle. He married Julia Albertson Bradley later that year, on October 26. The couple ultimately had two sons, (Edward Bradley Ballinger and Richard Talcott Ballinger).\n\nFollowing the scandal-prone [[Yukon Gold Rush]] era administration of [[Thomas J. Humes]], Ballinger was elected Seattle's mayor in 1904. With the support of the downtown business elite, he cracked down somewhat (but not heavily) on vice, and opposed [[labor unions]]. Ballinger later proved a roadblock to the city's strong [[municipal ownership]] movement.<ref>Berner, Richard C. (1991), ''Seattle 1900\u20131920: From Boomtown, Urban Turbulence, to Restoration'', Seattle: Charles Press, {{ISBN|0-9629889-0-1}}. p. 111.</ref> He also named [[Lake Ballinger]] in [[Snohomish County]] north of the city for his father, Col. Richard Ballinger.\n\n==Federal career and scandal==\n[[File:Ballinger Nomination.JPG|thumb|left|Ballinger's Secretary of the Interior nomination]]\nAfter serving as the mayor of Seattle, Ballinger joined the administration of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and served as commissioner of the [[General Land Office]] from 1907 until 1908. In 1909, Ballinger helped organize the [[Alaska\u2013Yukon\u2013Pacific Exposition]], a World's Fair to highlight development in the Northwest.\n\nIn 1909 despite previous promises to retain ex-President Roosevelt's cabinet officers, newly elected President [[William Howard Taft]] appointed Ballinger to replace conservationist (and fellow Ohioan) [[James R. Garfield]] as the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|U.S. Secretary of the Interior]].{{sfn|Goodwin|p=561-562}} One of his first acts was to revoke executive protection of lands potentially subject to development of hydroelectric energy pending surveys, restoring them to the public domain for leasing. Progressives feared that hydroelectric monopolies would grab such sites either to control or preclude development and would then dictate energy prices, since 13 companies (including [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]]) already controlled more than a third of waterpower resources as Roosevelt left office. However, that restoration soon provoked a scandal. In August, in conjunction with the National Irrigation Conference in [[Spokane, Washington]], a [[United Press International|United Press]] reporter published a story about 15,868 acres of land in Montana being sold to large corporations (General Electric, [[Asarco|Guggenheim]] and [[Amalgamated Copper]]). Ballinger at first ignored the story, then accused reporters of opposing development in the West.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=606-610}} Although that Montana waterpower story proved to be overblown, accusations of favoritism continued to dog Ballinger as Secretary of the Interior.\n\nThe most serious charges involved [[coal]] development in the [[Chugach National Forest]] by a Seattle developer and Ballinger crony, [[Charles Cunningham|Clarence Cunningham]], and financed by a corporation associated with [[J. P. Morgan]] and the [[Guggenheim family]] of New York City. The group had staked 33 claims, although [[Alaska]] land laws were designed to foster small farmers and prevent monopoly and thus required each claimant to prove that he or she was acting on his or her own behalf, as well as limited each claimant to 160 acres. While land commissioner, Ballinger granted the developer special access to government files. During the several month gap in 1908 between his employment as land commissioner and interior secretary, Ballinger acted as an agent for the Cunningham/Morgan/Guggenheim development group with the federal government, lobbying then Interior Secretary [[James Rudolph Garfield|Jim Garfield]]. Upon becoming Interior Secretary, Ballinger reassigned General Land Office investigator Louis R. Glavis, and ultimately fired him after he complained to [[Gifford Pinchot]] (head of the [[U.S. Forest Service|Forestry Bureau]] and thus responsible for the Chugach, although also subordinate to the Interior Secretary), President Taft and cooperated with the press.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=610-614}}\n\nA series of [[muckraking]] articles, including Glavis' in the November issue of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' roused the [[Conservation ethic|conservationists]]. An article in ''Hampton's'' even accused President Taft of being part of a conspiracy hatched at the 1908 Republican Convention. Ballinger again dismissed the controversy and President Taft appeared to want the ordeal to end, maintaining that both Ballinger and Pinchot remained committed to Roosevelt's conservation policies. Ballinger, however, threatened to resign unless Taft consented to a congressional investigation to exonerate him, and in December sent a letter to Washington state's Republican senator [[Wesley Jones]] demanding a complete investigation.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=616-618}}\n\nAlthough even [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charles Taft]] advised the President to ask for Ballinger's resignation, Taft stood by his appointee, and attorney general [[George Wickersham]] even backdated to September 11, 1909 a report concerning Glavis' firing. After a Washington insider warned Collier that Ballinger planned to sue his magazine after the planned \"whitewash\", it hired [[Louis D. Brandeis]] as its counsel. Pinchot went public with his differences with Ballinger's approach and his office delivered another report to the Senator Dolliver, Republican chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. This prompted Taft to fire Pinchot as well, while Roosevelt was in Africa.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=619-621}} During the special committee's hearings, both Glavis and Pinchot testified, and testimony about the backdating by a stenographer prompted Taft to take responsibility for ordering it, though that stenographer and other employees were also fired. Brandeis' questioning made Ballinger's anti-conservationism clear, but did not unearth anything so serious as to warrant criminal charges.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=622-626}} Nonetheless, public confidence in Ballinger's leadership of the Interior Department had waned.\n\nAfter the Republican party lost heavily in the midterm elections that November, Ballinger finally resigned on March 12, 1911. Taft had replaced Pinchot with [[Henry S. Graves|Henry Graves]], who was committed to protecting American forests, and Ballinger helped Taft to secure a new law which allowed Taft to withdraw public lands from private development, thus allowing them to protect as many acres in one term as Roosevelt had in nearly two terms.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=627}} However, the series of Ballinger-related scandals, Taft's loyalty to his embattled appointee, and Ballinger's refusal to resign for more than nine additional months\u2014combined with controversy over the [[Payne\u2013Aldrich tariff]]\u2014split the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and helped to turn the tide of the 1912 election against Taft.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Seattle - Richard A. Ballinger House 01.jpg|thumb|Richard A. Ballinger House in Seattle, Washington]]\nBallinger returned to the private practice of law in [[Seattle, Washington]], where he died on June 6, 1922, and was buried at the Lake View Cemetery.<ref>[https://myedmondsnews.com/2019/01/looking-back-mountlake-terrace-and-the-ballinger-story/ My Edmonds News]</ref>\n\nHis wife Julia Albertson Ballinger (1864-1961) bore their sons Edwin B.

In 1884 he graduated from [[Williams College]], where he was a member of the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity.<ref>Baird, William Raymond (1915). ''[[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]]'', pp. 349\u2013355.</ref>\n\nBallinger passed the [[bar exam]] in 1886 and began practicing law in Seattle. He married Julia Albertson Bradley later that year, on October 26. The couple ultimately had two sons, (Edward Bradley Ballinger and Richard Talcott Ballinger).\n\nFollowing the scandal-prone [[Yukon Gold Rush]] era administration of [[Thomas J. Humes]], Ballinger was elected Seattle's mayor in 1904. With the support of the downtown business elite, he cracked down somewhat (but not heavily) on vice, and opposed [[labor unions]]. Ballinger later proved a roadblock to the city's strong [[municipal ownership]] movement.<ref>Berner, Richard C. (1991), ''Seattle 1900\u20131920: From Boomtown, Urban Turbulence, to Restoration'', Seattle: Charles Press, {{ISBN|0-9629889-0-1}}. p. 111.</ref> He also named [[Lake Ballinger]] in [[Snohomish County]] north of the city for his father, Col. Richard Ballinger.\n\n==Federal career and scandal==\n[[File:Ballinger Nomination.JPG|thumb|left|Ballinger's Secretary of the Interior nomination]]\nAfter serving as the mayor of Seattle, Ballinger joined the administration of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and served as commissioner of the [[General Land Office]] from 1907 until 1908. In 1909, Ballinger helped organize the [[Alaska\u2013Yukon\u2013Pacific Exposition]], a World's Fair to highlight development in the Northwest.\n\nIn 1909 despite previous promises to retain ex-President Roosevelt's cabinet officers, newly elected President [[William Howard Taft]] appointed Ballinger to replace conservationist (and fellow Ohioan) [[James R. Garfield]] as the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|U.S. Secretary of the Interior]].{{sfn|Goodwin|p=561-562}} One of his first acts was to revoke executive protection of lands potentially subject to development of hydroelectric energy pending surveys, restoring them to the public domain for leasing. Progressives feared that hydroelectric monopolies would grab such sites either to control or preclude development and would then dictate energy prices, since 13 companies (including [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]]) already controlled more than a third of waterpower resources as Roosevelt left office. However, that restoration soon provoked a scandal. In August, in conjunction with the National Irrigation Conference in [[Spokane, Washington]], a [[United Press International|United Press]] reporter published a story about 15,868 acres of land in Montana being sold to large corporations (General Electric, [[Asarco|Guggenheim]] and [[Amalgamated Copper]]). Ballinger at first ignored the story, then accused reporters of opposing development in the West.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=606-610}} Although that Montana waterpower story proved to be overblown, accusations of favoritism continued to dog Ballinger as Secretary of the Interior.\n\nThe most serious charges involved [[coal]] development in the [[Chugach National Forest]] by a Seattle developer and Ballinger crony, [[Charles Cunningham|Clarence Cunningham]], and financed by a corporation associated with [[J. P. Morgan]] and the [[Guggenheim family]] of New York City. The group had staked 33 claims, although [[Alaska]] land laws were designed to foster small farmers and prevent monopoly and thus required each claimant to prove that he or she was acting on his or her own behalf, as well as limited each claimant to 160 acres. While land commissioner, Ballinger granted the developer special access to government files. During the several month gap in 1908 between his employment as land commissioner and interior secretary, Ballinger acted as an agent for the Cunningham/Morgan/Guggenheim development group with the federal government, lobbying then Interior Secretary [[James Rudolph Garfield|Jim Garfield]]. Upon becoming Interior Secretary, Ballinger reassigned General Land Office investigator Louis R. Glavis, and ultimately fired him after he complained to [[Gifford Pinchot]] (head of the [[U.S. Forest Service|Forestry Bureau]] and thus responsible for the Chugach, although also subordinate to the Interior Secretary), President Taft and cooperated with the press.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=610-614}}\n\nA series of [[muckraking]] articles, including Glavis' in the November issue of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' roused the [[Conservation ethic|conservationists]]. An article in ''Hampton's'' even accused President Taft of being part of a conspiracy hatched at the 1908 Republican Convention. Ballinger again dismissed the controversy and President Taft appeared to want the ordeal to end, maintaining that both Ballinger and Pinchot remained committed to Roosevelt's conservation policies. Ballinger, however, threatened to resign unless Taft consented to a congressional investigation to exonerate him, and in December sent a letter to Washington state's Republican senator [[Wesley Jones]] demanding a complete investigation.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=616-618}}\n\nAlthough even [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charles Taft]] advised the President to ask for Ballinger's resignation, Taft stood by his appointee, and attorney general [[George Wickersham]] even backdated to September 11, 1909 a report concerning Glavis' firing. After a Washington insider warned Collier that Ballinger planned to sue his magazine after the planned \"whitewash\", it hired [[Louis D. Brandeis]] as its counsel. Pinchot went public with his differences with Ballinger's approach and his office delivered another report to the Senator Dolliver, Republican chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. This prompted Taft to fire Pinchot as well, while Roosevelt was in Africa.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=619-621}} During the special committee's hearings, both Glavis and Pinchot testified, and testimony about the backdating by a stenographer prompted Taft to take responsibility for ordering it, though that stenographer and other employees were also fired. Brandeis' questioning made Ballinger's anti-conservationism clear, but did not unearth anything so serious as to warrant criminal charges.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=622-626}} Nonetheless, public confidence in Ballinger's leadership of the Interior Department had waned.\n\nAfter the Republican party lost heavily in the midterm elections that November, Ballinger finally resigned on March 12, 1911. Taft had replaced Pinchot with [[Henry S. Graves|Henry Graves]], who was committed to protecting American forests, and Ballinger helped Taft to secure a new law which allowed Taft to withdraw public lands from private development, thus allowing them to protect as many acres in one term as Roosevelt had in nearly two terms.{{sfn|Goodwin|p=627}} However, the series of Ballinger-related scandals, Taft's loyalty to his embattled appointee, and Ballinger's refusal to resign for more than nine additional months\u2014combined with controversy over the [[Payne\u2013Aldrich tariff]]\u2014split the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and helped to turn the tide of the 1912 election against Taft.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Seattle - Richard A. Ballinger House 01.jpg|thumb|Richard A. Ballinger House in Seattle, Washington]]\nBallinger returned to the private practice of law in [[Seattle, Washington]], where he died on June 6, 1922, and was buried at the Lake View Cemetery.<ref>[https://myedmondsnews.com/2019/01/looking-back-mountlake-terrace-and-the-ballinger-story/ My Edmonds News]</ref>\n\nHis wife Julia Albertson Ballinger (1864-1961) bore their sons Edwin B.
