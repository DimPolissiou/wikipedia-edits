In the 2002\u20132003 season, Malone passed [[Wilt Chamberlain]] for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points. He became a free agent in 2003, the year Stockton had retired. For the time Malone and [[point guard]] [[John Stockton]] played together on the Jazz (1984\u20132003), the two formed one of the most productive guard\u2013forward combinations in NBA history. Playing coach [[Jerry Sloan]]'s scrappy and tough style and perfecting the [[pick and roll]] to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record.

Malone returned by the season's end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs. In the first round against the [[Houston Rockets]], Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against [[Tim Duncan]], despite not scoring more than 13 points during the series. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals.

He was a physical defender and rebounder, and one of the most durable players ever in the NBA. He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a [[triple-double]] and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA, when he raised his [[free throw]] shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.\n\nMalone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore [[11 (number)|number 11]] for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone refused) and also for the Dream Team (the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to [[FIBA]] rules). Malone was photographed with a number 32 jersey at his Lakers introductory press conference.\n\nOver 1,476 NBA games (fourth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), second-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high [[field goal percentage]] benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton. Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|record=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1985}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 76 || 30.6 || .496 || .000 || .481 || 8.9 || 2.9 || 1.3 || 0.5 || 14.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1986}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1986\u201387 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 34.8 || .512 || .000 || .598 || 10.4 || 1.9 || 1.3 || 0.7 || 21.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1987}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1987\u201388 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 39.0 || .520 || .000 || .700 || '''12.0''' || 2.4 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1988}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1988\u201389 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 39.0 || .519 || .313 || .766 || 10.7 || 2.7 || 1.8 || 0.9 || 29.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1989}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1989\u201390 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 38.1 || '''.562''' || .372 || .762 || 11.1 || 2.8 || 1.5 || 0.6 || '''31.0'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1990}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1990\u201391 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 40.3 || .527 || .286 || .770 || 11.8 || 3.3 || 1.1 || 1.0 || 29.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1991}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1991\u201392 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 37.7 || .526 || .176 || .778 || 11.2 || 3.0 || 1.3 || 0.6 || 28.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1992}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1992\u201393 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 37.8 || .552 || .200 || .740 || 11.2 || 3.8 || 1.5 || 1.0 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1993}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1993\u201394 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || '''40.6''' || .497 || .250 || .694 || 11.5 || 4.0 || 1.5 || '''1.5''' || 25.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1994}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1994\u201395 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82'''||'''82''' || 38.1 || .536 || .268 || .742 || 10.6 || 3.5 || 1.6 || 1.0 || 26.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1995}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1995\u201396 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 38.0 || .519 || '''.400''' || .723 || 9.8 || 4.2 || 1.7 || 0.7 || 25.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1996}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1996\u201397 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 36.6 || .550 || .000 || .755 || 9.9 || 4.5 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 27.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1997}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1997\u201398 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 37.4 || .530 || .333 || .761 || 10.3 || 3.9 || 1.2 || 0.9 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1998}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1998\u201399 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 49 || 49 || 37.4 || .493 || .000 || .788 || 9.4 || 4.1 || 1.3 || 0.6 || 23.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1999|trunc=y}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1999\u201300 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 35.9 || .509 || .250 || '''.797''' || 9.5 || 3.7 || 1.0 || 0.9 || 25.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2000}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2000\u201301 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 35.7 || .498 || '''.400''' || .793 || 8.3 || 4.5 || 1.1 || 0.8 || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2001}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2001\u201302 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 80 || 80 || 38.0 || .454 || .360 || '''.797''' || 8.6 || 4.3 || '''1.9''' || 0.7 || 22.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2002}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2002\u201303 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 36.2 || .462 || .214 || .763 || 7.8 || '''4.7''' || 1.7 || 0.4 || 20.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2003}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2003\u201304 Los Angeles Lakers season|L.A.

The paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One item listed was a laboratory blood test that concluded with over 99% certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying the same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone.<ref name=Tribune>Fantin, Linda.

In the first round against the [[Houston Rockets]], Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against [[Tim Duncan]], despite not scoring more than 13 points during the series. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals.

He was a physical defender and rebounder, and one of the most durable players ever in the NBA. He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a [[triple-double]] and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA, when he raised his [[free throw]] shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.\n\nMalone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore [[11 (number)|number 11]] for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone refused) and also for the Dream Team (the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to [[FIBA]] rules). Malone was photographed with a number 32 jersey at his Lakers introductory press conference.\n\nOver 1,476 NBA games (fourth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), second-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high [[field goal percentage]] benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton. Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|record=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1985}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 76 || 30.6 || .496 || .000 || .481 || 8.9 || 2.9 || 1.3 || 0.5 || 14.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1986}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1986\u201387 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 34.8 || .512 || .000 || .598 || 10.4 || 1.9 || 1.3 || 0.7 || 21.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1987}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1987\u201388 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 39.0 || .520 || .000 || .700 || '''12.0''' || 2.4 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1988}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1988\u201389 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 39.0 || .519 || .313 || .766 || 10.7 || 2.7 || 1.8 || 0.9 || 29.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1989}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1989\u201390 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 38.1 || '''.562''' || .372 || .762 || 11.1 || 2.8 || 1.5 || 0.6 || '''31.0'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1990}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1990\u201391 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 40.3 || .527 || .286 || .770 || 11.8 || 3.3 || 1.1 || 1.0 || 29.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1991}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1991\u201392 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 37.7 || .526 || .176 || .778 || 11.2 || 3.0 || 1.3 || 0.6 || 28.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1992}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1992\u201393 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 37.8 || .552 || .200 || .740 || 11.2 || 3.8 || 1.5 || 1.0 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1993}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1993\u201394 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || '''40.6''' || .497 || .250 || .694 || 11.5 || 4.0 || 1.5 || '''1.5''' || 25.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1994}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1994\u201395 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82'''||'''82''' || 38.1 || .536 || .268 || .742 || 10.6 || 3.5 || 1.6 || 1.0 || 26.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1995}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1995\u201396 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 38.0 || .519 || '''.400''' || .723 || 9.8 || 4.2 || 1.7 || 0.7 || 25.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1996}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1996\u201397 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 36.6 || .550 || .000 || .755 || 9.9 || 4.5 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 27.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1997}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1997\u201398 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 37.4 || .530 || .333 || .761 || 10.3 || 3.9 || 1.2 || 0.9 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1998}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1998\u201399 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 49 || 49 || 37.4 || .493 || .000 || .788 || 9.4 || 4.1 || 1.3 || 0.6 || 23.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|1999|trunc=y}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1999\u201300 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| '''82''' || '''82''' || 35.9 || .509 || .250 || '''.797''' || 9.5 || 3.7 || 1.0 || 0.9 || 25.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2000}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2000\u201301 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 35.7 || .498 || '''.400''' || .793 || 8.3 || 4.5 || 1.1 || 0.8 || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2001}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2001\u201302 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 80 || 80 || 38.0 || .454 || .360 || '''.797''' || 8.6 || 4.3 || '''1.9''' || 0.7 || 22.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2002}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2002\u201303 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 81 || 81 || 36.2 || .462 || .214 || .763 || 7.8 || '''4.7''' || 1.7 || 0.4 || 20.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{nbay|2003}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[2003\u201304 Los Angeles Lakers season|L.A.

Malone and Ford were both 17 when twins Daryl and [[Cheryl Ford]] were born;<ref>{{cite news|title=Malone Paternity Revealed|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-23/sports/25738724_1_karl-malone-cheryl-and-daryl-bonita-ford|accessdate=June 24, 2011|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 23, 1998}}</ref> Malone was a 20-year-old college sophomore when Bell, at age 13, gave birth to [[Demetress Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jemele|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hill/080507|title=Karl Malone falls short, as a father|work=Page 2|publisher=ESPN|date=May 12, 2008|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref> In the aftermath of the ''Globe'' story, Malone met the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born.<ref name=\"meets twins\">{{cite news|title=Malone finally meets twins who call him `Dad'|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/638070/Malone-finally-meets-twins-who-call-him-Dad.html|newspaper=Deseret News|date=June 26, 1998|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and his attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits before any conclusive establishment of paternity and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.\n\nThe ''Tribune'' confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. The paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One item listed was a laboratory blood test that concluded with over 99% certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying the same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone.<ref name=Tribune>Fantin, Linda.

Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case of the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]]. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.<ref name=Tribune />\n\nBy the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone said publicly that the twins were members of the Malone family.<ref name=Tribune3>Siegel, Lee.

In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists had predicted, but thus far no convincing explanation has been found.

While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.

The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter.

While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.<ref name=\"GAL2\">{{cite journal |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J.

The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter.

Flynn played alcoholic sports reporter Frank Medlin, who sweeps Louise Elliott ( [[Bette Davis]]) off her feet on a visit to Silver Bow, Montana. Their married life in San Francisco is difficult, an Frank sails to Singapore just hours before the catastrophe. The original ending of the film was the same as the book: Louise married a character named William Benson. But preview audiences disliked that ending, and a new one was filmed in which Frank comes to Silver Bow to find her and they reconcile. Apparently audiences wanted Errol Flynn to get the girl, or vice versa.

Flynn and co-stars [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[David Niven]] led a cast that was all male and predominantly British. Director [[Edmund Goulding]]'s biographer [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] wrote: \u201cEveryone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer.... The filming of ''Dawn Patrol'' was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of humor.... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the beautiful English manners of the cutterups. The expressions of polite and pained shock on the faces of Niven, Flynn, Rathbone et al., when (women) visitors were embarrassed was the best part of the nonsense.\u201d<ref>Kennedy, Matthew.

Flynn played Union officer Kerry Bradford. \n\nIn an article for TCM, Jeremy Arnold wrote: \"Ironically, the Randolph Scott role [as Captain Vance Irby, commandant of the prison camp where Bradford was a prisoner of war] was originally conceived for Flynn.... In fact, ''Virginia City'' was plagued with script, production and personnel problems all along. Shooting began without a finished script, angering Flynn, who complained unsuccessfully to the studio about it. Flynn disliked the temperamental Curtiz and tried to have him removed from the film. Curtiz didn't like Flynn (or costar Miriam Hopkins) either. And Humphrey Bogart apparently didn't care for Flynn or Randolph Scott! Making matters worse was the steady rain that fell for two of the three weeks of location shooting near Flagstaff, AZ. Flynn detested rain, and was physically unwell for quite some time because of it. As Peter Valenti has written, 'Errol's frustration at the role can be easily understood: he changed from antagonist to protagonist, from Southern to Northern officer, almost as the film was being shot. [This] intensified Errol's feelings of inadequacy as a performer and his contempt for studio operation.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=333905%7C33915|title=TCM Film Article Virginia City|last=Arnold|first=Jeremy|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref> Despite the troubles behind the scenes, the film was a huge success, making a profit of just under $1 million. \n\nFlynn\u2019s next film had been planned since 1936: another swashbuckler taken from a Sabatini novel, ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940). However, in the end, only the title was used, and a completely different story was created. \n\nA reviewer observed in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] Aug. 19, 1940, \"''The Sea Hawk'' (Warner) is 1940's lustiest assault on the double feature.

Produced by Warner's Hal Wallis with a splendor that would set parsimonious Queen Bess's teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-&-true cinema materials available, ''The Sea Hawk'' is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish [sic] Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood.

In ''[[The Two Lives of Errol Flynn]]'' by [[Michael Freedland]], Alexis Smith told of taking the star aside: \"'It's so silly, working all day and then playing all night and dissipating yourself.

He then made a film for his own production company, Thomson Productions, where he had a say in the choice of vehicle, director and cast, plus a portion of the profits. This picture had a modest gross of $1.5 million. ''[[Uncertain Glory]]'' (1944) was a war-time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself. However, it was not a success and Thomson Productions made no more movies.

Although popular, it was withdrawn in Britain after protests that the role played by British troops was not given sufficient credit.<ref>Basinger (2009), p. 248.</ref> A Western, ''[[San Antonio (film)|San Antonio]]'' (1945), was also very popular, grossing $3.553 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' third-biggest hit of the year.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Post-war career===\nFlynn tried comedy again with ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1946 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' (1946), a comedy of remarriage opposite [[Eleanor Parker]], but it was not a success, grossing $1.77 million in the U.S. In 1946, Flynn published an adventure novel, ''[[Showdown (Flynn novel)|Showdown]]'', and earned a reported [[$]]184,000 ({{Inflation|US|184000|1946|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).<ref>\"M'CAREY'S WAGE OF $1,113,035 YEAR'S HIGHEST: Treasury Report Places Film Producer First\", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (1923-1963)[Chicago, Illinois], 17 June 1946, pg. 6.</ref>\n\n''[[Cry Wolf (1947 film)|Cry Wolf]]'' (1947) was a thriller with Flynn in a seemingly more villainous role. It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, ''[[Escape Me Never (1947 film)|Escape Me Never]]'' (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money. More popular was a Western with Walsh and [[Ann Sheridan]], ''[[Silver River (film)|Silver River]]'' (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable. Flynn drank so heavily on the set that he was effectively disabled after noon, and a disgusted Walsh terminated their business relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/silverriver.htm|title=silverriver|website=homepages.sover.net}}</ref>\n\nWarners tried returning Flynn to swashbucklers and the result was ''[[Adventures of Don Juan]]'' (1948). The film was very successful in Europe, grossing $3.1 million, but less so in the U.S., with $1.9, and struggled to recoup its large budget. Still, it was Warner Bros.' 4th-biggest hit of the year. From this point on, Warner Bros. reduced the budgets of Flynn's films. In November 1947 Flynn signed a 15-year contract with [[Warner Bros.]] for $225,000 per film.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety168-1947-12#page/n195/mode/1up \"Flynn's Fancy WB Pact\"], ''Variety'', December 1947; retrieved 22 March 2016.</ref> His income totaled $214,000 that year,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-02#page/n195/mode/1up|title=Variety (February 1948)|website=Archive.org|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> and $200,000 in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-02#page/n69/mode/2up|title=Variety (February 1949)|website=Archive.org|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Later Warner films===\n[[File:Errol Flynn in That Forsyte Woman.JPG|thumb|Flynn in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949)]]\nAfter a cameo in Warner Bros.' ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), Flynn was borrowed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to appear in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949) which made $1.855 million in the U.S. and $1.842 million abroad which was the 11th-biggest hit of the year for MGM. He went on a three-month holiday then made two medium budget Westerns for Warners, ''[[Montana (1950 film)|Montana]]'' (1950), which made $2.1 million and was Warner Bros.' 5th-biggest movie of the year, and ''[[Rocky Mountain (film)|Rocky Mountain]]'' (1950), which made $1.7 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' 9th-biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for ''[[Kim (1950 film)|Kim]]'' (1950), one of Flynn's most popular movies from this period, grossing $5.348 million ($2.896 million in the U.S. plus $2.452 million abroad) making it MGM's 5th-biggest movie of the year and 11th biggest overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home he shot some scenes for a film he produced, ''[[Hello God]]'' (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released. For many years this was considered a lost film, but in 2013 a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie had deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and are at the George Eastman House film archive for restoration.\n\nFlynn wrote and co-produced his next film, the low-budget ''[[Adventures of Captain Fabian]]'' (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France. (Flynn wrote articles, novels and scripts but never had the discipline to turn it into a full time career.<ref>{{cite web|website=Filmink|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|title=Ten Stories About Australian Screenwriters You Might Not Know|date=September 29, 2019|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/ten-stories-australian-screenwriters-might-not-know/}}</ref>) Flynn wound up suing Marshall in court over both movies. \n\nFor Warners he appeared in an adventure tale set in the Philippines, ''[[Mara Maru]]'' (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, ''[[Cruise of the Zaca]]'' (1952). In August 1951 he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal, in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was ''[[Against All Flags]]'' (1952), a popular swashbuckler. As early as 1952 he had been seriously ill with [[hepatitis]] resulting in liver damage.<ref>Flynn, Errol ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'' (1959), p. 14</ref> In England, he made another swashbuckler for Warners, ''[[The Master of Ballantrae (1953 film)|The Master of Ballantrae]]'' (1953).

He made a swashbuckler in Italy, ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in that country, ''[[The Story of William Tell]]'' (1954), directed by [[Jack Cardiff]] with Flynn in the title role. The movie fell apart during production and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from [[Herbert Wilcox]] to support [[Anna Neagle]] in a British musical, ''[[Lilacs in the Spring]]'' (1954). Also shot in Britain was ''[[The Dark Avenger]]'' (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Wilcox used him with Neagle again, in ''[[King's Rhapsody (film)|King's Rhapsody]]'' (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television [[anthology series]] ''The Errol Flynn Theatre'' that was filmed in [[UK|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hollywood comeback===\nFlynn received an offer to make his first Hollywood film in five years: ''[[Istanbul (film)|Istanbul]]'' (1957), for Universal. He made a thriller shot in Cuba, ''[[The Big Boodle]]'' (1957), then had his best role in a long time in the blockbuster ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) for producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] which made $3 million in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nFlynn's performance in the latter was well received and led to a series of roles where he played drunks. Warner Bros. cast him as [[John Barrymore]] in ''[[Too Much, Too Soon]]'' (1958), and Zanuck used him again in ''[[The Roots of Heaven (film)|The Roots of Heaven]]'' which made $3 million (1958).

actor during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]]. Considered the natural successor to [[Douglas Fairbanks]], he achieved worldwide fame for his romantic [[swashbuckler]] roles in Hollywood films, as well as frequent partnerships with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. He was best known for his role as [[Robin Hood]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938); his portrayal of the character was named by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|18th-greatest hero in American film history]].

According to Faulkner's student, Tex Allen, \u201cFaulkner had good material to work with. Veteran Basil Rathbone was a good fencer already, and Flynn, though new to the school of fence, was athletic and a quick learner. Under Faulkner's choreography Rathbone and Flynn made the swordplay look good. For the next two decades Faulkner's movie list as fencing double and choreographer reads as a history of Hollywood's golden years of adventure yarns [including Flynn's] [[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]] (1940),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269110/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm|title=Ralph Faulkner (1891\u20131987)|website=IMDB}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' did little to convince the studio that their prize swashbuckler should be allowed to do other things, but Warners allowed Flynn to try a [[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]], ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938). Despite the presence of de Havilland and direction of Curtiz, it was not a success. ''[[The Sisters (1938 film)|The Sisters]]'' (1938) a drama showing the lives of three sisters in the years from 1904 to 1908, including a dramatic rendering of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, was more popular. Flynn played alcoholic sports reporter Frank Medlin, who sweeps Louise Elliott ( [[Bette Davis]]) off her feet on a visit to Silver Bow, Montana. Their married life in San Francisco is difficult, an Frank sails to Singapore just hours before the catastrophe. The original ending of the film was the same as the book: Louise married a character named William Benson. But preview audiences disliked that ending, and a new one was filmed in which Frank comes to Silver Bow to find her and they reconcile. Apparently audiences wanted Errol Flynn to get the girl, or vice versa. (Bette Davis preferred the original ending.)<ref>Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, ''Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis''.

Flynn and co-stars [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[David Niven]] led a cast that was all male and predominantly British. Director [[Edmund Goulding]]'s biographer [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] wrote: \u201cEveryone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer.... The filming of ''Dawn Patrol'' was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of humor.... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the beautiful English manners of the cutterups. The expressions of polite and pained shock on the faces of Niven, Flynn, Rathbone et al., when (women) visitors were embarrassed was the best part of the nonsense.\u201d<ref>Kennedy, Matthew.

Flynn's relationship with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene.

Paladin (2010), pp. 186-87; {{ISBN|097116858X}}.</ref>\n\nWarners put Flynn in another Western, ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), set near the end of the Civil War. Flynn played Union officer Kerry Bradford. \n\nIn an article for TCM, Jeremy Arnold wrote: \"Ironically, the Randolph Scott role [as Captain Vance Irby, commandant of the prison camp where Bradford was a prisoner of war] was originally conceived for Flynn.... In fact, ''Virginia City'' was plagued with script, production and personnel problems all along. Shooting began without a finished script, angering Flynn, who complained unsuccessfully to the studio about it. Flynn disliked the temperamental Curtiz and tried to have him removed from the film. Curtiz didn't like Flynn (or costar Miriam Hopkins) either. And Humphrey Bogart apparently didn't care for Flynn or Randolph Scott! Making matters worse was the steady rain that fell for two of the three weeks of location shooting near Flagstaff, AZ. Flynn detested rain, and was physically unwell for quite some time because of it. As Peter Valenti has written, 'Errol's frustration at the role can be easily understood: he changed from antagonist to protagonist, from Southern to Northern officer, almost as the film was being shot. [This] intensified Errol's feelings of inadequacy as a performer and his contempt for studio operation.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=333905%7C33915|title=TCM Film Article Virginia City|last=Arnold|first=Jeremy|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref> Despite the troubles behind the scenes, the film was a huge success, making a profit of just under $1 million. \n\nFlynn\u2019s next film had been planned since 1936: another swashbuckler taken from a Sabatini novel, ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940). However, in the end, only the title was used, and a completely different story was created. \n\nA reviewer observed in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] Aug. 19, 1940, \"''The Sea Hawk'' (Warner) is 1940's lustiest assault on the double feature. It cost $1,700,000, exhibits Errol Flynn and 3,000 other cinemactors performing every imaginable feat of spectacular derring-do, and lasts two hours and seven minutes.... Produced by Warner's Hal Wallis with a splendor that would set parsimonious Queen Bess's teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-&-true cinema materials available, ''The Sea Hawk'' is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish [sic] Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood.

This picture had a modest gross of $1.5 million. ''[[Uncertain Glory]]'' (1944) was a war-time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself.

It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, ''[[Escape Me Never (1947 film)|Escape Me Never]]'' (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money. More popular was a Western with Walsh and [[Ann Sheridan]], ''[[Silver River (film)|Silver River]]'' (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable.

''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), Flynn was borrowed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to appear in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949) which made $1.855 million in the U.S. and $1.842 million abroad which was the 11th-biggest hit of the year for MGM. He went on a three-month holiday then made two medium budget Westerns for Warners, ''[[Montana (1950 film)|Montana]]'' (1950), which made $2.1 million and was Warner Bros.' 5th-biggest movie of the year, and ''[[Rocky Mountain (film)|Rocky Mountain]]'' (1950), which made $1.7 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' 9th-biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for ''[[Kim (1950 film)|Kim]]'' (1950), one of Flynn's most popular movies from this period, grossing $5.348 million ($2.896 million in the U.S. plus $2.452 million abroad) making it MGM's 5th-biggest movie of the year and 11th biggest overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home he shot some scenes for a film he produced, ''[[Hello God]]'' (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released. For many years this was considered a lost film, but in 2013 a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie had deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and are at the George Eastman House film archive for restoration.\n\nFlynn wrote and co-produced his next film, the low-budget ''[[Adventures of Captain Fabian]]'' (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France.

That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, ''[[Cruise of the Zaca]]'' (1952). In August 1951 he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal, in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was ''[[Against All Flags]]'' (1952), a popular swashbuckler.

He made a swashbuckler in Italy, ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in that country, ''[[The Story of William Tell]]'' (1954), directed by [[Jack Cardiff]] with Flynn in the title role. The movie fell apart during production and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from [[Herbert Wilcox]] to support [[Anna Neagle]] in a British musical, ''[[Lilacs in the Spring]]'' (1954). Also shot in Britain was ''[[The Dark Avenger]]'' (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Wilcox used him with Neagle again, in ''[[King's Rhapsody (film)|King's Rhapsody]]'' (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations.
