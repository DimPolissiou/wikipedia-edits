Branches in the program code do not affect performance significantly, provided that each of 32 threads takes the same execution path; the [[SIMD]] execution model becomes a significant limitation for any inherently divergent task (e.g. traversing a [[space partitioning]] data structure during [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]).\n* Unlike [[OpenCL]], CUDA-enabled GPUs are only available from Nvidia.<ref name=\"CUDA_products\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html |title=CUDA-Enabled Products |work=CUDA Zone |publisher=Nvidia Corporation |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>\n* No emulator or fallback functionality is available for modern revisions.\n* Valid C++ may sometimes be flagged and prevent compilation due to the way the compiler approaches optimization for target GPU device limitations.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n* C++ [[run-time type information]] (RTTI) and C++-style exception handling are only supported in host code, not in device code.\n* In [[Single precision floating-point format|single precision]] on first generation CUDA compute capability 1.x devices, [[denormal number]]s are unsupported and are instead flushed to zero, and the precisions of the division and square root operations are slightly lower than IEEE 754-compliant single precision math. Devices that support compute capability 2.0 and above support denormal numbers, and the division and square root operations are IEEE 754 compliant by default. However, users can obtain the prior faster gaming-grade math of compute capability 1.x devices if desired by setting compiler flags to disable accurate divisions and accurate square roots, and enable flushing denormal numbers to zero.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/cuda/files/NVIDIA-CUDA-Floating-Point.pdf |first1=Nathan |last1=Whitehead |first2=Alex |last2=Fit-Florea |title=Precision & Performance: Floating Point and IEEE 754 Compliance for Nvidia GPUs |accessdate=November 18, 2014 |publisher=[[Nvidia]]}}</ref>\n\n==GPUs supported==\nSupported CUDA level of GPU and card.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 21st film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. [[Nicole Perlman]] and [[Meg LeFauve]] were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and became the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is in development, scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. [[Nicole Perlman]] and [[Meg LeFauve]] were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and became the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is in development, scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

She described the friendship between Danvers and Rambeau as equal, with \"a playful competitiveness [and a] mutual respect\".<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /> Like Larson, Lynch met with active duty airmen in preparation for the role. In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the sequel to 2015's ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 20th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Peyton Reed]] and written by the writing teams of [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and [[Erik Sommers]], and [[Paul Rudd]], Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. It stars Rudd as Lang and [[Evangeline Lilly]] as Van Dyne, alongside [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Judy Greer]], [[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[David Dastmalchian]], [[Hannah John-Kamen]], [[Abby Ryder Fortson]], [[Randall Park]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Michael Douglas]]. In ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', the titular pair work with [[Hank Pym]] to retrieve [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]] from the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]].\n\nTalks for a sequel to ''Ant-Man'' began shortly after that film was released. ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was officially announced in October 2015, with Rudd and Lilly returning to reprise their roles. A month later, ''Ant-Man'' director Reed was officially set to return. He had joined the first film later in the process and was excited to develop this one from the beginning. He also looked forward to introducing Hope van Dyne as the Wasp in this film, and insisted on treating Lang and her as equals. Filming took place from August to November 2017, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], as well as [[Metro Atlanta]], [[San Francisco]], [[Savannah, Georgia]] and Hawaii.\n\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had its world premiere in Hollywood on June 25, 2018, and was released on July 6, 2018, in the United States in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]]. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its levity, humor and performances, particularly those of Rudd and Lilly, and grossed over $622 million worldwide. A sequel is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo years after [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] was placed under house arrest due to his involvement with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], in violation of the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} [[Hank Pym]] and his daughter [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]] briefly manage to open a tunnel to the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]]. They believe Pym's wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]] might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become [[Quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have because of Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a large ant as a decoy so as not to arouse the suspicions of FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]]. Believing the message from Janet is confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black-market dealer [[Sonny Burch]], but Burch realizes the potential profit to be made from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|ghost]]\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym reluctantly takes Hope and Lang to visit his estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]], who helps them locate the lab. The ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father, [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Elihas]], another of Pym's former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition, and they plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners [[Luis (Marvel Comics)|Luis]], Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see that he is violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but Burch and his men also attack Lang and Hope which allows Ava to begin taking Janet's energy by force. Luis, Dave, and Kurt incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym finds Janet alive, and they return safely from the quantum realm. Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, the other three turn to dust.{{refn|name=InfinityWar|group=N|Due to the ending of the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"MidCredits\" />}}\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang / Ant-Man]]: <br />A former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.<ref name=\"ReedDouglas\" /> Following the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Lang escapes from the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft prison]], director [[Peyton Reed]] said that \"he's a fugitive in most of the first ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' movie.

He hoped to incorporate additional flashback sequences in the film, as well as explore Pym's various identities from the comics and his psychology. Reed also said he was \"excited\" about exploring and discovering the film version of the Ant-Man and Wasp relationship that is \"a romantic partnership and a heroic partnership\" in the comics, a \"different dynamic than we've seen in the rest of the [MCU], an actual partnership.\" Additionally, Reed mentioned that pre-production would \"probably\" start in October 2016, with filming scheduled for early 2017.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\" /> Production writers for the first film, Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer, signed on to write the script along with Rudd,<ref name=\"Writers\" /> with writing starting \"in earnest\" in January 2016.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\" /> The next month, McKay stated that he would be involved with the film in some capacity.<ref name=\"McKayFeb2016\" /> By April, the four writers and Reed had been \"holed up in a room ... brainstorming the story\", with Reed promising that it would have \"stuff in it that you've never ever seen in a movie before\".<ref name=\"ReedApr2016\" /> Feige added that they wanted to \"stay true to what made [''Ant-Man''] so unique and different\", and teased the potential of seeing the [[Giant-Man]] version of Lang that had been introduced in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Despite being \"intimately involved in the writing and the development of the script\", Reed did not take or receive a writing credit on the film.<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" />\n\nIn June 2016, Reed said that for inspiration from the comics he had been looking at \"early ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' stuff and all the way up to the [[Nick Spencer]] stuff now\", and was focusing on iconic images that could be replicated in the film over story beats from the comics.

However, the writers chose to remove the appearance in the final script since the events of ''Civil War'' were already referenced frequently in the film, and this instance \"didn\u2019t feel organic to the story.\"<ref name=\"CapCameo\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nAt the start of November 2016, Reed said that the film's production would transition from \"the writing phase\" to \"official prep\" that month, beginning with visual development. Reed reiterated his excitement for introducing the Wasp and \"really designing her look, the way she moves, the power set, and figuring out, sort of, who Hope van Dyne is as a hero\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> Reed was inspired by the films ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988), and ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972) for the look and feel of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"What'sUpDoc\" /> While the first film was more of a heist film, Reed described this as part action film, part romantic comedy, and was inspired by the works of [[Elmore Leonard]] where there are \"villains, but we also have antagonists, and we have these roadblocks to our heroes getting to where they need to be\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\" /> He also stated his disappointment in the Giant-Man introduction happening in ''Civil War'', rather than an Ant-Man film,<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> but noted that the appearance provided character development opportunities between Lang, Pym, and Van Dyne since Pym is \"very clear in the first movie about how he feels about Stark and how he feels about The Avengers and being very protective of this technology that he has\",<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\" /> and so Reed thought Pym would be \"pissed\" and Van Dyne would feel betrayed, which was Reed's \"in\" for those characters' starting dynamics.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> Reed added that he spends \"a lot of time\" talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films, and that he and the writers on this film wished to maintain \"our little Ant-Man corner of the universe. Because it's a whole different vibe tonally\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]] returned to consult on the film, after doing the same on ''Ant-Man'', and explained the science behind getting extremely small to the filmmakers. Michalakis described the subatomic realm as \"a place of infinite possibility, an alternative universe where the laws of physics and forces of nature as we know them haven\u2019t crystallized\" and suggested it should be represented in the film by \"beautiful colors changing constantly to reflect transience.\"<ref name=\"ScienceConsultants\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Douglas confirmed that he would reprise his role as Hank Pym in the film.<ref name=\"DouglasConfirmed\" /> During the Hollywood premiere of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' in April, Dastmalchian confirmed his return as Kurt,<ref name=\"Dastmalchian\" /> and a month later, Harris confirmed his return as Dave as well.<ref name=\"Harris\" /> Through that May, Marvel was meeting with several actresses for a \"key role\" in the sequel, with [[Hannah John-Kamen]] cast in the part at the beginning of June.<ref name=\"John-Kamen\" /> The following month, [[Randall Park]] joined the cast as [[Jimmy Woo]],<ref name=\"Park\" /> and [[Walton Goggins]] was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Goggins\" /> At San Diego Comic-Con 2017, Park's casting was confirmed; John-Kamen and Goggins' roles were revealed to be [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Sonny Burch]], respectively; and the casting of Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne and [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] was announced.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> [[Judy Greer]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as Maggie from the previous film the following week.<ref name=\"Greer\" /> Louise Frogley served as costume designer on the film after doing so for Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), and worked with Ivo Coveney to create the superhero suits for the film. Based on designs by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], the suits are updated for the film from the 1960s-inspired designs used in the first ''Ant-Man'' to more modern designs. The Wasp suit included practical wings which were replaced with digital wings for when they are expanded and ready for flight.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n\nThe [[Russo brothers]], directors of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', which were filming while ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was preparing to film, were in constant discussion with Reed in order to ensure story elements would line up between the films. Joe Russo added that ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would have \"some [plot] elements that stitch in\" closely with ''Avengers: Infinity War'', more so than some of the other films leading up to the Avengers films.<ref name=\"RussosIW\" /> Reed knew ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would be \"a fairly stand-alone movie but... could not ignore the events of ''Infinity War''\", with the biggest connection occurring in the film's [[mid-credit scene]]. Since the events of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' occur over 48 hours, the timeline in relation to ''Infinity War'' was \"left purposefully ambiguous\" with Reed noting there had been discussions of placing \"little Easter eggs along the way, to start to reveal to the audience where the movie takes place in the timeline, [but t]hat felt not very fun to us and kind of obvious.\" Reed also liked how the film ends with closure and on a positive note \"and then to BANG \u2014 give the audience a gut punch right after the main credits\",<ref name=\"ReedPostCreditPolygon\" /> with the sequence showing Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and Hope van Dyne disintegrating due to the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War''. The film also has a post-credit scene that shows the ant who doubled for Lang while under house arrest performing a drum solo.<ref name=\"MidCredits\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Lombard Street San Francisco 2004.jpg|thumb|Additional filming took place in San Francisco, the setting of the film, including for an action sequence on [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] (pictured).]]\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 1, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Cherry Blue'';<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Dante Spinotti]] served as director of photography,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> shooting on [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Arri Alexa 65]] cameras, with some sequences being shot with a [[Frazier lens]].<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> At the start of filming, Marvel revealed that [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Abby Ryder Fortson]] would also reprise their roles from the first film, respectively as Paxton and [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]], and that [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and Erik Sommers had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" />\n\nThe film's lab and quantum tunnel set was inspired by ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' (1966\u201367), and was the largest physical set built for an MCU film, which Reed jokingly said was \"a little counter-intuitive\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> For the sequence where Janet van Dyne communicates through Lang, inspiration was taken from ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' (1984) in which [[Lily Tomlin]]'s character is trapped in the body of [[Steve Martin]]'s character. There were discussions about having Pfeiffer perform the scene first to give Rudd an idea of how she would act, but the group ultimately decided to let Rudd invent the scene completely himself.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> For the chamber in Ghost's lair, the production team under production designer Shepherd Frankel wanted to create an environment that was unique to the MCU, and designed the chamber with [[fresnel lens]]es to give it concentric-circle patterns that served a practical purpose for the film's story as well as differentiating the esthetics of it from other sets and creating mystery about the character. The chamber is surrounded by \"support shapes\" to \"create this feeling of desperation and yearning for family and stability\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n\nFilming also took place in [[Metro Atlanta]], with filming locations including the [[Atlanta International School]], the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] and [[Buckhead]] districts of Atlanta, and the [[Samuel M. Inman]] Middle School in the city's [[Virginia-Highland]] neighborhood; as well as [[Emory University]] and the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] in [[Hampton, Georgia]].<ref name=\"MetroAtlantaFilming\" /> Additional filming took place in [[San Francisco]] in September 2017,<ref name=\"SanFranFilming\" /> in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in late October,<ref name=\"SavannahFilming\" /> and in Hawaii.<ref name=\"HawaiiFilming\" /> Production [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on November 19, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn late November, Lilly said that the characters would try to enter the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] in the film, and their potential success would \"open a whole entire new [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multi-verse]] to enter into and play around in\" for the MCU.<ref name=\"VanityFairNov2017\" /> The film includes a clip from ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978), which Reed was reminded of while discussing the quantum realm science for the film. Reed insisted that the film be shorter than two hours since it would be following the \"massive epic\" ''Infinity War'' and because it is \"an action/comedy, and it didn't want to overstay its welcome\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> Dan Lebental and [[Craig Wood (film editor)|Craig Wood]] edited the film.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> The film's main credits sequence is a \"table-top\" version of its action sequences,<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> and was created by Elastic.<ref name=\"Elastic\" /> An alternative idea that had been considered was to create a \"fake behind-the-scenes documentary\" that would have made the film look like it was a 1950s-era [[Godzilla]] movie with \"people in suits stomping on model cityscapes\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Michelle Pfeiffer in Ant-Man and the Wasp.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Michelle Pfeiffer 01.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer    = [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was digitally [[de-aging in film|de-aged]] in ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' (top) to appear as she did circa 1985 (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[DNEG]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Method Studios]], [[Luma Pictures]], Lola VFX, [[Industrial Light & Magic]],<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Cinesite]], [[Rise FX]], [[Rodeo FX]], Crafty Apes, Perception NYC, [[Digital Domain]], and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" />\n\nDNEG worked on over 500 shots, including the effects for Ghost\u2014which were shared with the other vendors\u2014the third act chase sequence, and the final Ghost fight as Hank and Janet are returning from the quantum realm. For the \"macro-photography\" sequences in the film, DNEG took a different approach from their work in ''Ant-Man'' due to issues including trying to get a camera to seem small enough to capture the small actions. Though some of the film was shot with a [[Frazier lens]] that provides extra depth of field, DNEG would still need to \"re-project the road higher and \"raise the floor level\" to simulate a tiny sized camera\". As the third act chase sequence was mainly shot in Atlanta, while being set in San Francisco, DNEG VFX Supervisor Alessandro Ongaro noted it required \"extensive environment work\" with background elements in some shots not being salvageable at all.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> DNEG ultimately created 130 unique environments for the chase. Clear Angle aided DNEG with the [[Lidar]] surveying and photography of San Francisco, and were able to get their information for [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] down to the millimeter resolution.<ref name=\"VFXVoice\" />\n\nLola once again worked on the de-aging sequences with Douglas, Pfeiffer, and Fishburne. The flashback sequences featuring a younger Hank Pym were set around the same time as the flashback sequences of ''Ant-Man'', so Lola were able to use a similar process, referencing Douglas' appearance in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and having the actor on set in a different wardrobe and wig. Lola VFX Supervisor Trent Claus felt Pfeiffer's was less complicated, since \"she has aged incredibly well\" and still has big hair and a big smile. Pfeiffer's work from ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985) and other films around that time was referenced. For Fishburne, his son served as his younger double, and helped inform Lola how the older Fishburne's skin would have looked in certain lighting situations. The films Lola looked to for Fishburne's younger self included ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Deep Cover]]'' (1992). Lola also made Fishburne thinner, and all actors had their posture adjusted.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma worked on the scenes where Ant-Man and the Wasp infiltrate Ghost's hideout, where they had to recreate the entire environment with CGI. They also created the first quantum tunnel sequence where Ghost receives her powers, and the flashback missile launch, which had to be replicated exactly from how it appeared in ''Ant-Man''. The new version of the quantum realm, designed by Reed and production VFX supervisor Stephane Ceretti, was created by Method. Method Studios VFX Supervisor Andrew Hellen, explained, \"We did a lot of research into macro and cellular level photography, and played with different ways to visualize quantum mechanics. It has a very magical quality, with a scientific edge. We also used glitching effects and macro lensing to ground the footage, and keep it from feeling too terrestrial.\" Method also worked on the sequence when Lang is the size of a preschooler, and created the digital doubles for Ant-Man and Wasp; Method used the same level of detail on the digital double suits regardless of what scale they were.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Ant-Man and the Wasp (soundtrack)}}\nIn June 2017, Reed confirmed that [[Christophe Beck]], who composed the score for ''Ant-Man'', would return for ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"Beck\" /> Beck reprised his main theme from ''Ant-Man'', and also wrote a new one for Wasp that he wanted to be \"high energy\" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Lang. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be \"enough newness in the score to feel like it\u2019s going new places, and isn\u2019t just some retread.\"<ref name=\"BeckFMM\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] and [[Marvel Music]] released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018.<ref name=\"FilmMusicReporter\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nConcept art and \"pre-CGI video\" for the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\" /> In January 2018, [[Hyundai Motor America]] announced that the 2019 [[Hyundai Veloster]] would play a significant role in the film, with other Hyundai vehicles also appearing.<ref name=\"Hyundai\" /> The first trailer for the film was released on January 30, 2018 on ''[[Good Morning America]]'',<ref name=\"DeadlineTrailer1\" /> and used the guitar riff from [[Adam and the Ants]]' \"Ants Invasion\".<ref name=\"AntsMusic\" /> David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the release, the day after the widely praised ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' premiere, a \"smart move\"; with ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' also releasing in 2018, \"it can be easy [to] forget that hey, there {{em|is}} an ''Ant-Man'' sequel coming this year... So Marvel Studios giving us a quick reminder with this trailer release is logical\".<ref name=\"WPTrailer1\" /> Tracy Brown, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', praised how the trailer prominently featured Lilly's Van Dyne showing \"she was always meant to be a superhero\".<ref name=\"LATimesTrailer1\" /> A second trailer was released on May 1, 2018, following a teaser video featuring the ''Infinity War'' cast asking \"where were Ant-Man and The Wasp?\" in that film.<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt the trailer made the film feel \"very much like an intentional antidote for, or at least alternative to, the grimness of ''Infinity War''{{'}}s downbeat ending\", calling it \"a smart move\" since it could be considered \"a palate cleanser and proof that Marvel has more to offer... before audiences dive back into the core narrative with next year's ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" /> In June 2018, Feige presented several scenes from the film at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> [[Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!]], an attraction inspired by the film, opened at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] on March 31, 2019. It features Rudd and Lilly reprising their roles in clips that were made during the film's reshoots.<ref name=\"NanoBattle\" /> Promotional partners for the film included [[Dell]], [[Synchrony Financial]], and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]]. Disney spent around $154 million worldwide promoting the film.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had its world premiere at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 25, 2018,<ref name=\"HollywoodPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States on July 6, 2018,<ref name=\"FilmAnnounced\" /> where it opened in 4,206 theaters, of which 3,000 were in [[3D film|3D]], 403 were in [[IMAX]], over 660 were in premium large format, and over 220 were in [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] and [[4D film|4D]].<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\nThe film was scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2018, but was rescheduled in November 2017 to August 3, 2018,<ref name=\"UKOriginalRelease\" /> in order to avoid competition with the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. Charles Gant of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Screen International]]'' noted, \"The worry for film distributors is that audiences will be caught up in the tournament. So it's easier to play safe and not date your film at this time, especially during the group stage, when all the qualifying nations are competing.\" Tom Butler of [[Yahoo! Movies]] UK added that, unlike the first film, which was one of the lowest-grossing MCU films in the UK, anticipation levels for the film \"are at an all-time high following the events of ''Infinity War''\" and \"UK audiences will probably have found out what happens in the film well before it opens in UK cinemas, and this could have a negative impact on its box office potential.\"<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\" /> Butler and Huw Fullerton of ''[[Radio Times]]'' both opined the delay could also be in part because of Disney also delaying the United Kingdom release of ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' to July 13, 2018 (a month after its United States release), and not wanting to compete with itself with the two films.<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\" /><ref name=\"UKReleaseRadioTimes\" /> This in turn led fans in the country to start a [[Change.org]] petition to have Disney move the release date up several weeks, similarly to how ''Avengers: Infinity War''{{'}}s United States release was moved up a week the previous May.<ref name=\"UKReleasePetition\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on October 2, 2018, and on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD]] on October 16.

He also wrote that the film had too many subplots and not enough of Pfeiffer, but was pleased with the lack of connection that the overall story had to the rest of the MCU, and with the focus on \"pop trash\" comedy.<ref name=\"BostonGlobeReview\" /> Stephanie Zachareck, writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', said it was \"hard to actively dislike\" the film, which she thought had reasonably fun action and stand-out moments between Rudd and Fortson; but she was not as impressed with the larger, effects-heavy action sequences and felt the focus on Lilly as a better hero than Rudd was \"just checking off boxes in the name of gender equality.\"<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| [[Golden Trailer Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| May 29, 2019\n| Best Home Ent Action\n| \"Bonus Trailer\" (Tiny Hero)\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|<ref name=\"GoldenTrailer\" />\n|-\n| Best Home Ent Fantasy Adventure\n| \"Watch Me\" (Trailer Park, Inc.)\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n| \"War\" (AV Squad)\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Voice Over TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n| \"War\" (AV Squad)\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Hollywood Music in Media Awards]]\n| [[9th Hollywood Music in Media Awards|November 14, 2018]]\n| Original Score \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror Film\n| [[Christophe Beck]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"HMiMA\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[St. Louis Film Critics Association]]\n| December 16, 2018\n| Best Action Film\n| ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref name=\"SLFCA18\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n| [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards|January 27, 2019]]\n| [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture]]\n| ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"SAGAwards\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| [[Teen Choice Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"3\"| [[2019 Teen Choice Awards|August 11, 2019]]\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie \u2013 Action|Choice Action Movie]]\n| ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|<ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actor\n| [[Paul Rudd]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actress\n| [[Evangeline Lilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Visual Effects Society|Visual Effects Society Awards]]\n|[[17th Visual Effects Society Awards|February 5, 2019]]\n|[[Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Created Environment in a Photoreal Feature|Outstanding Created Environment in a Photoreal Feature]]\n|Florian Witzel, Harsh Mistri, Yuri Serizawa, Can Yuksel for ''Journey to the Quantum Realm''\n|{{nom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref name=\"VESAwards\" />\n|}\n\n== Sequel ==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\nAhead of the film's release, Reed noted that he and Marvel were \"hopeful\" about a third film, having discussed potential story points.<ref name=\"ReedTHRJul2018\" /> Michael Douglas also expressed interest in playing a younger version of his character Hank Pym in a prequel,<ref name=\"ScreenRantHankPym\" /> something which Reed already teased back in 2015.<ref name=\"ReedFuture\" /> In February 2019, Douglas said of a possible sequel, \"There's been talk [about another ''Ant-Man'']...

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the sequel to 2015's ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twentieth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Peyton Reed]] and written by the writing teams of [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and [[Erik Sommers]], and [[Paul Rudd]], Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. It stars Rudd as Lang and [[Evangeline Lilly]] as Van Dyne, alongside [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Judy Greer]], [[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[David Dastmalchian]], [[Hannah John-Kamen]], [[Abby Ryder Fortson]], [[Randall Park]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Michael Douglas]]. In ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', the titular pair work with [[Hank Pym]] to retrieve [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]] from the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]].\n\nTalks for a sequel to ''Ant-Man'' began shortly after that film was released. ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was officially announced in October 2015, with Rudd and Lilly returning to reprise their roles. A month later, ''Ant-Man'' director Reed was officially set to return. He had joined the first film later in the process and was excited to develop this one from the beginning. He also looked forward to introducing Hope van Dyne as the Wasp in this film, and insisted on treating Lang and her as equals. Filming took place from August to November 2017, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], as well as [[Metro Atlanta]], [[San Francisco]], [[Savannah, Georgia]] and Hawaii.\n\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had its world premiere in Hollywood on June 25, 2018, and was released on July 6, 2018, in the United States in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]]. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its levity, humor and performances, particularly those of Rudd and Lilly, and grossed over $622 million worldwide. A sequel is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo years after [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] was placed under house arrest due to his involvement with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], in violation of the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} [[Hank Pym]] and his daughter [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]] briefly manage to open a tunnel to the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]]. They believe Pym's wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]] might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become [[Quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have because of Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a large ant as a decoy so as not to arouse the suspicions of FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]]. Believing the message from Janet is confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black-market dealer [[Sonny Burch]], but Burch realizes the potential profit to be made from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|ghost]]\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym reluctantly takes Hope and Lang to visit his estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]], who helps them locate the lab. The ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father, [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Elihas]], another of Pym's former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition, and they plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners [[Luis (Marvel Comics)|Luis]], Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see that he is violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but Burch and his men also attack Lang and Hope which allows Ava to begin taking Janet's energy by force. Luis, Dave, and Kurt incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym finds Janet alive, and they return safely from the quantum realm. Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, the other three turn to dust.{{refn|name=InfinityWar|group=N|Due to the ending of the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"MidCredits\" />}}\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang / Ant-Man]]: <br />A former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.<ref name=\"ReedDouglas\" /> Following the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Lang escapes from the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft prison]], director [[Peyton Reed]] said that \"he's a fugitive in most of the first ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' movie.

He had \"definite ideas\" of who should portray that character.<ref name=\"ReedMTV\" /> Reed said the alternate title ''Wasp and the Ant-Man'' was briefly considered, but was not chosen due to fan expectation given the comics history of the phrase \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\".<ref name=\"SwappedTitle\" /> That month, [[Adam McKay]], one of the writers of ''Ant-Man'', expressed interest in returning to write the film,<ref name=\"McKayInterest\" /> and Douglas confirmed that he was in talks to return as well.<ref name=\"ReedDouglas\" />\n\n[[File:Peyton Reed (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Director Peyton Reed was excited to develop the sequel from \"the ground up\" after joining the first ''Ant-Man'' late in the process.]]\nReed stated in early December that the film may \"call back\" to the [[heist film]] genre and tone of ''Ant-Man'', but that ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would \"have an entirely different genre template\". He hoped to incorporate additional flashback sequences in the film, as well as explore Pym's various identities from the comics and his psychology. Reed also said he was \"excited\" about exploring and discovering the film version of the Ant-Man and Wasp relationship that is \"a romantic partnership and a heroic partnership\" in the comics, a \"different dynamic than we've seen in the rest of the [MCU], an actual partnership.\" Additionally, Reed mentioned that pre-production would \"probably\" start in October 2016, with filming scheduled for early 2017.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\" /> Production writers for the first film, Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer, signed on to write the script along with Rudd,<ref name=\"Writers\" /> with writing starting \"in earnest\" in January 2016.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\" /> The next month, McKay stated that he would be involved with the film in some capacity.<ref name=\"McKayFeb2016\" /> By April, the four writers and Reed had been \"holed up in a room ... brainstorming the story\", with Reed promising that it would have \"stuff in it that you've never ever seen in a movie before\".<ref name=\"ReedApr2016\" /> Feige added that they wanted to \"stay true to what made [''Ant-Man''] so unique and different\", and teased the potential of seeing the [[Giant-Man]] version of Lang that had been introduced in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Despite being \"intimately involved in the writing and the development of the script\", Reed did not take or receive a writing credit on the film.<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" />\n\nIn June 2016, Reed said that for inspiration from the comics he had been looking at \"early ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' stuff and all the way up to the [[Nick Spencer]] stuff now\", and was focusing on iconic images that could be replicated in the film over story beats from the comics. He added that there was \"definitely a chance\" for [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], and Dastmalchian to reprise their respective roles as [[Luis (Marvel Comics)|Luis]], Dave, and Kurt from the first film.<ref name=\"ReedJun2016\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2016, Feige stated that Reed and Rudd were still working on the script,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> and that filming was now expected to begin in June 2017.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"JuneStart\" /> Rudd elaborated that they had \"turned in a treatment, but it's so preliminary. We'll see. We have an idea of what it might look like, but it could change a lot from where we're at now.\"<ref name=\"RuddETAug2016\" /> The next month, Pe\u00f1a was confirmed to be returning as Luis,<ref name=\"Pena\" /> while filming was revealed to be taking place in Atlanta, Georgia.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /> In early October, an initial script had been completed for the film that was awaiting approval from Marvel.<ref name=\"InitialScript\" /> Reed later revealed that early drafts of the script included a cameo appearance from [[Captain America]], appearing during Luis' flashback sequences as he was recapping Lang's involvement in the airport battle in ''Captain America: Civil War''. However, the writers chose to remove the appearance in the final script since the events of ''Civil War'' were already referenced frequently in the film, and this instance \"didn\u2019t feel organic to the story.\"<ref name=\"CapCameo\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nAt the start of November 2016, Reed said that the film's production would transition from \"the writing phase\" to \"official prep\" that month, beginning with visual development. Reed reiterated his excitement for introducing the Wasp and \"really designing her look, the way she moves, the power set, and figuring out, sort of, who Hope van Dyne is as a hero\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> Reed was inspired by the films ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988), and ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972) for the look and feel of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"What'sUpDoc\" /> While the first film was more of a heist film, Reed described this as part action film, part romantic comedy, and was inspired by the works of [[Elmore Leonard]] where there are \"villains, but we also have antagonists, and we have these roadblocks to our heroes getting to where they need to be\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\" /> He also stated his disappointment in the Giant-Man introduction happening in ''Civil War'', rather than an Ant-Man film,<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> but noted that the appearance provided character development opportunities between Lang, Pym, and Van Dyne since Pym is \"very clear in the first movie about how he feels about Stark and how he feels about The Avengers and being very protective of this technology that he has\",<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\" /> and so Reed thought Pym would be \"pissed\" and Van Dyne would feel betrayed, which was Reed's \"in\" for those characters' starting dynamics.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> Reed added that he spends \"a lot of time\" talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films, and that he and the writers on this film wished to maintain \"our little Ant-Man corner of the universe. Because it's a whole different vibe tonally\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\" /> Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]] returned to consult on the film, after doing the same on ''Ant-Man'', and explained the science behind getting extremely small to the filmmakers. Michalakis described the subatomic realm as \"a place of infinite possibility, an alternative universe where the laws of physics and forces of nature as we know them haven\u2019t crystallized\" and suggested it should be represented in the film by \"beautiful colors changing constantly to reflect transience.\"<ref name=\"ScienceConsultants\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Douglas confirmed that he would reprise his role as Hank Pym in the film.<ref name=\"DouglasConfirmed\" /> During the Hollywood premiere of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' in April, Dastmalchian confirmed his return as Kurt,<ref name=\"Dastmalchian\" /> and a month later, Harris confirmed his return as Dave as well.<ref name=\"Harris\" /> Through that May, Marvel was meeting with several actresses for a \"key role\" in the sequel, with [[Hannah John-Kamen]] cast in the part at the beginning of June.<ref name=\"John-Kamen\" /> The following month, [[Randall Park]] joined the cast as [[Jimmy Woo]],<ref name=\"Park\" /> and [[Walton Goggins]] was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Goggins\" /> At San Diego Comic-Con 2017, Park's casting was confirmed; John-Kamen and Goggins' roles were revealed to be [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Sonny Burch]], respectively; and the casting of Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne and [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] was announced.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> [[Judy Greer]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as Maggie from the previous film the following week.<ref name=\"Greer\" /> Louise Frogley served as costume designer on the film after doing so for Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), and worked with Ivo Coveney to create the superhero suits for the film. Based on designs by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], the suits are updated for the film from the 1960s-inspired designs used in the first ''Ant-Man'' to more modern designs. The Wasp suit included practical wings which were replaced with digital wings for when they are expanded and ready for flight.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n\nThe [[Russo brothers]], directors of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', which were filming while ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was preparing to film, were in constant discussion with Reed in order to ensure story elements would line up between the films. Joe Russo added that ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would have \"some [plot] elements that stitch in\" closely with ''Avengers: Infinity War'', more so than some of the other films leading up to the Avengers films.<ref name=\"RussosIW\" /> Reed knew ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would be \"a fairly stand-alone movie but... could not ignore the events of ''Infinity War''\", with the biggest connection occurring in the film's [[mid-credit scene]]. Since the events of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' occur over 48 hours, the timeline in relation to ''Infinity War'' was \"left purposefully ambiguous\" with Reed noting there had been discussions of placing \"little Easter eggs along the way, to start to reveal to the audience where the movie takes place in the timeline, [but t]hat felt not very fun to us and kind of obvious.\" Reed also liked how the film ends with closure and on a positive note \"and then to BANG \u2014 give the audience a gut punch right after the main credits\",<ref name=\"ReedPostCreditPolygon\" /> with the sequence showing Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and Hope van Dyne disintegrating due to the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War''. The film also has a post-credit scene that shows the ant who doubled for Lang while under house arrest performing a drum solo.<ref name=\"MidCredits\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Lombard Street San Francisco 2004.jpg|thumb|Additional filming took place in San Francisco, the setting of the film, including for an action sequence on [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] (pictured).]]\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 1, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Cherry Blue'';<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Dante Spinotti]] served as director of photography,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> shooting on [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Arri Alexa 65]] cameras, with some sequences being shot with a [[Frazier lens]].<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> At the start of filming, Marvel revealed that [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Abby Ryder Fortson]] would also reprise their roles from the first film, respectively as Paxton and [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]], and that [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and Erik Sommers had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" />\n\nThe film's lab and quantum tunnel set was inspired by ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' (1966\u201367), and was the largest physical set built for an MCU film, which Reed jokingly said was \"a little counter-intuitive\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> For the sequence where Janet van Dyne communicates through Lang, inspiration was taken from ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' (1984) in which [[Lily Tomlin]]'s character is trapped in the body of [[Steve Martin]]'s character. There were discussions about having Pfeiffer perform the scene first to give Rudd an idea of how she would act, but the group ultimately decided to let Rudd invent the scene completely himself.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> For the chamber in Ghost's lair, the production team under production designer Shepherd Frankel wanted to create an environment that was unique to the MCU, and designed the chamber with [[fresnel lens]]es to give it concentric-circle patterns that served a practical purpose for the film's story as well as differentiating the esthetics of it from other sets and creating mystery about the character. The chamber is surrounded by \"support shapes\" to \"create this feeling of desperation and yearning for family and stability\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n\nFilming also took place in [[Metro Atlanta]], with filming locations including the [[Atlanta International School]], the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] and [[Buckhead]] districts of Atlanta, and the [[Samuel M. Inman]] Middle School in the city's [[Virginia-Highland]] neighborhood; as well as [[Emory University]] and the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] in [[Hampton, Georgia]].<ref name=\"MetroAtlantaFilming\" /> Additional filming took place in [[San Francisco]] in September 2017,<ref name=\"SanFranFilming\" /> in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in late October,<ref name=\"SavannahFilming\" /> and in Hawaii.<ref name=\"HawaiiFilming\" /> Production [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on November 19, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn late November, Lilly said that the characters would try to enter the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] in the film, and their potential success would \"open a whole entire new [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multi-verse]] to enter into and play around in\" for the MCU.<ref name=\"VanityFairNov2017\" /> The film includes a clip from ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978), which Reed was reminded of while discussing the quantum realm science for the film. Reed insisted that the film be shorter than two hours since it would be following the \"massive epic\" ''Infinity War'' and because it is \"an action/comedy, and it didn't want to overstay its welcome\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> Dan Lebental and [[Craig Wood (film editor)|Craig Wood]] edited the film.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> The film's main credits sequence is a \"table-top\" version of its action sequences,<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" /> and was created by Elastic.<ref name=\"Elastic\" /> An alternative idea that had been considered was to create a \"fake behind-the-scenes documentary\" that would have made the film look like it was a 1950s-era [[Godzilla]] movie with \"people in suits stomping on model cityscapes\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Michelle Pfeiffer in Ant-Man and the Wasp.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Michelle Pfeiffer 01.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer    = [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was digitally [[de-aging in film|de-aged]] in ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' (top) to appear as she did circa 1985 (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[DNEG]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Method Studios]], [[Luma Pictures]], Lola VFX, [[Industrial Light & Magic]],<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Cinesite]], [[Rise FX]], [[Rodeo FX]], Crafty Apes, Perception NYC, [[Digital Domain]], and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" />\n\nDNEG worked on over 500 shots, including the effects for Ghost\u2014which were shared with the other vendors\u2014the third act chase sequence, and the final Ghost fight as Hank and Janet are returning from the quantum realm. For the \"macro-photography\" sequences in the film, DNEG took a different approach from their work in ''Ant-Man'' due to issues including trying to get a camera to seem small enough to capture the small actions. Though some of the film was shot with a [[Frazier lens]] that provides extra depth of field, DNEG would still need to \"re-project the road higher and \"raise the floor level\" to simulate a tiny sized camera\". As the third act chase sequence was mainly shot in Atlanta, while being set in San Francisco, DNEG VFX Supervisor Alessandro Ongaro noted it required \"extensive environment work\" with background elements in some shots not being salvageable at all.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> DNEG ultimately created 130 unique environments for the chase. Clear Angle aided DNEG with the [[Lidar]] surveying and photography of San Francisco, and were able to get their information for [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] down to the millimeter resolution.<ref name=\"VFXVoice\" />\n\nLola once again worked on the de-aging sequences with Douglas, Pfeiffer, and Fishburne. The flashback sequences featuring a younger Hank Pym were set around the same time as the flashback sequences of ''Ant-Man'', so Lola were able to use a similar process, referencing Douglas' appearance in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and having the actor on set in a different wardrobe and wig. Lola VFX Supervisor Trent Claus felt Pfeiffer's was less complicated, since \"she has aged incredibly well\" and still has big hair and a big smile. Pfeiffer's work from ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985) and other films around that time was referenced. For Fishburne, his son served as his younger double, and helped inform Lola how the older Fishburne's skin would have looked in certain lighting situations. The films Lola looked to for Fishburne's younger self included ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Deep Cover]]'' (1992). Lola also made Fishburne thinner, and all actors had their posture adjusted.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma worked on the scenes where Ant-Man and the Wasp infiltrate Ghost's hideout, where they had to recreate the entire environment with CGI. They also created the first quantum tunnel sequence where Ghost receives her powers, and the flashback missile launch, which had to be replicated exactly from how it appeared in ''Ant-Man''. The new version of the quantum realm, designed by Reed and production VFX supervisor Stephane Ceretti, was created by Method. Method Studios VFX Supervisor Andrew Hellen, explained, \"We did a lot of research into macro and cellular level photography, and played with different ways to visualize quantum mechanics. It has a very magical quality, with a scientific edge. We also used glitching effects and macro lensing to ground the footage, and keep it from feeling too terrestrial.\" Method also worked on the sequence when Lang is the size of a preschooler, and created the digital doubles for Ant-Man and Wasp; Method used the same level of detail on the digital double suits regardless of what scale they were.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Ant-Man and the Wasp (soundtrack)}}\nIn June 2017, Reed confirmed that [[Christophe Beck]], who composed the score for ''Ant-Man'', would return for ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"Beck\" /> Beck reprised his main theme from ''Ant-Man'', and also wrote a new one for Wasp that he wanted to be \"high energy\" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Lang. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be \"enough newness in the score to feel like it\u2019s going new places, and isn\u2019t just some retread.\"<ref name=\"BeckFMM\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] and [[Marvel Music]] released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018.<ref name=\"FilmMusicReporter\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nConcept art and \"pre-CGI video\" for the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\" /> In January 2018, [[Hyundai Motor America]] announced that the 2019 [[Hyundai Veloster]] would play a significant role in the film, with other Hyundai vehicles also appearing.<ref name=\"Hyundai\" /> The first trailer for the film was released on January 30, 2018 on ''[[Good Morning America]]'',<ref name=\"DeadlineTrailer1\" /> and used the guitar riff from [[Adam and the Ants]]' \"Ants Invasion\".<ref name=\"AntsMusic\" /> David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the release, the day after the widely praised ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' premiere, a \"smart move\"; with ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' also releasing in 2018, \"it can be easy [to] forget that hey, there {{em|is}} an ''Ant-Man'' sequel coming this year... So Marvel Studios giving us a quick reminder with this trailer release is logical\".<ref name=\"WPTrailer1\" /> Tracy Brown, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', praised how the trailer prominently featured Lilly's Van Dyne showing \"she was always meant to be a superhero\".<ref name=\"LATimesTrailer1\" /> A second trailer was released on May 1, 2018, following a teaser video featuring the ''Infinity War'' cast asking \"where were Ant-Man and The Wasp?\" in that film.<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt the trailer made the film feel \"very much like an intentional antidote for, or at least alternative to, the grimness of ''Infinity War''{{'}}s downbeat ending\", calling it \"a smart move\" since it could be considered \"a palate cleanser and proof that Marvel has more to offer... before audiences dive back into the core narrative with next year's ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\" /> In June 2018, Feige presented several scenes from the film at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> [[Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!]], an attraction inspired by the film, opened at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] on March 31, 2019. It features Rudd and Lilly reprising their roles in clips that were made during the film's reshoots.<ref name=\"NanoBattle\" /> Promotional partners for the film included [[Dell]], [[Synchrony Financial]], and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]]. Disney spent around $154 million worldwide promoting the film.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had its world premiere at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 25, 2018,<ref name=\"HollywoodPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States on July 6, 2018,<ref name=\"FilmAnnounced\" /> where it opened in 4,206 theaters, of which 3,000 were in [[3D film|3D]], 403 were in [[IMAX]], over 660 were in premium large format, and over 220 were in [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] and [[4D film|4D]].<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\nThe film was scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2018, but was rescheduled in November 2017 to August 3, 2018,<ref name=\"UKOriginalRelease\" /> in order to avoid competition with the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. Charles Gant of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Screen International]]'' noted, \"The worry for film distributors is that audiences will be caught up in the tournament. So it's easier to play safe and not date your film at this time, especially during the group stage, when all the qualifying nations are competing.\" Tom Butler of [[Yahoo! Movies]] UK added that, unlike the first film, which was one of the lowest-grossing MCU films in the UK, anticipation levels for the film \"are at an all-time high following the events of ''Infinity War''\" and \"UK audiences will probably have found out what happens in the film well before it opens in UK cinemas, and this could have a negative impact on its box office potential.\"<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\" /> Butler and Huw Fullerton of ''[[Radio Times]]'' both opined the delay could also be in part because of Disney also delaying the United Kingdom release of ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' to July 13, 2018 (a month after its United States release), and not wanting to compete with itself with the two films.<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\" /><ref name=\"UKReleaseRadioTimes\" /> This in turn led fans in the country to start a [[Change.org]] petition to have Disney move the release date up several weeks, similarly to how ''Avengers: Infinity War''{{'}}s United States release was moved up a week the previous May.<ref name=\"UKReleasePetition\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on October 2, 2018, and on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD]] on October 16.

The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Moon|Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal.

The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal. In the outer worlds, the residents' efforts to enhance life, particularly terraforming on Mars, begin to wane, since much richer worlds are now available, and investment \"here at home\" is not as attractive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Thomas Jane]], [[Steven Strait]], [[Cas Anvar]]\n| image1      = Thomas Jane by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1      = 2104\n| height1     = 2992\n| image2      = Steven Strait at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg\n| width2      = 2504\n| height2     = 3340\n| image3      = Cas Anvar by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width3      = 1421\n| height3     = 1965\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Dominique Tipper]], [[Wes Chatham]], [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]\n| image1      = Dominique Tipper (2012) (cropped).jpg\n| width1      = 1006\n| height1     = 1420\n| image2      = Wes Chatham.jpg\n| width2      = 1497\n| height2     = 1786\n| image3      = ShohrehAghdashloo08TIFF (cropped).jpg\n| width3      = 468\n| height3     = 550\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Frankie Adams]], [[Florence Faivre]], [[Chad Coleman|Chad L.

[[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] was hired to write a script in January 2011. ''Black Panther'' was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making ''Black Panther'' the first Marvel film with a predominantly [[Black film|black cast]]. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], and [[Busan]], South Korea.\n\n''Black Panther'' premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16. The film received praise from critics for its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, though the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3&nbsp;billion worldwide and broke numerous [[List of Black Panther box office achievements|box office records]], including the highest-grossing film by a [[Black people|black]] director. It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

''Black Panther'' is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination, and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], two wins at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and twelve nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning three), among others.<!-- Please note.

One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of [[Wakanda]]. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a [[Third World]] country. In 1992, Wakanda's King [[T'Chaka]] visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in [[Oakland, California]]. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue]] with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. \n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" />}} his son [[T'Challa]] returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice [[Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] with his recuperation.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Black Panther cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|(L:R) Producer [[Kevin Feige]], director [[Ryan Coogler]], and actors [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Michael B.

Jordan]] joined in an undisclosed role, after previously working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'' and ''Creed''.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> Nate Moore, serving as a producer on the film by the end of May, stated that filming would occur in Atlanta, Georgia, with Marvel \"definitely investigating shooting in Africa\" as well.<ref name=\"MooreMay2016\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2016, Nyong'o was confirmed for the film, in the role of [[Malice (comics)|Nakia]], while Jordan's role was revealed to be [[Erik Stevens|Erik Killmonger]]. Also announced was [[Danai Gurira]] as [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]]. Coogler confirmed that filming would begin in January 2017.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\" /> Additional casting occurred from September 2016 until the start of filming, with [[Winston Duke]] cast as [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]], a role that [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]] had also tested for;<ref name=\"Duke\" /> [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]]; [[Daniel Kaluuya]] as [[W'Kabi]];<ref name=\"Whitaker\" /> [[Angela Bassett]] as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda;<ref name=\"Bassett\" /> [[Sterling K. Brown]] as N'Jobu;<ref name=\"Brown\" /> and [[Letitia Wright]] in an unspecified role.<ref name=\"Wright\" /> [[Florence Kasumba]] was revealed to be reprising her role as Ayo from ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"Whitaker\" /> [[Amandla Stenberg]], who is bi-racial and light skinned, was considered for a role in the film but was not comfortable taking the place of a dark-skinned actor, and described her decision to pass on the role as \"really challenging\".<ref name=\"Stenberg\" /> By January 2017, Marvel received permission from the [[Oakland, California]]-based public transit agency [[AC Transit]] to use their logo in the film for the opening flashback sequence. The setting was chosen due to Coogler growing up in that area.<ref name=\"ACTransitLogo\" />\n\n==== Writing ====\n[[File:Ryan Coogler by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coogler promoting ''Black Panther'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nThe production team was inspired by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]]' run on ''Black Panther'', who was writing the comic at the same time as they were working on the film. Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\".<ref name=\"CooglerVulture\" /> The film was also inspired by the comic runs of [[Jack Kirby]], [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), [[Jonathan Hickman]], and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.<ref name=\"ComingSoonSDCC\" /> The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Coogler had hoped to include [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kraven the Hunter]] early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available.<ref name=\"Kraven\" /> [[Donald Glover]] and his brother [[Stephen Glover (screenwriter)|Stephen]] made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]].<ref name=\"Glover\" /> Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was [[storyboard]]ed before being cut.<ref name=\"MooreHuffPostMay2018\" />\n\nFeige described ''Black Panther'' as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /> with ''Civil War'' laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> He also said the film would be a cross between ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\".<ref name=\"EWCoverJuly2017\" /> Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film ''[[A Prophet]]'' (2009) for inspiration.<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to [[Donald Trump]] becoming [[President of the United States]] after [[Barack Obama]], though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\"<ref name=\"EWBosemanJuly2017\" /> Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"FeigeGenreDescription\" /> ''Civil War'' did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the [[Xhosa language]], which Boseman was taught by [[John Kani]] who portrays T'Challa's father King [[T'Chaka]].<ref name=\"Xhosa\" /> Additional actors portraying Wakandans in ''Black Panther'' learned the language,<ref name=\"Nyongo/Film\" /> with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son [[Atandwa Kani|Atandwa]] served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.<ref name=\"NYTimesXhosa\" />\n\n==== Design ====\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,<ref name=\"Cole2\" /> rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\".<ref name=\"ColeAug2016\" /> Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country [[Lesotho]], a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly [[British colonization of Africa|colonized by the British]];<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /><ref name=\"LesothoVulture\" /> the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /> Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral [[coltan]] that can almost only be found in Congo.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,<ref name=\"NoManApe\" /> and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionDesign\" />\n\n===== Sets =====\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], pulling inspiration from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Ethiopia]],<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> as well as the designs of [[Zaha Hadid]],<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic [[Mali Empire]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].<ref name=\"CooglerTimbuktu\" /> Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a [[love letter]] to Africa.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern [[Afro-punk]] style of the Golden City, the capital.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> [[Rondavel]]s were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at [[Blyde River Canyon]] in South Africa.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" />\n\nBeachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by [[Lesotho]], the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on [[Nigerian]] writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|15}} including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the [[stainless steel]] look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the [[maglev]] and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the [[Congo peafowl]].<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" />\n\nThe majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the [[Oribi Gorge]]. The set was {{convert|36|ft}}, made up of a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|spell=in}} pool, and then {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} cliff faces that were designed to be extended to {{convert|100|ft}} with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with {{convert|25000|ft3}} of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===== Costumes =====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Masaai-women.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Dora Milaje in film.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The [[Maasai people]] of Kenya (top) inspired about 80% of the design of the [[Dora Milaje]], Wakanda's all-female special forces (bottom).<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nCostume designer [[Ruth E. Carter]] referenced the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Himba people|Himba]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Sotho people|Basotho]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Surma people|Suri]] and [[Dinka people|Dinka]] people in her designs.<ref name=\"CarterReferences\" /><ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" /> She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer [[Issey Miyake]], French fashion designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], and American fashion designer [[Donna Karan]].<ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" /> [[Winnie Mandela]] provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" />\n\nThe Dora Milaje costumes primarily used red to reflect different African cultures, and included beaded tabards that feature talismans that would be passed down from mother to daughter. Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on [[samurai]], five percent on [[ninja]]s, and five percent on the [[Ifugao people]] from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the [[Southern Ndebele people]] and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nThe costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a [[kente cloth]] cloak with military boots.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /><ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.<ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" />\n\nHair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] had begun by January 21, 2017,<ref name=\"Freeman\" /><!-- Specific date source needed when available --> at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" /> under the working title ''Motherland''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"Busan\" /> Filming also took place in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the [[High Museum of Art]], which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and [[Atlanta City Hall]], which served as a United Nations building.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on ''Black Panther'' after working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'',<ref name=\"Arri\" /> first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from ''Civil War'' so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> She filmed in 3.4K [[ArriRaw]] with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]] cameras and [[Panavision]] Primo lenses,<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel [[LED]] light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an [[iPad]]. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.<ref name=\"Arri\" />\n\nShortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,<ref name=\"KanisConfirmed\" /> while on-set photographs revealed that [[Martin Freeman]] would reprise his role as [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref name=\"Freeman\" /> Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise his role as [[Ulysses Klaue]] from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWJan2017\" /><ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use \"Wakandan accents\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|22}} Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Since ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in ''Infinity War''.<ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" />\n\nAdditional filming took place in South Korea,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> with the city of [[Busan]] serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.<ref name=\"Busan\" /><ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), taking the best elements from each for ''Black Panther''{{'}}s sequence.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> Filming in Busan began on March 17,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> at the [[Jagalchi Fish Market]].<ref name=\"JagalchiFishMarket\" /> Filming moved to [[Gwangalli Beach]] on March 21,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> with other South Korean filming locations including [[Marine City, Busan|Marine City]] in the [[Haeundae District]] and at the [[Gwangandaegyo]] Bridge.<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /><!-- while a Korean actor was expected to be cast for the film.<ref name=\"Busan\" />--> with additional location shooting also taking place at the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"Africanews\" /> John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"MarzanoFilms\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.<ref name=\"WrightShuri\" /> Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.<ref name=\"VultureApril2017\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\n==== Editing ====\n''Black Panther'' was edited by Michael Shawver and [[Debbie Berman]], with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in ''Black Panther'' throughout the editing process for ''Homecoming'' after first seeing the character in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on ''Creed'' to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" /> During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" />\n\nAs first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> the film includes two [[post-credit scene]]s: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring [[Sebastian Stan]] reprising his role as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]].<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" /> In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]], but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesET\" /> Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of ''Civil War'') because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Wakanda in film.jpg|thumb|[[Previsualization]] (top) and completed visual effects shot of Wakanda by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (bottom)]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and [[Scanline VFX]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; Mammal Studios; [[Method Studios]]; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xii-xx}}<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> [[Previsualization]] was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xi}} Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nComparing ''Black Panther'' to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use lots of steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like [[One Central Park]] in [[Sydney]] and [[The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala|The Pearl of Africa Hotel]] in [[Kampala]], but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]], with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a {{convert|3600|km2|abbr=on}} landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on [[CAD]] models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuideBlog\" /> Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\".

And they did.\"<ref name=\"Slate_Review\" /> Although praising the film itself and calling it a \"refreshing answer to the increasingly stale world of superhero cinema\", Devindra Hardawar at [[Engadget]] was critical of the CGI, notably the digital actors used, calling them \"weightless, ugly and, worst of all, incredibly distracting\". Hardawar felt two \"particularly disappointing\" CGI shots were when T'Challa flips over a car during the Korea chase, and when T'Challa and Killmonger punch each other as they fall within the vibranium mines.<ref name=\"EngadgetCGI\" />\n\n=== Analysis ===\n==== Cultural importance ====\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left||bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=Many have wondered why ''Black Panther'' means so much to the black community and why schools, churches and organizations have come to the theaters with so much excitement. The answer is that the movie brings a moment of positivity to a group of people often not the centerpiece of Hollywood movies... [Racial and ethnic socialization] helps to strengthen identity and helps reduce the likelihood on internalizing negative stereotypes about one's ethnic group.|source=\u2014Erlanger Turner, assistant professor of Psychology at the [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]]<ref name=\"TurnerHoustonChronicle\" />}}\n\nWriting for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Jamil Smith felt ''Black Panther'' would \"prove to Hollywood that African-American narratives have the power to generate profits from all audiences\", and described it as a resistance to \"a regressive cultural and political moment fueled in part by the white-nativist movement... Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition.\"<ref name=\"TimeFeb2018\" /> Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, ''Black Panther'' \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said ''Black Panther'' was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's ''[[A Raisin in the Sun (1961 film)|A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"Connolly\" /> Writer and activist [[Shaun King]] found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to [[Rosa Parks]]' [[Montgomery bus boycott]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, or [[2008 United States presidential election|Barack Obama being elected president]].<ref name=\"King\" />\n\nBy contrast, James Wilt, writing for ''[[Canadian Dimension]]'', stated that \"at its core, ''Black Panther'' contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates [[respectability politics]] over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel {{em|extremely comfortable}} watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\".<ref name=\"Wilt\" /> Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\".<ref name=\"Rickford\" /> Faisal Kutty from [[Middle East Eye]] felt the film had underlying [[Islamophobic]] themes, with the only Islamic characters being a [[Boko Haram]]-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear [[hijab]].<ref name=\"MiddleEasternEye\" />\n\n[[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] Director for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]] and ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to ''Black Panther'' since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\",<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience.<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" />\n\nGil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects\".<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models.<ref name=\"GoFundMeTodayShow\" /> Scholar Marlene D. Allen felt the saying \"if you can see it, you can be it\" applied to the film, especially with the female characters in the film. Allen felt the women of Wakanda \"are the very definition of '[[Black Girl Magic]]', a term coined by CaShawn Thompson in 2013 'to celebrate the beauty, power, and resilience of Black women.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Allen\" /> Tre Johnson of ''Rolling Stone'' felt that \"after decades of trying to nail the modern black superhero, we may {{em|finally}} be getting what we've asked for\", with Johnson saying ''Black Panther'' felt different from the [[Blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s and the \"Blaxploitation-lite\" attempts at black superhero films in the 1990s and 2000s because it was \"respectable, imaginative and powerful\", setting \"a new direction\" for the depiction of black superheroes.<ref name=\"RollingStoneTrailer\" /> In the film's opening weekend, 37% of audiences in the United States were African-American, according to PostTrak, compared to 35% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, and 5% Asian.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> This was the most diverse audience for a superhero film ever (African-Americans generally make up 15% of audiences for superhero films).<ref name=\"THRMarketing\" /> In its second weekend, demographics were 37% Caucasian, 33% African American, 18% Hispanic and 7% Asian.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd2\" />\n\nIn early January 2018, philanthropist Frederick Joseph created a [[GoFundMe]] drive to raise money for children of color at the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] in [[Harlem]] to see ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"GoFundMeRoots\" /> Joseph said the film was a \"rare opportunity\" for underserved children of color to see \"see a black major ... comic book character\" brought to film.<ref name=\"GoFundMeTodayShow\" /> Joseph promoted the drive with Boseman on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. The drive went on to raise over $45,000,<ref name=\"GoFundMeGuardian\" /> exceeding its goal,<ref name=\"GoFundMeRoots\" /> with the money also funding other programs for children in Harlem.<ref name=\"GoFundMeGuardian\" /> Joseph also started the \"Black Panther Challenge\" where he encouraged other people to create similar drives for their communities.<ref name=\"GoFundMeRoots\" /> GoFundMe made a centralized site for those wishing to start a drive for the challenge.<ref name=\"GoFundMeVibe\" /> 400 additional drives were started around the world, and the overall drive became the largest GoFundMe in history for an entertainment event, raising over $400,000.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> Many celebrities offered their support and contributions to the drives,<ref name=\"GoFundMeRoots\" /> including [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Chelsea Clinton]], [[J. J. Abrams]],<ref name=\"GoFundMeGuardian\" /> [[Octavia Spencer]],<ref name=\"SpencerTheater\" /> and British actress [[Jade Anouka]].<ref name=\"GoFundMeGuardian\" />\n\nIn June 2018, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] announced they had acquired several items from the film for their collection, including Boseman's Black Panther costume and a shooting script for the film signed by Coogler, Feige, Moore, and Cole. The museum said that the collection provides a \"fuller story of black culture and identity\" by showing the progression of black Americans in film, \"an industry that [once] regulated them to flat, one-dimensional and marginalized figures.\"<ref name=\"NMAAHCCollection\" /> In conjunction with ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program, and its partner the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]], Walt Disney Studios created \"The ''Black Panther'' Scholarship\", worth {{USD}}250,000 to [[Loyola Marymount University]]. Boseman, Nyong'o, and Gurira presented the scholarship to its first recipient at ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s 2018 Women in Entertainment event in early December 2018.<ref name=\"BlackPantherScholarship\" />\n\n==== African and African-American representation ====\nDwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in ''[[HuffPost]]'' saw the film and its comic origins as addressing \"serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves\", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders. He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of [[colonialism]] did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\".<ref name=\"Omowale\" /> Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of ''Bam! Smack! Pow!'' said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\".<ref name=\"Gonzalez\" /> Jelani Cobb, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that ''Black Panther'' is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\"<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> Writing for ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', [[Adam Serwer]] argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"''Black Panther'' does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberation\u2014to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"<ref name=\"Serwer\" />\n\n[[Patrick Gathara]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which\u2014rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"\u2014offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\"<ref name=\"Gathara\" /> Christopher Lebron, in a piece for ''[[Boston Review]]'', called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a president <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Donald Trump]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American\".<ref name=\"Lebron\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)}}\n''Black Panther'' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning three),<ref name=\"Oscars1\" /> one [[American Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"AMA18\" /> nine [[BET Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"BET\" /> one [[Billboard Music Award]],<ref name=\"Billboard nod\" /> one [[British Academy Film Award]] (won),<ref name=\"Bafa\" /> twelve [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning three),<ref name=\"CCA19\" /> three [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref name=\"GoldenGlobeNoms\" /> eight [[Grammy Award]]s (winning two),<ref name=\"GAN19\" /> seven [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]] (winning four),<ref name=\"Mtv\" /> one [[MTV Video Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"MTVVMA18\" /> sixteen [[NAACP Image Awards]] (winning ten),<ref name=\"naacp\" /> five [[E!

Its nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] were firsts for a superhero film,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /><ref name=\"GoldenGlobeSuperheroFilm\" /> while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film.<ref name=\"MCUFirstOscar\" /> ''Black Panther'' was named one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[National Board of Review]] as well as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"NationalBoardTopTen\" /><ref name=\"AFITopTen\" /> The film was the top entertainment Google search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.<ref name=\"GoogleTop2018Searches\" />\n\n==== Oscars campaign ====\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the [[91st Academy Awards]], with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new [[Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film|Best Popular Film]] award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like ''Black Panther''\" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it.<ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardDeadline\" /><ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardTHR\" /> Glenn Whipp of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's best picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters ''Black Panther'' \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if ''Black Panther'' could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> A few weeks later, Disney revealed their [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]] list, with consideration in all [[Academy Awards#Awards of Merit categories|Awards of Merit categories]], aside from [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.<ref name=\"FYCListEW\" /><ref name=\"FYCListJoBlo\" />\n\n''Black Panther'' was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].<ref name=\"Oscars2019\" /> The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" /> Feige called the best picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\".<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the eighteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Ryan Coogler]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Joe Robert Cole]], and stars <!-- Order per this source: https://news.marvel.com/movies/58647/marvel-studios-begins-production-black-panther-2/ -->[[Chadwick Boseman]] as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside [[Michael B.

In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] was hired to write a script in January 2011. ''Black Panther'' was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making ''Black Panther'' the first Marvel film with a predominantly [[Black film|black cast]]. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], and [[Busan]], South Korea.\n\n''Black Panther'' premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16. The film received praise from critics for its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, though the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3&nbsp;billion worldwide and broke numerous [[List of Black Panther box office achievements|box office records]], including the highest-grossing film by a [[Black people|black]] director. It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->highest-grossing film]] of all time, the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|third-highest-grossing film]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2018]].\n\nThe film received numerous [[List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)|awards and nominations]], with seven nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with wins for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. ''Black Panther'' is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination, and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], two wins at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and twelve nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning three), among others.<!-- Please note.

One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of [[Wakanda]]. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a [[Third World]] country. In 1992, Wakanda's King [[T'Chaka]] visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in [[Oakland, California]]. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue]] with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. \n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" />}} his son [[T'Challa]] returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice [[Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] with his recuperation.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Black Panther cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|(L:R) Producer [[Kevin Feige]], director [[Ryan Coogler]], and actors [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Michael B.

Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\".<ref name=\"CooglerVulture\" /> The film was also inspired by the comic runs of [[Jack Kirby]], [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), [[Jonathan Hickman]], and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.<ref name=\"ComingSoonSDCC\" /> The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Coogler had hoped to include [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kraven the Hunter]] early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available.<ref name=\"Kraven\" /> [[Donald Glover]] and his brother [[Stephen Glover (screenwriter)|Stephen]] made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]].<ref name=\"Glover\" /> Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was [[storyboard]]ed before being cut.<ref name=\"MooreHuffPostMay2018\" />\n\nFeige described ''Black Panther'' as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /> with ''Civil War'' laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> He also said the film would be a cross between ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\".<ref name=\"EWCoverJuly2017\" /> Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film ''[[A Prophet]]'' (2009) for inspiration.<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to [[Donald Trump]] becoming [[President of the United States]] after [[Barack Obama]], though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\"<ref name=\"EWBosemanJuly2017\" /> Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"FeigeGenreDescription\" /> ''Civil War'' did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the [[Xhosa language]], which Boseman was taught by [[John Kani]] who portrays T'Challa's father King [[T'Chaka]].<ref name=\"Xhosa\" /> Additional actors portraying Wakandans in ''Black Panther'' learned the language,<ref name=\"Nyongo/Film\" /> with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son [[Atandwa Kani|Atandwa]] served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.<ref name=\"NYTimesXhosa\" />\n\n==== Design ====\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,<ref name=\"Cole2\" /> rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\".<ref name=\"ColeAug2016\" /> Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country [[Lesotho]], a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly [[British colonization of Africa|colonized by the British]];<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /><ref name=\"LesothoVulture\" /> the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /> Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral [[coltan]] that can almost only be found in Congo.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,<ref name=\"NoManApe\" /> and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionDesign\" />\n\n===== Sets =====\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], pulling inspiration from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Ethiopia]],<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> as well as the designs of [[Zaha Hadid]],<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic [[Mali Empire]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].<ref name=\"CooglerTimbuktu\" /> Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a [[love letter]] to Africa.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern [[Afro-punk]] style of the Golden City, the capital.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> [[Rondavel]]s were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at [[Blyde River Canyon]] in South Africa.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" />\n\nBeachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by [[Lesotho]], the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on [[Nigerian]] writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|15}} including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the [[stainless steel]] look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the [[maglev]] and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the [[Congo peafowl]].<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" />\n\nThe majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the [[Oribi Gorge]]. The set was {{convert|36|ft}}, made up of a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|spell=in}} pool, and then {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} cliff faces that were designed to be extended to {{convert|100|ft}} with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with {{convert|25000|ft3}} of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===== Costumes =====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Masaai-women.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Dora Milaje in film.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The [[Maasai people]] of Kenya (top) inspired about 80% of the design of the [[Dora Milaje]], Wakanda's all-female special forces (bottom).<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nCostume designer [[Ruth E.

Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on [[samurai]], five percent on [[ninja]]s, and five percent on the [[Ifugao people]] from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the [[Southern Ndebele people]] and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nThe costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a [[kente cloth]] cloak with military boots.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /><ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.<ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" />\n\nHair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] had begun by January 21, 2017,<ref name=\"Freeman\" /><!-- Specific date source needed when available --> at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" /> under the working title ''Motherland''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"Busan\" /> Filming also took place in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the [[High Museum of Art]], which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and [[Atlanta City Hall]], which served as a United Nations building.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on ''Black Panther'' after working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'',<ref name=\"Arri\" /> first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from ''Civil War'' so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> She filmed in 3.4K [[ArriRaw]] with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]] cameras and [[Panavision]] Primo lenses,<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel [[LED]] light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an [[iPad]]. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.<ref name=\"Arri\" />\n\nShortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,<ref name=\"KanisConfirmed\" /> while on-set photographs revealed that [[Martin Freeman]] would reprise his role as [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref name=\"Freeman\" /> Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise his role as [[Ulysses Klaue]] from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWJan2017\" /><ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use \"Wakandan accents\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|22}} Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Since ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in ''Infinity War''.<ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" />\n\nAdditional filming took place in South Korea,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> with the city of [[Busan]] serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.<ref name=\"Busan\" /><ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), taking the best elements from each for ''Black Panther''{{'}}s sequence.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> Filming in Busan began on March 17,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> at the [[Jagalchi Fish Market]].<ref name=\"JagalchiFishMarket\" /> Filming moved to [[Gwangalli Beach]] on March 21,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> with other South Korean filming locations including [[Marine City, Busan|Marine City]] in the [[Haeundae District]] and at the [[Gwangandaegyo]] Bridge.<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /><!-- while a Korean actor was expected to be cast for the film.<ref name=\"Busan\" />--> with additional location shooting also taking place at the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"Africanews\" /> John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"MarzanoFilms\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.<ref name=\"WrightShuri\" /> Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.<ref name=\"VultureApril2017\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\n==== Editing ====\n''Black Panther'' was edited by Michael Shawver and [[Debbie Berman]], with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in ''Black Panther'' throughout the editing process for ''Homecoming'' after first seeing the character in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on ''Creed'' to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" /> During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" />\n\nAs first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> the film includes two [[post-credit scene]]s: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring [[Sebastian Stan]] reprising his role as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]].<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" /> In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]], but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesET\" /> Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of ''Civil War'') because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Wakanda in film.jpg|thumb|[[Previsualization]] (top) and completed visual effects shot of Wakanda by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (bottom)]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and [[Scanline VFX]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; Mammal Studios; [[Method Studios]]; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xii-xx}}<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> [[Previsualization]] was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xi}} Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nComparing ''Black Panther'' to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use lots of steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like [[One Central Park]] in [[Sydney]] and [[The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala|The Pearl of Africa Hotel]] in [[Kampala]], but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]], with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a {{convert|3600|km2|abbr=on}} landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on [[CAD]] models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuideBlog\" /> Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room \"proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels\" that \"pulse and ripple\". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and \"layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos\", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.<ref name=\"PerceptionCaseStudy\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Black Panther (soundtrack)}}\nAfter reading the script, composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson decided to go to Africa to do research for the film.<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /> He spent a month in Senegal, first traveling around with musician [[Baaba Maal]] on his tour,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"SongExploder\" /> and then spending several weeks working with local musicians to form the \"base\" of his score.<ref name=\"GoranssonSDCC\" /><ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> G\u00f6ransson was particularly drawn to the [[talking drum]] and the [[tambin]], or [[Fula people|Fula]] flute, to use in his character themes,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"GoranssonTIFF\" /> along with [[Brass instruments|horns]].<ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> Nate Moore compared the work G\u00f6ransson did in defining the sound of the film to the use of music by [[James Gunn]] in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' films,<ref name=\"MooreCineworld\" /> with the composer pushing Marvel out of their comfort zone.<ref name=\"Soundtracking\" />\n\n[[Kendrick Lamar]] produced the film's curated soundtrack, ''Black Panther: The Album'', along with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his \"artistic themes align with those we explore in the film\".<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of \"top-billing names\" under Top Dawg Entertainment.<ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> G\u00f6ransson collaborated with Lamar and producer [[Sounwave]] on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"AUReviewOpps\" /> Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: \"[[All the Stars]]\",<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /> \"[[King's Dead]]\",<ref name=\"KingsDead\" /> and \"[[Pray for Me (The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar song)|Pray for Me]]\".<ref name=\"PrayForMe\" /> ''Black Panther: The Album'' was released on February 9, 2018,<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018\" /> while a soundtrack of G\u00f6ransson's score was released on February 16.<ref name=\"ScoreAlbumRelease\" /> An [[extended play]] titled ''Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed'', featuring remixes of five cues from G\u00f6ransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018. G\u00f6ransson worked with several other artists to create the remixes.<ref name=\"RemixEP\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nMarvel debuted early footage and [[concept art]] from the film at a press event in April 2017.

Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition.\"<ref name=\"TimeFeb2018\" /> Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, ''Black Panther'' \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said ''Black Panther'' was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's ''[[A Raisin in the Sun (1961 film)|A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"Connolly\" /> Writer and activist [[Shaun King]] found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to [[Rosa Parks]]' [[Montgomery bus boycott]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, or [[2008 United States presidential election|Barack Obama being elected president]].<ref name=\"King\" />\n\nBy contrast, James Wilt, writing for ''[[Canadian Dimension]]'', stated that \"at its core, ''Black Panther'' contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates [[respectability politics]] over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel {{em|extremely comfortable}} watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\".<ref name=\"Wilt\" /> Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\".<ref name=\"Rickford\" /> Faisal Kutty from [[Middle East Eye]] felt the film had underlying [[Islamophobic]] themes, with the only Islamic characters being a [[Boko Haram]]-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear [[hijab]].<ref name=\"MiddleEasternEye\" />\n\n[[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] Director for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]] and ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to ''Black Panther'' since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\",<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience.<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" />\n\nGil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects\".<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models.<ref name=\"GoFundMeTodayShow\" /> Scholar Marlene D.

He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of [[colonialism]] did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\".<ref name=\"Omowale\" /> Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of ''Bam! Smack! Pow!'' said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\".<ref name=\"Gonzalez\" /> Jelani Cobb, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that ''Black Panther'' is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\"<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> Writing for ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', [[Adam Serwer]] argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"''Black Panther'' does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberation\u2014to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"<ref name=\"Serwer\" />\n\n[[Patrick Gathara]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which\u2014rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"\u2014offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\"<ref name=\"Gathara\" /> Christopher Lebron, in a piece for ''[[Boston Review]]'', called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a president <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Donald Trump]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American\".<ref name=\"Lebron\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)}}\n''Black Panther'' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning three),<ref name=\"Oscars1\" /> one [[American Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"AMA18\" /> nine [[BET Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"BET\" /> one [[Billboard Music Award]],<ref name=\"Billboard nod\" /> one [[British Academy Film Award]] (won),<ref name=\"Bafa\" /> twelve [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning three),<ref name=\"CCA19\" /> three [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref name=\"GoldenGlobeNoms\" /> eight [[Grammy Award]]s (winning two),<ref name=\"GAN19\" /> seven [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]] (winning four),<ref name=\"Mtv\" /> one [[MTV Video Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"MTVVMA18\" /> sixteen [[NAACP Image Awards]] (winning ten),<ref name=\"naacp\" /> five [[E!

Its nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] were firsts for a superhero film,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /><ref name=\"GoldenGlobeSuperheroFilm\" /> while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film.<ref name=\"MCUFirstOscar\" /> ''Black Panther'' was named one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[National Board of Review]] as well as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"NationalBoardTopTen\" /><ref name=\"AFITopTen\" /> The film was the top entertainment Google search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.<ref name=\"GoogleTop2018Searches\" />\n\n==== Oscars campaign ====\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the [[91st Academy Awards]], with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new [[Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film|Best Popular Film]] award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like ''Black Panther''\" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it.<ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardDeadline\" /><ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardTHR\" /> Glenn Whipp of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's best picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters ''Black Panther'' \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if ''Black Panther'' could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> A few weeks later, Disney revealed their [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]] list, with consideration in all [[Academy Awards#Awards of Merit categories|Awards of Merit categories]], aside from [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.<ref name=\"FYCListEW\" /><ref name=\"FYCListJoBlo\" />\n\n''Black Panther'' was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].<ref name=\"Oscars2019\" /> The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" /> Feige called the best picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\".<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible.\"<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\nWith the release of ''Black Panther'', Feige said \"there are many, many stories to tell\" about the character, and that he wanted Coogler to return for any potential sequel.<ref name=\"FeigeFuture\" /> Coogler added that he wanted to see how T'Challa would grow as a king in future films, since his reign only began recently in the MCU, while in the comics, he has been king since childhood.<ref name=\"ScreenRantFeb2018\" /> In March 2018, Feige added there was \"nothing specific to reveal\" in terms of a sequel, but that there \"absolutely\" were \"ideas and a pretty solid direction on where we want to head with the second one\".<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> By October 2018, Coogler had completed a deal to write and direct a sequel to ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel\" /> On November 1, 2018, Coogler said that, while he's feeling pressure while developing the sequel due to ''Black Panther''{{'}}s success, he will \"focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning\" for the film.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel2\" /> On June 30, 2019, producer [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that work on the script had begun.<ref name=\"FeigeSequel\" /> Wright, Gurira, and Freeman will reprise their roles in the film.<ref name=\"WrightSequel\" /><ref name=\"GuriraSequel\" /><ref name=\"FreemanSequel\" /> In July 2019, Feige confirmed the film is currently in development.<ref name=\"ScreenRant\" /> The film is scheduled to be released on May 6, 2022.<ref name=\"D232019\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Afrofuturism in film]]\n* [[List of black film box office receipts]]\n* [[List of black films of the 2010s]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist |group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"CarrJun92\">{{Cite news|title=Can penguin cones be far behind?|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=June 21, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CarrAug92\">{{Cite news|title=Tolkin to sit in director's chair|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 30, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PersallAug93\">{{Cite news|title=Future is bright for Snipes|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=August 3, 1993|last=Persall|first=Steve}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BrodieJan94\">{{Cite news|title=Hollywood Pours Its Heroes into Tights|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 5, 1994|last=Brodie|first=John}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PittsMar94\">{{Cite news|title=A comics milestone from the action-filled universe of superheroes come new characters, and a new diversity|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=March 27, 1994|last=Pitts, Jr.|first=Leonard|authorlink=Leonard Pitts|page=J1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LoveceMay94\">{{Cite news|title=Off the drawing board|work=[[Newsday]]|date=May 15, 1994|last=Lovece|first=Frank}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NyeJan96\">{{Cite news|title=Stan Lee hopes New World deal pumps life into his creations|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|date=January 28, 1996|last=Nye|first=Doug}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DawesJul97\">{{Cite news|title=Action!

Tollner was the son of Charles Tollner, the founder of the hardware store that subsequently became  [[Hammacher Schlemmer]] under the ownership of Eugene Tollner's cousin William Schlemmer.

The Deweys bought the entire building in 1923 and continued to run the business until 1985.

In 1880, Eugene Tollner joined him and the restaurant became known as Gage and Tollner's in 1882. Tollner was the son of Charles Tollner, the founder of the hardware store that subsequently became  [[Hammacher Schlemmer]] under the ownership of Eugene Tollner's cousin William Schlemmer. The restaurant moved to 372\u2013374 Fulton Street in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tipsontables.com/GageandTollner.html|title=Gage and Tollner's of Brooklyn, 1956 Review|website=Tipsontables.com}}</ref>\n\nIt attracted customers like [[Diamond Jim Brady]], [[Jimmy Durante]] and [[Mae West]].<ref name=\"bklynr.com\">{{cite web|url=http://bklynr.com/empty-places/|title=Bklynr \u2013 Empty Places|website=Bklynr.com}}</ref>\n\nGage and Tollner retired in 1911 and sold the restaurant to A.H. Cunningham and Alexander Ingalls, with the provision that neither the interior nor the name be changed. They sold the restaurant eight years later to Seth Bradford Dewey. The Deweys bought the entire building in 1923 and continued to run the business until 1985. Despite the ownership changes, Charles Gage and Eugene Tollner continued to work at the restaurant until their deaths in 1920 and 1935, respectively.<ref>\"Eugene Tollner, Noted Cafe Man, Dies here at 83.\" ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''.

Four Denver parks, Aspgren, Huston Lake, Vanderbilt Park and Habitat Park are within the boundaries of Athmar Park. The eastern half of the neighborhood is lower in [[elevation]] than the west, with a sharp rise above the river beginning near Pecos Street and continuing the gradual climb in elevation toward the southwest. In contrast to the older grid-type streets found in many neighborhoods, Athmar Park has some streets that have long, flowing curves.\n\nOne of Colorado's busiest [[Department of Motor Vehicles|driver's license offices]] is located in the neighborhood at 1865-C West Mississippi Avenue.<ref>[http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&blobheadername2=MDT-Type&blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D975%2F14%2FDR+2337web_secured+2-2-11.pdf&blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1251694674015&ssbinary=true Colorado Driver's Handbook, p. 33 ]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2000, the [[racial]] breakdown of Athmar Park was 29.52% [[Caucasian race|White]], 0.84% [[African American]], 0.43% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], 3.15% [[Asian people|Asian]], and 65.21% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]].<ref>http://www.piton.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=CommunityFacts.Summary&Neighborhood_ID=860</ref>\n\nThe publication of the 2010 [[United States Census]], with a total population of 8,898, showed small changes in race and [[ethnicity]] with the population at 63% White or Hispanic/Latino, with 73% of that number claiming Hispanic ethnicity and 27% listing non-Hispanic ethnicity.

Until 2011, Habitat Park was the location of the Denver Municipal Animal shelter, which moved to a site in the [[Valverde, Denver|Valverde]] neighborhood to the north of Athmar Park.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, Athmar Park was [[Annexation|annexed]] incrementally by the City of Denver. In 1902, the eastern edge of Athmar Park was annexed, along with the town of Valverde, from Zuni to the South Platte River border. In 1932, the area west of Zuni was annexed by the City of Denver. The area west of the town of Valverde, that had originally been in the hands of three different owners, was [[Auction|auctioned]] and purchased by Thomas and John R. McCusker in 1946 and developed into the subdivision of Denver named \"Athmar Park\".<ref>[http://www.neighborhoodlink.com/pdf/nhextra/341355182/991912840/640993083.pdf Athmar Park Perimeter Plan]</ref> According to urban legend, the name \"Athmar\" originated from the combination of the names of the developers' two wives, Athea and Mary.\n\nIn 1900, the northeast area of the neighborhood was [[rural]] and contained [[celery]] farms and wheat fields. Several of the original brick country homes still exist on W. Nevada Place, dating from the late 1880s to the early 1900s. 1395 W. Nevada Place dates to the late 1880s, and 1597 W. Nevada Place dates to 1912.\n\nThe northwest portion of the neighborhood was originally called Mountainview. Many of the charming brick [[Bungalow|bungalows]] in this area of the neighborhood, each with a unique design, date from the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAfter World War II, there was a major housing boom during which a large number of the neighborhood \"tract\" homes were built.\n\nDenver's first [[McDonald's]] restaurant was located in the neighborhood, at 2120 W. Alameda Avenue. The building is still there but hosts a different restaurant.\n\nThe neighborhood was affected by a destructive [[flood]] in June 1965 when the S. Platte River flooded outside its banks. Flood waters reached up to the basketball hoops at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church school (1345 W. Dakota Ave.). Flood waters engulfed homes and businesses from the river all the way west into the 1400 blocks of the neighborhood. \"The flooding along the South Platte River from Plum Creek to [[North Platte, Nebraska]] was the most destructive. The flood reached the South Platte River and the metropolitan areas of Denver by about 8 p.m. on June 16. The floodwaters spread to a half-mile or more in width. The peak discharge of the South Platte at Denver was 183 percent of the previous maximum during 67 years of record and historical information indicates that the 1965 discharge was the greatest since at least 1844. Many business, homes, industries, roads and highways were inundated. About 8,000 telephones were put out of service by the flood in the Denver area. More than half of these lines were not restored for several days.\n\nThe [[Denver metropolitan area]] suffered extensive damage. The flood zone represented 67 percent of the industrial area in the city. While the flood passed rather quickly on the night of June 16, the floodwaters were piled high with debris such as house trailers, lumber and large [[butane]] storage tanks. Many of the bridges in the downtown area became plugged with debris and were washed out when they could no longer withstand the pressure. Other bridges held, but sustained excessive erosion damage. The floodwaters left behind several feet of mud and debris all along the South Platte flood plain. In Denver, the cleanup job took several months and cost the city over $1 million.<ref>[http://www.assessment.ucar.edu/flood/flood_summaries/06_14_1965.html South Platte & Arkansas Basins: June 14-20, 1965], The Weather and Climate Assessment Science Program</ref> [[Chatfield Reservoir]] was built in response to the 1965 flood.\n\nAthmar Park is the site of a branch [[library]]. Until 1999, the library was housed in a small storefront in the Athmar Shopping Center (1865 W. Mississippi Avenue). In 1999, the library was relocated into a remodeled stone building, formerly a church, located at the corner of West Mississippi Avenue and South Tejon Street at 1055 South Tejon Street. The Athmar branch library has a [[Robert Mangold]] wind sculpture that was formerly located at the [[Denver Art Museum]].\n\nThe neighborhood has six mosaic games tables created as a public art project by area residents and school children. The game tables are intended to provide gathering places and encourage interaction between area residents. Three mosaic game tables are located at Huston Lake Park and three in Aspgren Park. The game boards include chess, checkers and backgammon boards. They are surrounded by themed mosaics.\n\nAt Huston Lake there are:\n\n:A mosaic [[quilt]] patch table commemorates the ladies of the Valverde [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] who gathered every Tuesday for over 40 years to create quilts for the less fortunate\n:A mosaic flower table created by Valverde Elementary school children\n:A mosaic view of the mountains from Huston Lake created by neighborhood residents.

Alameda Avenue, was developed in 1959 as Denver's first outdoor [[Shopping mall|mall]]. When first constructed, the mall included a [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] dime store, a [[bowling alley]], a furniture store and doctor offices. The very popular [[Organ Grinder Restaurant|Organ Grinder]] pizza parlor, with its famous two story organ, was located at the center. By 1990, the center was past its prime and declared a blighted site. The center was redeveloped by Brighton Corporation in 2009-11. A public art installation, \"Geese\", was created by the Colorado sculptor Fred Lunger as part of the project.\n\n==Education==\n{{see|Category:Schools in Denver}}\nAthmar Park is unique in Denver neighborhoods in that six separate schools<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpsk12.org/schoollist/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204115547/http://www.dpsk12.org/schoollist/default.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> serve the community at large:\n* Goldrick Elementary (Mississippi & Zuni)\n* Valverde Elementary (Alameda & Tejon)\n* KIPP Sunshine Peak Academy (375 S.

It consists mostly of all-brick [[Ranch-style house|ranches]] and [[bungalow]]-style homes built in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Athmar Park, Denver, Colorado.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Mississippi Avenue at left marks the southern border of the neighborhood. At right is one of the Colorado driver's license offices.]]\nAthmar Park is bordered by Alameda Avenue on the north, Mississippi Avenue on the south, [[Colorado State Highway 88|Federal Boulevard]] on the west and the [[South Platte River]] on the east. Four Denver parks, Aspgren, Huston Lake, Vanderbilt Park and Habitat Park are within the boundaries of Athmar Park. The eastern half of the neighborhood is lower in [[elevation]] than the west, with a sharp rise above the river beginning near Pecos Street and continuing the gradual climb in elevation toward the southwest. In contrast to the older grid-type streets found in many neighborhoods, Athmar Park has some streets that have long, flowing curves.\n\nOne of Colorado's busiest [[Department of Motor Vehicles|driver's license offices]] is located in the neighborhood at 1865-C West Mississippi Avenue.<ref>[http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&blobheadername2=MDT-Type&blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D975%2F14%2FDR+2337web_secured+2-2-11.pdf&blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1251694674015&ssbinary=true Colorado Driver's Handbook, p. 33 ]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2000, the [[racial]] breakdown of Athmar Park was 29.52% [[Caucasian race|White]], 0.84% [[African American]], 0.43% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], 3.15% [[Asian people|Asian]], and 65.21% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]].<ref>http://www.piton.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=CommunityFacts.Summary&Neighborhood_ID=860</ref>\n\nThe publication of the 2010 [[United States Census]], with a total population of 8,898, showed small changes in race and [[ethnicity]] with the population at 63% White or Hispanic/Latino, with 73% of that number claiming Hispanic ethnicity and 27% listing non-Hispanic ethnicity. Residents with Asian (3.5%), American Native (2.1%) and African American ethnicity (1.4%) make the remainder of the non-Hispanic population with 30% of them considering themselves \"other\" or \"mixed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013222920/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ |archivedate=October 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Parks==\n===Huston Lake Park===\nHuston Lake Park is located in the center of the Athmar Park neighborhood between the streets of South Clay and South Vallejo, and the avenues of West Ohio and West Kentucky.

Huston, the park was originally the site of a patch of [[Swamp|swampland]] called \"Frenchie's Lake\" which was used by early residents as a location to [[Ice skating|ice skate]] in the winter and swim in the summer.\n\n===Clifford Aspgren Park===\nLocated at the eastern edge of the residential areas of Athmar Park, Clifford Aspgren park was named after a resident who served in the [[Colorado House of Representatives]].\n\n===Vanderbilt Lake Park===\nVanderbilt Lake Park contains both Habitat Park and Boy Scout Park and is part of the larger South Platte River Greenway.<ref>Catlett, Sharon R., ''Farmlands, Forts, and Country Life. The Story of Southwest Denver.'' 2007 {{ISBN|1-56579-545-8}}</ref> It contains a sports fields complex and is part of a series of parks connected by the South Platte River biking and walking trail system. Until 2011, Habitat Park was the location of the Denver Municipal Animal shelter, which moved to a site in the [[Valverde, Denver|Valverde]] neighborhood to the north of Athmar Park.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, Athmar Park was [[Annexation|annexed]] incrementally by the City of Denver. In 1902, the eastern edge of Athmar Park was annexed, along with the town of Valverde, from [[Zuni, Colorado|Zuni]] to the South Platte River border. In 1932, the area west of Zuni was annexed by the City of Denver. The area west of the town of Valverde, that had originally been in the hands of three different owners, was [[Auction|auctioned]] and purchased by Thomas and John R. McCusker in 1946 and developed into the subdivision of Denver named \"Athmar Park\".<ref>[http://www.neighborhoodlink.com/pdf/nhextra/341355182/991912840/640993083.pdf Athmar Park Perimeter Plan]</ref> According to urban legend, the name \"Athmar\" originated from the combination of the names of the developers' two wives, Athea and Mary.\n\nIn 1900, the northeast area of the neighborhood was [[rural]] and contained [[celery]] farms and wheat fields. Several of the original brick country homes still exist on W. Nevada Place, dating from the late 1880s to the early 1900s. 1395 W. Nevada Place dates to the late 1880s, and 1597 W. Nevada Place dates to 1912.\n\nThe northwest portion of the neighborhood was originally called Mountainview. Many of the charming brick [[Bungalow|bungalows]] in this area of the neighborhood, each with a unique design, date from the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAfter World War II, there was a major housing boom during which a large number of the neighborhood \"tract\" homes were built.\n\nDenver's first [[McDonald's]] restaurant was located in the neighborhood, at 2120 W. Alameda Avenue. The building is still there but hosts a different restaurant.\n\nThe neighborhood was affected by a destructive [[flood]] in June 1965 when the S. Platte River flooded outside its banks. Flood waters reached up to the basketball hoops at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church school (1345 W. Dakota Ave.). Flood waters engulfed homes and businesses from the river all the way west into the 1400 blocks of the neighborhood. \"The flooding along the South Platte River from Plum Creek to [[North Platte, Nebraska]] was the most destructive. The flood reached the South Platte River and the metropolitan areas of Denver by about 8 p.m. on June 16. The floodwaters spread to a half-mile or more in width. The peak discharge of the South Platte at Denver was 183 percent of the previous maximum during 67 years of record and historical information indicates that the 1965 discharge was the greatest since at least 1844. Many business, homes, industries, roads and highways were inundated. About 8,000 telephones were put out of service by the flood in the Denver area. More than half of these lines were not restored for several days.\n\nThe [[Denver metropolitan area]] suffered extensive damage. The flood zone represented 67 percent of the industrial area in the city. While the flood passed rather quickly on the night of June 16, the floodwaters were piled high with debris such as house trailers, lumber and large [[butane]] storage tanks. Many of the bridges in the downtown area became plugged with debris and were washed out when they could no longer withstand the pressure. Other bridges held, but sustained excessive erosion damage. The floodwaters left behind several feet of mud and debris all along the South Platte flood plain. In Denver, the cleanup job took several months and cost the city over $1 million.<ref>[http://www.assessment.ucar.edu/flood/flood_summaries/06_14_1965.html South Platte & Arkansas Basins: June 14-20, 1965], The Weather and Climate Assessment Science Program</ref> [[Chatfield Reservoir]] was built in response to the 1965 flood.\n\nAthmar Park is the site of a branch [[library]]. Until 1999, the library was housed in a small storefront in the Athmar Shopping Center (1865 W. Mississippi Avenue). In 1999, the library was relocated into a remodeled stone building, formerly a church, located at the corner of West Mississippi Avenue and South Tejon Street at 1055 South Tejon Street. The Athmar branch library has a [[Robert Mangold]] wind sculpture that was formerly located at the [[Denver Art Museum]].\n\nThe neighborhood has six mosaic games tables created as a public art project by area residents and school children. The game tables are intended to provide gathering places and encourage interaction between area residents. Three mosaic game tables are located at Huston Lake Park and three in Aspgren Park. The game boards include chess, checkers and backgammon boards. They are surrounded by themed mosaics.\n\nAt Huston Lake there are:\n\n:A mosaic [[quilt]] patch table commemorates the ladies of the Valverde [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] who gathered every Tuesday for over 40 years to create quilts for the less fortunate\n:A mosaic flower table created by Valverde Elementary school children\n:A mosaic view of the mountains from Huston Lake created by neighborhood residents. The well-known Colorado oil painter and neighborhood resident, Brenda Hendrix, created the overall design of the mountain view table\n:\n\nAt Aspgren Park there are:\n\n:A mosaic commemorating the 1965 flood\n:A mosaic all about \"love\"\n:A modern design mosaic.\n:\n\nAlameda Square Shopping Center, located at 2200 W. Alameda Avenue, was developed in 1959 as Denver's first outdoor [[Shopping mall|mall]]. When first constructed, the mall included a [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] dime store, a [[bowling alley]], a furniture store and doctor offices. The very popular [[Organ Grinder Restaurant|Organ Grinder]] pizza parlor, with its famous two story organ, was located at the center. By 1990, the center was past its prime and declared a blighted site. The center was redeveloped by Brighton Corporation in 2009-11. A public art installation, \"Geese\", was created by the Colorado sculptor Fred Lunger as part of the project.\n\n==Education==\n{{see|Category:Schools in Denver}}\nAthmar Park is unique in Denver neighborhoods in that six separate schools<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpsk12.org/schoollist/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204115547/http://www.dpsk12.org/schoollist/default.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> serve the community at large:\n* Goldrick Elementary (Mississippi & Zuni)\n* Valverde Elementary (Alameda & Tejon)\n* KIPP Sunshine Peak Academy (375 S.

The fifth season premiered on 2 March 2017.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode included detailed reenactments of the events leading up to the murder and the murder itself. Sections of these reenactments are then shown throughout the episode to refresh the viewer's memory of the events.\n\nThe producers state that the psychics are given no information about the case other than a photo, which some psychics prefer to keep face-down (The idea being that the less information they have, the better their supernormal abilities function). Other psychics choose to look at the photograph. To demonstrate their abilities, the psychics relay their impressions about the case/person which may match details in the case file.\n\nThe psychics are then asked to provide any extra information they can using their psychic abilities.\n\nThe show's private detective hosts the next section, in which he is asked to try to investigate any new leads suggested by the psychics and sometimes talk to the families of the deceased.\n\n==Format origin==\nThe program format was developed by Danish Nordisk Film TV<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egmont.com/Press/Press+Releases/Sensing+Murder+an+Export+Success.htm |title=Sensing Murder an Export Success |date=17 May 2002 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301041735/http://www.egmont.com/Press/Press+Releases/Sensing+Murder+an+Export+Success.htm |archivedate=1 March 2009 }}</ref> and has been sold to many countries.

(As claimed during each aired episode.)

Sections of these reenactments are then shown throughout the episode to refresh the viewer's memory of the events.\n\nThe producers state that the psychics are given no information about the case other than a photo, which some psychics prefer to keep face-down (The idea being that the less information they have, the better their supernormal abilities function). Other psychics choose to look at the photograph. To demonstrate their abilities, the psychics relay their impressions about the case/person which may match details in the case file.\n\nThe psychics are then asked to provide any extra information they can using their psychic abilities.\n\nThe show's private detective hosts the next section, in which he is asked to try to investigate any new leads suggested by the psychics and sometimes talk to the families of the deceased.\n\n==Format origin==\nThe program format was developed by Danish Nordisk Film TV<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egmont.com/Press/Press+Releases/Sensing+Murder+an+Export+Success.htm |title=Sensing Murder an Export Success |date=17 May 2002 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301041735/http://www.egmont.com/Press/Press+Releases/Sensing+Murder+an+Export+Success.htm |archivedate=1 March 2009 }}</ref> and has been sold to many countries.
