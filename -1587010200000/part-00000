In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor.

It is located at the intersection of [[Newbury Street]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] near the western end of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The station is named for the [[Hynes Convention Center]], which is located about {{convert|700|feet}} to the east along [[Boylston Street]]. It has two [[side platform]]s serving the two tracks of the [[Boylston Street Subway]], which are used by the Green Line [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B Branch]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C Branch]], and [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D Branch]]. The main entrance to the station from Massachusetts Avenue leads to a fare lobby under the [[360 Newbury Street]] building.\n\nConstruction of the station (originally named Massachusetts) began in December 1912; it opened in October 1914 along with the Boylston Street Subway for use by the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy). Construction on a surface-level transfer station for streetcars on Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue began in April 1918 and was completed the following November. These surface routes were gradually [[bustitution|replaced by buses]] from the 1930s to the 1960s. The transfer station was closed in January 1963 due to construction of the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike Extension]]; it was partially demolished.\n\nThe newly-created MBTA renamed the station Auditorium in 1965, followed by Hynes Convention Center/ICA in 1990 and finally Hynes Convention Center in 2006. A pedestrian tunnel to the southbound bus shelter was opened in 1964, and the Boylston Street entrance was reopened in 1965. Both were closed in the 1980s, though the Boylston Street entrance is still used during the [[Boston Marathon]] and major events at the convention center.\n\nAveraging just under 9,000 weekday boardings in a 2013 count, Hynes is the busiest non-[[accessible]] MBTA station. A renovation to the station, planned as part of [[air rights]] development over the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], will make the station accessible and reopen the Boylston Street entrance at all times. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of $45.7 million. A separate development project is proposed to include restoration of the pedestrian tunnel.\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Hynes Convention Center station layout 2020.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of the station layout. The underground platforms and tracks are in green, with the fare lobbies above in yellow, and surface-level corridors in orange. Unused corridors to the southbound bus shelter and the former surface station are in blue.|alt=See caption.]]\nThe station is oriented approximately east\u2013west; it lies oblique to the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] street grid inside the block bounded by Massachusetts Avenue on the southwest, Newbury Street on the northwest, Hereford Street on the northeast, and Boylston Street on the southeast. Just east (inbound) of the station, the [[Boylston Street Subway]] curves slightly to the north to run under Boylston Street; to the west, a curve slightly to the south aligns the tunnel under Newbury Street.<ref name=btc1912 />\n\nThe station has two [[side platform]]s serving the line's two tracks.

It is located at the intersection of [[Newbury Street]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] near the western end of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The station is named for the [[Hynes Convention Center]], which is located about {{convert|700|feet}} to the east along [[Boylston Street]]. It has two [[side platform]]s serving the two tracks of the [[Boylston Street Subway]], which are used by the Green Line [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B Branch]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C Branch]], and [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D Branch]]. The main entrance to the station from Massachusetts Avenue leads to a fare lobby under the [[360 Newbury Street]] building.\n\nConstruction of the station (originally named Massachusetts) began in December 1912; it opened in October 1914 along with the Boylston Street Subway for use by the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy). Construction on a surface-level transfer station for streetcars on Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue began in April 1918 and was completed the following November. These surface routes were gradually [[bustitution|replaced by buses]] from the 1930s to the 1960s. The transfer station was closed in January 1963 due to construction of the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike Extension]]; it was partially demolished.\n\nThe newly-created MBTA renamed the station Auditorium in 1965, followed by Hynes Convention Center/ICA in 1990 and finally Hynes Convention Center in 2006. A pedestrian tunnel to the southbound bus shelter was opened in 1964, and the Boylston Street entrance was reopened in 1965. Both were closed in the 1980s, though the Boylston Street entrance is still used during the [[Boston Marathon]] and major events at the convention center.\n\nAveraging just under 9,000 weekday boardings in a 2013 count, Hynes is the busiest non-[[accessible]] MBTA station. A renovation to the station, planned as part of [[air rights]] development over the adjacent [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], will make the station accessible and reopen the Boylston Street entrance at all times. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of $45.7 million. A separate development project is proposed to include restoration of the pedestrian tunnel.\n\n==Station layout==\n[[File:Hynes Convention Center station layout 2020.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of the station layout. The underground platforms and tracks are in green, with the fare lobbies above in yellow, and surface-level corridors in orange.

In late March, the state directed all people to voluntarily stay at home as much as possible.
