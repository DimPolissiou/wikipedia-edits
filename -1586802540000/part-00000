The original club was formed in 1984 and formerly competed in the [[Super League]]. The new, current club was formed in 2000 following a merger of the old club with [[Huddersfield Giants]]. The old club's biggest achievement was winning the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. The Eagles are the current holders of the 1895 Cup, after they beat Widnes Vikings at Wembley Stadium on 24 August.\n\n== History ==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== 1982\u20131984: Foundation of original Eagles ===\nIn 1982, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] captain and chairman of the Players' Union, [[Gary Hetherington]], missed out on a coaching job at [[York F.C.]]. He decided to form his own club in Sheffield. The original plan to enter the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] in 1983\u201384 fell apart when [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] pulled back from their promise to let the new team play its home games at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\nThe club eventually joined the Second Division in 1984, coached by [[Alan Rhodes (rugby league)|Alan Rhodes]], they played at the [[Owlerton Stadium]]. A competition was run in the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' newspaper to find a name for the new club and \"Sheffield Eagles\" was the winner. The first Eagles league game was on 2 September 1984 when they beat [[Rochdale Hornets]], 29\u201310. The match took place the day after the club's sponsor went bust. Hetherington was both manager and player in the first season, building the team using experienced players from traditional areas. He also began signing up promising young players, one of whom was [[Mark Aston]], later to be a critical part of the Eagles' survival as a club and current head coach.\n\nBy November the club was close to folding because of financial problems. Sheffield beat [[Wakefield Trinity]] to set up a John Player Special Trophy first round tie against [[Leeds Rhinos]]. This lucrative game generated enough cash to see out the season.\n\n===1985\u20131998: Progress and Challenge Cup win===\nOn the field the club progressed steadily, improving their league position until in 1988/89 they finished third in the league table and made it to the Second Division Premiership final at [[Old Trafford]]. In the final they outplayed [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], beating them by 43\u201318 and gaining promotion to the top flight of [[rugby league]]. Sheffield's record attendance at Owlerton was set at 3,636 for a third-round Challenge Cup game against [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] in 1989.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], stadium safety became an issue in British sport and Owlerton was declared unfit to stage professional rugby league. Eagles were forced to play their home games at seven different venues including [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] itself, [[Bramall Lane]], [[Recreation Ground (Chesterfield)|Recreation Ground]], [[Oakwell Stadium]] and [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. They survived one season in the top flight but were then relegated. This was a temporary decline as they immediately regained their place in the First Division, winning the Second Division title and Premiership. The Eagles slowly established themselves as a top flight club.\n\n[[Don Valley Stadium]] became home for the club in September 1990, it had been built for the 1991 [[World Student Games]] held in Sheffield. In May 1991, Eagles signed their first local recruit, Jason Davidson. In 1992 they reached the Yorkshire Cup final, losing to [[Wakefield Trinity]].\n\nBill Gardner became coach in July 1993 season replacing Gary Hetherington who stood down from his coaching role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-broncos-man-to-coach-eagles-2321276.html|title=Rugby League: Broncos man to coach Eagles|author=|date=6 May 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> In December following a run of five defeats, he was sacked and Hetherington took over as coach again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-gardner-takes-leave-of-sheffield-1466189.html|title=Rugby League: Gardner takes leave of Sheffield|author=|date=8 December 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSheffield was included on the schedule for a game against the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] during their [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] and were defeated, 80\u20132, in the first game following the first test match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. This was the highest score by a Kangaroo touring team in England since they had defeated [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], 92\u20137, on the [[1921\u201322 Kangaroo tour|1921\u201322 tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1921/game-16/bramley-vs-australia.html|title=Kangaroos Tour 1921 Series \u2013 Game 16 \u2013 Rugby League Project|first1=Shawn|last1=Dollin|first2=Andrew|last2=Ferguson|date=|work=RugbyLeagueProject.org|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> The Kangaroos ran in 14 tries to nil at Don Valley Stadium. However, because of the tie the club benefited from a significant financial gain.\n\nIn March 1995, Sheffield pulled out of a proposed merger with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] following a \"breach of confidentiality\"; Sheffield were then set to take-over 'The Dons' in a deal with administrators, which fell through after the [[Rugby Football League|RFL]] declared Doncaster players to be free agents.\n\nWhen a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-funded [[Super League]] competition was first proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Sheffield were again down to merge with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] to form a ''South Yorkshire'' club that would compete in Super League. This, along with other proposed mergers, were strongly opposed by supporters and never materialised. As ''Sheffield Eagles'' the club became a founder member of Super League in 1996 and took part in the first game of the [[Super League]] era against [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]].\n\nIn November 1996, chief executive Gary Hetherington sold his controlling interest in Sheffield Eagles to take over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. [[Phil Larder]] became head coach, Paul Thompson, Chairman of Sheffield-based Sanderson Group Plc, became the majority shareholder, and Eagles plc became the first rugby league club to be floated on the Stock Exchange.\n\n[[John Kear]] took over the coaching reins at Sheffield Eagles in 1997, taking them to the Premiership Semi-final in that year. The club's record attendance was set in August 1997 when 10,603 spectators saw them play [[Bradford Bulls]].\n\nOn 2 May 1998, having beaten [[Leigh Centurions]], Egremont Rangers, [[Castleford Tigers]] and [[Salford Red Devils]], the Eagles faced [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the final of the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]]. Wigan were overwhelming favourites with a side containing some of the best players of the modern era, including [[Andy Farrell]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Henry Paul]]. Sheffield coach [[John Kear]] devised a game plan that was executed perfectly by the team on the day. Star of the show was [[Rugby league positions|scrum half]] [[Mark Aston]], who won the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] as man of the match. The Eagles led from start to finish, running out 17\u20138 winners in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.\n\n===Huddersfield\u2013Sheffield Giants ===\n\nJust as the club seemed to be on the verge of its greatest period, following the win in the cup final, things began to go wrong. The expected increase in attendances did not happen and the team did not perform well, finishing close to the [[relegation]] zone only one year after the Wembley triumph. Finances plummeted and with little outside help it became apparent that the Eagles were not viable in their current state. Just a year after performing the greatest upset in Challenge Cup history, the Eagles announced that they were to fold at the end of the season should no investors come on board to save the club.\n\nIn late 1999 the [[Rugby Football League]] wanted to lower the number of clubs in Super League. One of the measures they put in place was the option for two clubs to merge for the sum of \u00a31,000,000. Fearing this was the only way to keep rugby league alive in Sheffield, the club accepted an offer from the RFL to merge with another struggling team, the [[Huddersfield Giants]], making a new team Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, who were scheduled to play games in both [[Sheffield]] and [[Huddersfield]] in [[Super League V]]. The Huddersfield-Sheffield side's away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. The merged Huddersfield-Sheffield team did not last the season before reverting to the Huddersfield name. An immediately resurrected Sheffield Eagles would continue in the lower leagues.\n\n===2000\u20132005: 'New' Sheffield Eagles===\n\nThe merger with Huddersfield was not accepted by Sheffield supporters {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and so former player [[Mark Aston]] formed a new Eagles phoenix club, earning a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] for the 2000 season, taking [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]]'s vacated place.\n\nFrom 1999 to the present the Eagles have played in the [[Rugby League Championships|semi-professional leagues]], first the Northern Ford Premiership and then the second division of the [[Rugby League Championships|LHF Healthplan National League]]. [[Mark Aston]] assumed the role of player manager, continuing on the field until 2004, when he officially retired from playing. After the 2004 season Mark replaced his father Brian as chief executive, bringing in a new head coach in [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] at the end of the following year. As soon as the new club was reformed, it vowed to never overstretch its finances to achieve success. This made life difficult as the Eagles were denied the money received by other clubs in the NFP for TV rights as part of the deal that allowed them to re-enter the professional leagues.\n\n2003 brought two club records; Sheffield suffered their record defeat on 2 February 2003 0\u201388 to [[Hull F.C.]] However, on 3 August 2003, [[London Skolars]] were the victims as Sheffield Eagles won 98\u20134, a record league victory to this day. In 2003 the team finished top of National League Two and reached the Grand Final, agonisingly losing 13\u201311 to the [[Keighley Cougars]]. Victory would have sent the Eagles into National League One, but this was not to be and a second play-off against the [[Batley Bulldogs]] ended in failure for the demoralised squad.\n\n===2006\u20132008: Promotion===\nUntil 2006 the team struggled to match this effort, with key players retiring or being signed by bigger clubs \u2013 young players [[Mitch Stringer|Mitchell Stringer]] and [[Andy Raleigh]] went on to sign for [[Super League]] clubs. At the start of the 2006 season [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] was brought in as coach and the team finished in second place, qualifying for the play-offs for the right to join champions [[Dewsbury Rams]] in National League One. On 22 September 2006 they beat the [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] to qualify for the Grand Final for a second time. In the Grand Final on 8 October they beat [[Swinton Lions]] 35\u201310 to be promoted to National League One. To the surprise of many Wilkinson resigned as head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons. National League One was seen as a springboard to a potential return to Super League, although this would be dependent on the RFL's continuation of the [[franchising]] or [[licensing]] system.  As Sheffield Eagles' chairman Ian Swire, remarked, after the 2006 Grand Final victory, \"We showed on Sunday that we can compete, and that in the near- to not-too-distant future we will get back into Super League\".\n\nMark Aston returned as coach in 2007. The 2007 season started slowly for the promoted team but ended with the Eagles defying the bookmakers, who had them as favourites for relegation, by finishing 6th in the league table and qualifying for the play-offs, where they lost a close game to [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].\n\n===2009\u20132012: Move to Bramall Lane===\nIn 2009 National League 1 was renamed the Co-operative Championship. The 2009 season started unevenly with incoming International players delayed by visa problems. However, the Eagles rallied to progress to the 5th round of the Challenge Cup and produced consistent performances, gaining at least a losing bonus point from all their League games. Despite a number of long-term injuries, the team finished 3rd only narrowly missing out on 2nd place; their highest finish since the re-launch, and they again qualified for the play-offs. In the play-offs they were expected to easily beat [[Featherstone Rovers]] in the first match at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. However, Rovers surprised many by winning, ending Sheffield's season at the first play-off hurdle.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, the Eagles announced they would be moving their home games from the start of the 2010 season to [[Bramall Lane]], home of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in a bid to increase attendances and atmosphere at games which now take place on Sunday afternoons. The Eagles moved to Bramall Lane on 11 April 2010, losing by 40\u201316 to Featherstone Rovers. The attendance of 2,871 was 3 times the average the Eagles achieved at Don Valley Stadium and the club hope to push on from there to achieve a [[Super League]] licence. The 2010 season saw the club finish in 6th place, making the play-offs and surprising both [[Leigh Centurions]] and [[Barrow Raiders]] with away victories before falling to eventual champions [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the Eagles most successful to date, reaching the semi finals of the [[Northern Rail Cup]] for the first time and beating Featherstone Rovers 20\u201316 in the Grand Final to become Championship Champions. The final was a re-match of the 2011 fixture which was the Eagles 1st ever appearance at the final but were beaten soundly on that occasion 40\u20134. The Eagles defeated [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]], [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] to reach the Grand Final with [[Scott Turner (rugby league)|Scott Turner]], [[Misi Taulapapa]], [[Quentin Laulu-Togagae]] and [[Dane McDonald]] all scoring for the Eagles to bring the trophy back to Sheffield.\n\nThe Eagles played 3 home games at Bramall Lane in 2012 with the rest taking place at Don Valley including a crowd on 1,895 watching the opening league game against [[Swinton Lions]] at Don Valley, the Eagles' highest crowd there since the [[Super League]] era.\n\n===2013\u20132017: Post Don Valley===\nThe 2013 season was equally if not more successful that the previous season, reaching the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the first time, losing to [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] at [[the Shay]], but more importantly becoming the first side to win back to back Championship Grand Finals by beating [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 19\u201312 at [[Leigh Sports Village]] to retain the Championship title.\n\nThe Eagles moved back to [[Owlerton Stadium]] for the 2014 season as the Don Valley Stadium was scheduled for demolition. The Eagles planned to play at the new [[Sheffield Hallam University]] facility at Bawtry Road but unfortunately this was not possible and Owlerton Stadium stepped in at the last minute. Sheffield Eagles announced that they would leave Owlerton for the 2015 season due to new [[Rugby Football League]] ground regulations and played the season in nearby [[Doncaster]] at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], home of [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].\n\nIn 2016 it was announced the Eagles would play at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]'s Sports Park. The first league game played by the professional team there was against [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and they won 26\u20136.\n\nIn 2017, the club agreed a one-year ground share with [[Wakefield Trinity]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. The club also returned to being a semi-professional outfit after an unsuccessful time as professional.\n\n===2018\u2013present: Permanent return to Sheffield===\nThe Eagles made their long-awaited return to [[Sheffield|their home city]] at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympiclegacypark.co.uk/news/2017/10/sheffield-eagles-return-home|title=Sheffield Eagles return home|date=5 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The new stadium has a 4G pitch and a capacity of 1,889, although this is expected to increase to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations. The first home game back in [[Sheffield]] was against [[Toronto Wolfpack]] on 11 March, they lost 10\u201344. Ahead of [[2018 RFL Championship|this season]] players [[Greg Burns (rugby league)|Greg Burns]], [[Matt James (rugby league)|Matt James]] and [[Ryan Millar (rugby league)|Ryan Millar]] agreed to sign on for a further two years. They struck a deal with [[Super League]] side [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] for players on [[Rugby League Dual registration|Dual registration]]; this helped bolster the squad throughout the season and was considered to be a huge contribution to keeping them in the division. After a seven game losing streak to open the season, the Eagles finally won, at home against [[Rochdale Hornets|Rochdale]] by 38 points to 20. The season, however, ended disappointingly as the Eagles finished eighth in the league with the greatest achievement being staying up.\n\nIn 2019, however, things were looking up for the side as they brought in 14 new signings, including ex-Eagles [[Jason Crookes]], [[James Davey (rugby \nleague)|James Davey]] and [[Pat Walker (rugby league)|Pat Walker]], but lost key players in [[Joshua Toole]] (Forbes), [[Matty Fozard]] (London). They got off to a flying start as they overcame the challenges of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] and [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] in the first month of the new season. That year saw the Eagles return to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] for the first time in more than 2 decades to claim the inaugural [[1895 Cup]] by defeating [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 38\u201316.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49458365|title=Sheffield Eagles beat Widnes Vikings to win inaugural 1895 Cup|date=24 August 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> However, their League season was less of a success as they finished in 7th place.\n\nDuring the off-season, plans to build the Olympic Legacy Park were put into jeopardy as a court case to claim 100% ownership of [[Sheffield United F.C.]] found in favour of HRH Prince Abdullah bin Musa'ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud over [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] -one of the main investors to the OLP project for Sheffield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/prince-abdullah-wins-sheffield-united-ownership-battle-as-kevin-mccabe-considers-an-appeal-1-9997553|title=\nPrince Abdullah wins Sheffield United ownership battlel|date=16 September 2019|publisher=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> Because of this, there were fears that Mr McCabe would remove plans for his Scarborough Group LTD to head up construction of a new ground on the site at the OLP. However, these fears were quashed when it was revealed construction would go ahead as planned in early 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldeagles.com/club/new_stadium|title=\nShefield Eagles 'New Stadium'|date=27 September 2019 |publisher=Sheffield Eagles}}</ref>\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n===Colours===\nThe club adopted the colours of the original Sheffield Eagles, playing in red, gold and white. The club's shirts have been predominantly red with either a gold or white V across the front. Away shirts vary in colour with some being black or white. The 2020 home shirt is predominantly red, white and gold. The 2020 away kit is a gold and black strip, black shorts and black socks.\n\n===Badge===\n<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Sheffield-eagles.gif|right|150px]] -->\nThe original club's badge was an Eagles head inside a crest with ''The Eagles'' across the top and Sheffield Eagles in italics across the bottom. The inside of the crest was yellow with a red border. The new club chose to use a different more updated crest to replace the old dated one. The new more modern crest features an eagle with Sheffield Eagles written below it.\n\n==Stadiums==\nSheffield originally played at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. In a bid to increase attendances, the Eagles left Don Valley in 2010 and moved to [[Bramall Lane]] where attendances rose to three times more than what they were at Don Valley. The Eagles returned to Don Valley midway through 2011 and stayed there until 2013. Don Valley was demolished in 2014.\n\nAfter being left homeless the club moved to the city's greyhound track, [[Owlerton Stadium]] in [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] where they had previously played games between 1984\u20131989. The club experienced a dip in form at Owlerton, with there being temporary changing rooms and poor facilities.\n\nThe club moved out of Sheffield for the first time in 2015 when they made the temporary switch to the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], [[Doncaster]]. Here they ground shared with [[Doncaster Rovers]] and local rivals [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]], who were playing in the same division which meant the two clubs playing an extra home game when they faced each other. At the end of the [[RFL Championship|season]], during [[The Qualifiers]], the Eagles' were allowed to return to [[Bramall Lane]] for games against [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull K.R.]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. They also hosted [[Hull F.C.]] at the Lane, in a [[Challenge Cup]] fifth round tie.\n\nThe Eagles moved to Sheffield Hallam University's Sports Park on Bawtry Road, [[Brinsworth]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]] in 2016, where the reserves played their home fixtures. Temporary seating was erected to bring the capacity to 3,000 to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations.\n\nAfter finding themselves homeless again with work on the Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium delayed and unable to find a home in Sheffield, the Eagles played their home matches at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], the home of [[Wakefield Trinity]], for the duration of the 2017 season.\n\nThe club finally permanently returned to Sheffield and the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018. Work is due to start on the construction of a \u00a35million stadium in the spring of 2019.<ref name=\"Work to get under way on \u00a35 million stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/work-to-get-underway-on-5-million-stadium-which-will-give-sheffield-united-women-and-sheffield-eagles-a-home-1-9608903|title=Work to get under way on \u00a35 million stadium which will give Sheffield United Women and Sheffield Eagles a home|publisher=Sheffield Star|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n*[[Don Valley Stadium]] (1999\u20132009)\n*[[Bramall Lane]] (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Don Valley Stadium]] (2011\u20132013)\n*[[Owlerton Stadium]] (2014)\n*[[Keepmoat Stadium]] (2015)\n*[[Sheffield Hallam University]] Sports Park (2016)\n*[[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]] (2017)\n*[[Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium]] (2018\u2013present)\n\n==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

name=\"Operational Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby-league.com/operational-rules/|title=Operational Rules|publisher=RFL|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref> The club play their home games at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] (OLP) on the former site of [[Don Valley Stadium]], their former ground. The original club was formed in 1984 and formerly competed in the [[Super League]]. The new, current club was formed in 2000 following a merger of the old club with [[Huddersfield Giants]]. The old club's biggest achievement was winning the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. The Eagles are the current holders of the 1895 Cup, after they beat Widnes Vikings at Wembley Stadium on 24 August.\n\n== History ==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== 1982\u20131984: Foundation of original Eagles ===\nIn 1982, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] captain and chairman of the Players' Union, [[Gary Hetherington]], missed out on a coaching job at [[York F.C.]]. He decided to form his own club in Sheffield. The original plan to enter the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] in 1983\u201384 fell apart when [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] pulled back from their promise to let the new team play its home games at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\nThe club eventually joined the Second Division in 1984, coached by [[Alan Rhodes (rugby league)|Alan Rhodes]], they played at the [[Owlerton Stadium]]. A competition was run in the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' newspaper to find a name for the new club and \"Sheffield Eagles\" was the winner. The first Eagles league game was on 2 September 1984 when they beat [[Rochdale Hornets]], 29\u201310. The match took place the day after the club's sponsor went bust. Hetherington was both manager and player in the first season, building the team using experienced players from traditional areas. He also began signing up promising young players, one of whom was [[Mark Aston]], later to be a critical part of the Eagles' survival as a club and current head coach.\n\nBy November the club was close to folding because of financial problems. Sheffield beat [[Wakefield Trinity]] to set up a John Player Special Trophy first round tie against [[Leeds Rhinos]]. This lucrative game generated enough cash to see out the season.\n\n===1985\u20131998: Progress and Challenge Cup win===\nOn the field the club progressed steadily, improving their league position until in 1988/89 they finished third in the league table and made it to the Second Division Premiership final at [[Old Trafford]]. In the final they outplayed [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], beating them by 43\u201318 and gaining promotion to the top flight of [[rugby league]]. Sheffield's record attendance at Owlerton was set at 3,636 for a third-round Challenge Cup game against [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] in 1989.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], stadium safety became an issue in British sport and Owlerton was declared unfit to stage professional rugby league. Eagles were forced to play their home games at seven different venues including [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] itself, [[Bramall Lane]], [[Recreation Ground (Chesterfield)|Recreation Ground]], [[Oakwell Stadium]] and [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. They survived one season in the top flight but were then relegated. This was a temporary decline as they immediately regained their place in the First Division, winning the Second Division title and Premiership. The Eagles slowly established themselves as a top flight club.\n\n[[Don Valley Stadium]] became home for the club in September 1990, it had been built for the 1991 [[World Student Games]] held in Sheffield. In May 1991, Eagles signed their first local recruit, Jason Davidson. In 1992 they reached the Yorkshire Cup final, losing to [[Wakefield Trinity]].\n\nBill Gardner became coach in July 1993 season replacing Gary Hetherington who stood down from his coaching role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-broncos-man-to-coach-eagles-2321276.html|title=Rugby League: Broncos man to coach Eagles|author=|date=6 May 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> In December following a run of five defeats, he was sacked and Hetherington took over as coach again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-gardner-takes-leave-of-sheffield-1466189.html|title=Rugby League: Gardner takes leave of Sheffield|author=|date=8 December 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSheffield was included on the schedule for a game against the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] during their [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] and were defeated, 80\u20132, in the first game following the first test match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. This was the highest score by a Kangaroo touring team in England since they had defeated [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], 92\u20137, on the [[1921\u201322 Kangaroo tour|1921\u201322 tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1921/game-16/bramley-vs-australia.html|title=Kangaroos Tour 1921 Series \u2013 Game 16 \u2013 Rugby League Project|first1=Shawn|last1=Dollin|first2=Andrew|last2=Ferguson|date=|work=RugbyLeagueProject.org|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> The Kangaroos ran in 14 tries to nil at Don Valley Stadium. However, because of the tie the club benefited from a significant financial gain.\n\nIn March 1995, Sheffield pulled out of a proposed merger with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] following a \"breach of confidentiality\"; Sheffield were then set to take-over 'The Dons' in a deal with administrators, which fell through after the [[Rugby Football League|RFL]] declared Doncaster players to be free agents.\n\nWhen a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-funded [[Super League]] competition was first proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Sheffield were again down to merge with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] to form a ''South Yorkshire'' club that would compete in Super League. This, along with other proposed mergers, were strongly opposed by supporters and never materialised. As ''Sheffield Eagles'' the club became a founder member of Super League in 1996 and took part in the first game of the [[Super League]] era against [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]].\n\nIn November 1996, chief executive Gary Hetherington sold his controlling interest in Sheffield Eagles to take over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. [[Phil Larder]] became head coach, Paul Thompson, Chairman of Sheffield-based Sanderson Group Plc, became the majority shareholder, and Eagles plc became the first rugby league club to be floated on the Stock Exchange.\n\n[[John Kear]] took over the coaching reins at Sheffield Eagles in 1997, taking them to the Premiership Semi-final in that year. The club's record attendance was set in August 1997 when 10,603 spectators saw them play [[Bradford Bulls]].\n\nOn 2 May 1998, having beaten [[Leigh Centurions]], Egremont Rangers, [[Castleford Tigers]] and [[Salford Red Devils]], the Eagles faced [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the final of the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]]. Wigan were overwhelming favourites with a side containing some of the best players of the modern era, including [[Andy Farrell]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Henry Paul]]. Sheffield coach [[John Kear]] devised a game plan that was executed perfectly by the team on the day. Star of the show was [[Rugby league positions|scrum half]] [[Mark Aston]], who won the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] as man of the match. The Eagles led from start to finish, running out 17\u20138 winners in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.\n\n===Huddersfield\u2013Sheffield Giants ===\n\nJust as the club seemed to be on the verge of its greatest period, following the win in the cup final, things began to go wrong. The expected increase in attendances did not happen and the team did not perform well, finishing close to the [[relegation]] zone only one year after the Wembley triumph. Finances plummeted and with little outside help it became apparent that the Eagles were not viable in their current state. Just a year after performing the greatest upset in Challenge Cup history, the Eagles announced that they were to fold at the end of the season should no investors come on board to save the club.\n\nIn late 1999 the [[Rugby Football League]] wanted to lower the number of clubs in Super League. One of the measures they put in place was the option for two clubs to merge for the sum of \u00a31,000,000. Fearing this was the only way to keep rugby league alive in Sheffield, the club accepted an offer from the RFL to merge with another struggling team, the [[Huddersfield Giants]], making a new team Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, who were scheduled to play games in both [[Sheffield]] and [[Huddersfield]] in [[Super League V]]. The Huddersfield-Sheffield side's away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. The merged Huddersfield-Sheffield team did not last the season before reverting to the Huddersfield name. An immediately resurrected Sheffield Eagles would continue in the lower leagues.\n\n===2000\u20132005: 'New' Sheffield Eagles===\n\nThe merger with Huddersfield was not accepted by Sheffield supporters {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and so former player [[Mark Aston]] formed a new Eagles phoenix club, earning a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] for the 2000 season, taking [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]]'s vacated place.\n\nFrom 1999 to the present the Eagles have played in the [[Rugby League Championships|semi-professional leagues]], first the Northern Ford Premiership and then the second division of the [[Rugby League Championships|LHF Healthplan National League]]. [[Mark Aston]] assumed the role of player manager, continuing on the field until 2004, when he officially retired from playing. After the 2004 season Mark replaced his father Brian as chief executive, bringing in a new head coach in [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] at the end of the following year. As soon as the new club was reformed, it vowed to never overstretch its finances to achieve success. This made life difficult as the Eagles were denied the money received by other clubs in the NFP for TV rights as part of the deal that allowed them to re-enter the professional leagues.\n\n2003 brought two club records; Sheffield suffered their record defeat on 2 February 2003 0\u201388 to [[Hull F.C.]] However, on 3 August 2003, [[London Skolars]] were the victims as Sheffield Eagles won 98\u20134, a record league victory to this day. In 2003 the team finished top of National League Two and reached the Grand Final, agonisingly losing 13\u201311 to the [[Keighley Cougars]]. Victory would have sent the Eagles into National League One, but this was not to be and a second play-off against the [[Batley Bulldogs]] ended in failure for the demoralised squad.\n\n===2006\u20132008: Promotion===\nUntil 2006 the team struggled to match this effort, with key players retiring or being signed by bigger clubs \u2013 young players [[Mitch Stringer|Mitchell Stringer]] and [[Andy Raleigh]] went on to sign for [[Super League]] clubs. At the start of the 2006 season [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] was brought in as coach and the team finished in second place, qualifying for the play-offs for the right to join champions [[Dewsbury Rams]] in National League One. On 22 September 2006 they beat the [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] to qualify for the Grand Final for a second time. In the Grand Final on 8 October they beat [[Swinton Lions]] 35\u201310 to be promoted to National League One. To the surprise of many Wilkinson resigned as head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons. National League One was seen as a springboard to a potential return to Super League, although this would be dependent on the RFL's continuation of the [[franchising]] or [[licensing]] system.  As Sheffield Eagles' chairman Ian Swire, remarked, after the 2006 Grand Final victory, \"We showed on Sunday that we can compete, and that in the near- to not-too-distant future we will get back into Super League\".\n\nMark Aston returned as coach in 2007. The 2007 season started slowly for the promoted team but ended with the Eagles defying the bookmakers, who had them as favourites for relegation, by finishing 6th in the league table and qualifying for the play-offs, where they lost a close game to [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].\n\n===2009\u20132012: Move to Bramall Lane===\nIn 2009 National League 1 was renamed the Co-operative Championship. The 2009 season started unevenly with incoming International players delayed by visa problems. However, the Eagles rallied to progress to the 5th round of the Challenge Cup and produced consistent performances, gaining at least a losing bonus point from all their League games. Despite a number of long-term injuries, the team finished 3rd only narrowly missing out on 2nd place; their highest finish since the re-launch, and they again qualified for the play-offs. In the play-offs they were expected to easily beat [[Featherstone Rovers]] in the first match at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. However, Rovers surprised many by winning, ending Sheffield's season at the first play-off hurdle.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, the Eagles announced they would be moving their home games from the start of the 2010 season to [[Bramall Lane]], home of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in a bid to increase attendances and atmosphere at games which now take place on Sunday afternoons. The Eagles moved to Bramall Lane on 11 April 2010, losing by 40\u201316 to Featherstone Rovers. The attendance of 2,871 was 3 times the average the Eagles achieved at Don Valley Stadium and the club hope to push on from there to achieve a [[Super League]] licence. The 2010 season saw the club finish in 6th place, making the play-offs and surprising both [[Leigh Centurions]] and [[Barrow Raiders]] with away victories before falling to eventual champions [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the Eagles most successful to date, reaching the semi finals of the [[Northern Rail Cup]] for the first time and beating Featherstone Rovers 20\u201316 in the Grand Final to become Championship Champions. The final was a re-match of the 2011 fixture which was the Eagles 1st ever appearance at the final but were beaten soundly on that occasion 40\u20134. The Eagles defeated [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]], [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] to reach the Grand Final with [[Scott Turner (rugby league)|Scott Turner]], [[Misi Taulapapa]], [[Quentin Laulu-Togagae]] and [[Dane McDonald]] all scoring for the Eagles to bring the trophy back to Sheffield.\n\nThe Eagles played 3 home games at Bramall Lane in 2012 with the rest taking place at Don Valley including a crowd on 1,895 watching the opening league game against [[Swinton Lions]] at Don Valley, the Eagles' highest crowd there since the [[Super League]] era.\n\n===2013\u20132017: Post Don Valley===\nThe 2013 season was equally if not more successful that the previous season, reaching the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the first time, losing to [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] at [[the Shay]], but more importantly becoming the first side to win back to back Championship Grand Finals by beating [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 19\u201312 at [[Leigh Sports Village]] to retain the Championship title.\n\nThe Eagles moved back to [[Owlerton Stadium]] for the 2014 season as the Don Valley Stadium was scheduled for demolition. The Eagles planned to play at the new [[Sheffield Hallam University]] facility at Bawtry Road but unfortunately this was not possible and Owlerton Stadium stepped in at the last minute. Sheffield Eagles announced that they would leave Owlerton for the 2015 season due to new [[Rugby Football League]] ground regulations and played the season in nearby [[Doncaster]] at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], home of [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].\n\nIn 2016 it was announced the Eagles would play at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]'s Sports Park. The first league game played by the professional team there was against [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and they won 26\u20136.\n\nIn 2017, the club agreed a one-year ground share with [[Wakefield Trinity]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. The club also returned to being a semi-professional outfit after an unsuccessful time as professional.\n\n===2018\u2013present: Permanent return to Sheffield===\nThe Eagles made their long-awaited return to [[Sheffield|their home city]] at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympiclegacypark.co.uk/news/2017/10/sheffield-eagles-return-home|title=Sheffield Eagles return home|date=5 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The new stadium has a 4G pitch and a capacity of 1,889, although this is expected to increase to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations. The first home game back in [[Sheffield]] was against [[Toronto Wolfpack]] on 11 March, they lost 10\u201344. Ahead of [[2018 RFL Championship|this season]] players [[Greg Burns (rugby league)|Greg Burns]], [[Matt James (rugby league)|Matt James]] and [[Ryan Millar (rugby league)|Ryan Millar]] agreed to sign on for a further two years. They struck a deal with [[Super League]] side [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] for players on [[Rugby League Dual registration|Dual registration]]; this helped bolster the squad throughout the season and was considered to be a huge contribution to keeping them in the division. After a seven game losing streak to open the season, the Eagles finally won, at home against [[Rochdale Hornets|Rochdale]] by 38 points to 20. The season, however, ended disappointingly as the Eagles finished eighth in the league with the greatest achievement being staying up.\n\nIn 2019, however, things were looking up for the side as they brought in 14 new signings, including ex-Eagles [[Jason Crookes]], [[James Davey (rugby \nleague)|James Davey]] and [[Pat Walker (rugby league)|Pat Walker]], but lost key players in [[Joshua Toole]] (Forbes), [[Matty Fozard]] (London). They got off to a flying start as they overcame the challenges of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] and [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] in the first month of the new season. That year saw the Eagles return to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] for the first time in more than 2 decades to claim the inaugural [[1895 Cup]] by defeating [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 38\u201316.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49458365|title=Sheffield Eagles beat Widnes Vikings to win inaugural 1895 Cup|date=24 August 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> However, their League season was less of a success as they finished in 7th place.\n\nDuring the off-season, plans to build the Olympic Legacy Park were put into jeopardy as a court case to claim 100% ownership of [[Sheffield United F.C.]] found in favour of HRH Prince Abdullah bin Musa'ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud over [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] -one of the main investors to the OLP project for Sheffield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/prince-abdullah-wins-sheffield-united-ownership-battle-as-kevin-mccabe-considers-an-appeal-1-9997553|title=\nPrince Abdullah wins Sheffield United ownership battlel|date=16 September 2019|publisher=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> Because of this, there were fears that Mr McCabe would remove plans for his Scarborough Group LTD to head up construction of a new ground on the site at the OLP. However, these fears were quashed when it was revealed construction would go ahead as planned in early 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldeagles.com/club/new_stadium|title=\nShefield Eagles 'New Stadium'|date=27 September 2019 |publisher=Sheffield Eagles}}</ref>\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n===Colours===\nThe club adopted the colours of the original Sheffield Eagles, playing in red, yellow and white. The club's shirts have been predominantly red with either a yellow or white V across the front. Away shirts vary in colour with some being black or white. The 2020 home shirt is predominantly red, white and gold. The 2020 away kit is a gold and black strip, black shorts and black socks.\n\n===Badge===\n<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Sheffield-eagles.gif|right|150px]] -->\nThe original club's badge was an Eagles head inside a crest with ''The Eagles'' across the top and Sheffield Eagles in italics across the bottom. The inside of the crest was yellow with a red border. The new club chose to use a different more updated crest to replace the old dated one. The new more modern crest features an eagle with Sheffield Eagles written below it.\n\n==Stadiums==\nSheffield originally played at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. In a bid to increase attendances, the Eagles left Don Valley in 2010 and moved to [[Bramall Lane]] where attendances rose to three times more than what they were at Don Valley. The Eagles returned to Don Valley midway through 2011 and stayed there until 2013. Don Valley was demolished in 2014.\n\nAfter being left homeless the club moved to the city's greyhound track, [[Owlerton Stadium]] in [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] where they had previously played games between 1984\u20131989. The club experienced a dip in form at Owlerton, with there being temporary changing rooms and poor facilities.\n\nThe club moved out of Sheffield for the first time in 2015 when they made the temporary switch to the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], [[Doncaster]]. Here they ground shared with [[Doncaster Rovers]] and local rivals [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]], who were playing in the same division which meant the two clubs playing an extra home game when they faced each other. At the end of the [[RFL Championship|season]], during [[The Qualifiers]], the Eagles' were allowed to return to [[Bramall Lane]] for games against [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull K.R.]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. They also hosted [[Hull F.C.]] at the Lane, in a [[Challenge Cup]] fifth round tie.\n\nThe Eagles moved to Sheffield Hallam University's Sports Park on Bawtry Road, [[Brinsworth]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]] in 2016, where the reserves played their home fixtures. Temporary seating was erected to bring the capacity to 3,000 to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations.\n\nAfter finding themselves homeless again with work on the Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium delayed and unable to find a home in Sheffield, the Eagles played their home matches at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], the home of [[Wakefield Trinity]], for the duration of the 2017 season.\n\nThe club finally permanently returned to Sheffield and the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018. Work is due to start on the construction of a \u00a35million stadium in the spring of 2019.<ref name=\"Work to get under way on \u00a35 million stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/work-to-get-underway-on-5-million-stadium-which-will-give-sheffield-united-women-and-sheffield-eagles-a-home-1-9608903|title=Work to get under way on \u00a35 million stadium which will give Sheffield United Women and Sheffield Eagles a home|publisher=Sheffield Star|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n*[[Don Valley Stadium]] (1999\u20132009)\n*[[Bramall Lane]] (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Don Valley Stadium]] (2011\u20132013)\n*[[Owlerton Stadium]] (2014)\n*[[Keepmoat Stadium]] (2015)\n*[[Sheffield Hallam University]] Sports Park (2016)\n*[[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]] (2017)\n*[[Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium]] (2018\u2013present)\n\n==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
