He has kidnapped dozens of school girls and plans to use them as suicide bombers to bomb populated areas in India. He even puts some girls into the personal harem, pushing the remaining ones into prostitution and trafficks their limbs and organs for money. He is also responsible for murdering the chief of Indian army, General Sinha (Parikshit Sahani). One day, while out for a seaside trip with his daughter, Major Krishna Rao, an officer in the Indian Army, happens to notice an island with his daughter and they find a schoolgirl escaping someone. they try to take her on the boat, but she dies. Then leaving Dolly with his trusted servant, Major Rao himself creeps forward and sees Dong ordering his men to do away with those kids. He calls Dong a clown and other names, and overpowers him, though getting a bullet in his arm in the process. Making all the girls board the two boats, he takes Dong, tied up on board, but then Dong's men come and having kidnapped Dolly, they free Dong from the chamber. Dong warns major Rao to come to Dongrila and rescue his daughter within the next year i.e., 12 months from that very day. He chants an eerie verse and cuts off one of Krishna Rao's legs, thus making him handicapped.\n\nKrishna Rao recruits the best Indian army officers Captain Ranvir ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), Captain Rakesh ([[Aditya Pancholi]]), Captain Javed ([[Javed Jaffrey]]), Captain Anju (Ekta Sohini) and former disgraced Major Dharam Singh ([[Dharmendra]]). Then he somehow makes Shammi Kapoor, the second senior general and Mr. Iyer, the committee chairman agree to his plan. They agree on the condition that Krishna' team's victory would be a national victory, but their defeat will be a personal issue. Then Krishna Rao's team starts their journey and they go on a perilous journey between the borders of China and India to rescue Dolly as well as dozens of school girls held in Dong's captivity and destroy Dong's kingdom of Dongrila.\n\nWhile the force five leaves, Major Kapoor is seen betraying their locations to Capt. Synthia, who works for General Dong. Allah Rakha catches Kapoor red handed and reprimands him severely. He expresses his regret that an Indian himself is selling the nation to the enemies. While Allah Rakha tries to finish Kapoor, the latter deceitfully shoots him with a pistol through his blazer pocket and kills him, thus wiping out the first crucial witness.\n\nIn their journey, they are helped by Jenny, wife of Dongrila's ex-army chief Mr D'Costa, Prince Couv and Julie. It so happens that in the big city hospital, Major Rao contracts gangrene in his left leg and needs to be operated on. But Dong's men surround the hospital and shooting begins. They even cut off the electrical supply so the team decides to obtain a generator from the base room. Rakesh says that they shall have to capture the whole area after killing all these soldiers. Just then Krishna comes there and says that they've already endangered the mission. He asks them to escape by going down a valley that Anju discovered on the other side of the hospital. Dharam Singh says that he will complete the mission here itself and asks major Rao to behave like a commander. But Major Rao chooses him as the next commander and makes him promise to lead the team for making the mission a success. All of them start climbing down the valley as Major Rao gathers all the guns and starts fighting alone. As the team reaches the foot of the valley, Dong's men blast the hospital acting by his orders and by sheer misfortune, Major Rao loses his life in fighting the Dong's Army. Another blow strikes when Julie's brother captain Jello kills the little son of Mrs. D'costa as he catches the child spying on them. It is revealed that the little boy was helping Prince Couv. It is found out that Julie is an informer of Dong's Captain Cynthia. Her identity is disclosed and she is killed by Captain Ranvir. Then, in retaliation, Dong gives execution orders for Cynthia. But, Cynthia is saved by Javed and Rakesh, who is then offered to switch sides. Then, they all attack Dong and kill him. But, lastly Brigadier Kapoor attacks the team and reveals himself as an informer of Dong. But, he is cleverly killed by Major Dharam Singh, saying the famous dialogue of the movie ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', \"If you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dharmendra]] as Major Dharam Singh\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Captain Ranvir\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as General Dong \n* [[Shammi Kapoor]] as Brigadier Kapoor\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Pallavi Joshi]] as Julie\n* [[Aditya Pancholi]] as Captain Rakesh\n* [[Ekta Sohini]] as Captain Anju Sinha\n* [[Javed Jaffrey]] as Captain Javed\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Intelligence Chief Cynthia\n* [[Dilip Dhawan]] as Captain Wilson D'Costa\n* [[Sonu Walia]] as  Jenny D' Costa  \n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Prince Kow\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Orderly Allah Rakha\n* [[Sudhir (Hindi actor)]] as Dong's Right Hand\n* [[Tom Alter]]\tas Dong's army captain\n* [[Bob Christo]] as Dong's Henchman\t\t\n* [[Dan Dhanoa]] as Jelu (Julie's Brother)\n* [[Jack Gaud]]\tas Dong's Army Capt.

This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its [[subject (grammar)|subject]] agree in ''person''. The pronouns ''I'' and ''he'' are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms ''am'' and ''is''. The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject in contrast to [[Synesis|notional agreement]], which is based on meaning.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Merriam-Webster | year = 1998 | title = Merriam-Webster's Manual For Writers And Editors | publisher = Merriam-Webster | page = [https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersm0000merr/page/376 376] | isbn = 087779622X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersm0000merr/page/376 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Cervel, Mendoza Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez | year = 2005 | title = Cognitive Linguistics: Internal Dynamics and Interdisciplinary Interaction | publisher = De Gruyter | page = 378 | isbn= 3110197715}}</ref> For instance, in American English the phrase ''the [[United Nations]]'' is treated as singular for purposes of agreement even though it is formally [[plural]].\n\n== By category ==\nAgreement generally involves matching the value of some [[grammatical category]] between different [[constituent (grammar)|constituent]]s of a sentence (or sometimes between sentences, as in some cases where a [[pronoun]] is required to agree with its [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] or [[reference|referent]]). Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below.\n\n===Person===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical person]] is found mostly between [[verb]] and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. An example from English (''I am'' vs. ''he is'') has been given in the introduction to this article.\n\nAgreement between pronoun (or corresponding [[possessive adjective]]) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person. For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase ''Mary and I'', then a first person pronoun (''we/us/our'') is required; however, most noun phrases (''the dog'', ''my cats'', ''Jack and Jill'', etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (''he/she/it/they'' etc.).\n\n===Number===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical number]] can occur between verb and subject, as in the case of grammatical person discussed above. In fact the two categories are often conflated within [[verb conjugation]] patterns: there are specific verb forms for first person singular, second person plural and so on. Some examples:\n* ''<u>I</u> really <u>am</u>'' (1st pers. singular) vs. ''<u>We</u> really <u>are</u>'' (1st pers. plural)\n* ''The boy sing<u>s</u>'' (3rd pers. singular) vs. ''The boy<u>s</u> sing'' (3rd pers. plural)\n\nAgain as with person, there is agreement in number between pronouns (or their corresponding possessives) and antecedents: \n* ''The girl did <u>her</u> job'' vs. ''The girl<u>s</u> did <u>their</u> job''\n\nAgreement also occurs between nouns and their [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s, in some situations. This is common in languages such as French and Spanish, where [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[determiners]] and [[adjective]]s (both attributive and predicative) agree in number with the nouns they qualify:\n* ''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the great man\") vs. ''<u>les</u> grand<u>s</u> homme<u>s</u>'' (\"the great men\")\n*<u>''el''</u> ''hombre alto'' (\"the tall man\") vs. ''<u>los</u> hombre<u>s</u> alto<u>s</u>'' (\"the tall men\")\n\nIn English this is not such a common feature, although there are certain determiners that occur specifically with singular or plural nouns only:\n*''<u>One</u> big car'' vs. ''<u>Two</u> big car<u>s</u>''\n*''<u>Much</u> great work'' vs. ''<u>Many</u> great work<u>s</u>''\n\n===Gender===\nIn languages in which [[grammatical gender]] plays a significant role, there is often agreement in gender between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[French grammar|French]]:\n*''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the big man\"; ''homme'' is masculine) vs. ''<u>la</u> grand<u>e</u> chaise'' (\"the big chair\"; ''chaise'' is feminine)\nSuch agreement is also found with [[predicate adjective]]s: ''l'homme est grand'' (\"the man is big\") vs. ''la chaise est grand<u>e</u>'' (\"the chair is big\"). (However, in some languages, such as [[German grammar|German]], this is not the case; only attributive modifiers show agreement.)\n\nIn the case of verbs, gender agreement is less common, although it may still occur. For example, in the French compound past tense, the past participle agrees in certain circumstances with the subject or with an object (see ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' for details). In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and most other [[Slavic languages]], the form of the past tense agrees in gender with the subject.\n\nThere is also agreement in gender between pronouns and antecedents. Examples of this can be found in English (although English pronouns principally follow natural gender rather than grammatical gender):\n*''The <u>man</u> reached <u>his</u> destination'' vs. ''The <u>ship</u> reached <u>her</u>/<u>its</u> destination''\nFor more detail see [[Gender in English]].\n\n===Case===\nIn languages that have a system of [[grammatical case|cases]], there is often agreement by case between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[German grammar|German]]:\n*''<u>der</u> gut<u>e</u> Mann'' (\"the good man\", [[nominative]] case) vs. ''<u>des</u> gut<u>en</u> Mann<u>(e)s</u>'' (\"of the good man\", [[genitive]] case)\nIn fact, the modifiers of nouns in languages such as German and [[Latin]] agree with their nouns in number, gender and case; all three categories are conflated together in paradigms of [[declension]].\n\nCase agreement is not a significant feature of English (only [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] and the pronoun [[who (pronoun)|''who'']] have any case marking). Agreement between such pronouns can sometimes be observed:\n*''<u>Who</u> came first \u2013 <u>he</u> or his brother?'' vs. ''<u>Whom</u> did you see \u2013 <u>him</u> or his brother?''\n\n=== Alliterative agreement ===\nA rare type of agreement that phonologically copies parts of the head rather than agreeing with a [[grammatical category]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staticweb.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/alexis.dimitriadis/papers/allit-glow97.pdf|title=Alliterative Concord in Phonology-Free Syntax|last=Dimitriadis|first=Alexis}}</ref> For example, in [[Banyum language|Bainouk]]:\n\n''<u>ka</u>tama-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u> / <u>ka</u>tama-<u>\u0101</u>-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u>-<u>\u0101</u>''\n\n''river-prox. this / river-pl-prox. these''\n\nIn this example, what is copied is not a prefix, but rather the initial syllable of the head \"river\".\n\n==By language==\nLanguages can have no conventional agreement whatsoever, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]]; barely any, as in [[English language|English]]; a small amount, as in spoken [[French language|French]]; a moderate amount, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]]; or a large amount, as in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\n\n===English===\nModern English does not have a particularly large amount of agreement, although it is present.\n\nApart from verbs, the main examples are the determiners \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, which become \u201cthese\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d respectively when the following noun is plural:\n: ''this woman'' \u2014 ''these women''\n: ''that dog'' \u2014 ''those dogs''\n\nAll [[English verbs|regular verbs]] (and nearly all [[English irregular verbs|irregular]] ones) in English agree in the third-person singular of the present [[indicative]] by adding a [[Affix|suffix]] of either ''-s'' or ''-es''.  The latter is generally used after stems ending in the [[sibilant]]s ''sh'', ''ch'', ''ss'' or ''zz'' (e.g. ''he rushes'', ''it lurches'', ''she amasses'', ''it buzzes''.)\n\nPresent tense of ''to love'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I love''|| ''we love''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you love''|| ''you love''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it love'''s'''''|| ''they love''\n|}\n\nThere are not many irregularities in this formation:\n* ''to have'','' to go'' and ''to do'' render ''has'', ''goes'' and ''does''.\n\nThe highly irregular verb ''to be'' is the only verb with more agreement than this in the present tense.\n\nPresent tense of ''to be'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I am''|| ''we are''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you are''|| ''you are''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it is''|| ''they are''\n|}\n\nIn English, [[defective verb]]s generally show no agreement for person or number, they include the [[modal verb]]s: ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'', ''will'', ''must'', ''should'', ''ought''.\n\nIn [[Early Modern English]] agreement existed for the second person singular of all verbs in the present tense, as well as in the past tense of some common verbs.  This was usually in the form ''-est'', but ''-st'' and ''-t'' also occurred.  Note that this does not affect the endings for other persons and numbers.\n\nExample present tense forms: ''thou wilt'', ''thou shalt'', ''thou art'', ''thou hast'', ''thou canst''.\nExample past tense forms: ''thou wouldst'', ''thou shouldst'', ''thou wast'', ''thou hadst'', ''thou couldst''\n\nNote also the agreement shown by ''to be'' even in the [[subjunctive mood]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Imperfect subjunctive of ''to be'' in Early modern English\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''(if) I were''|| ''(if) we were''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''(if) [[thou]] wert''|| ''(if) you were''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''(if) he/she/it were''|| ''(if) they were''\n|}\n\nHowever, for nearly all regular verbs, a separate ''[[thou]]'' form was no longer commonly used in the past tense.  Thus the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'' is used, e.g.'' thou didst help'', not ''*thou helpedst''.\n\n===Latin===\nCompared with English, Latin is an example of a highly [[inflected]] language. The consequences for agreement are thus:\n\nVerbs must agree in person and number, and sometimes in gender, with their subjects.  Articles and adjectives must agree in case, number and gender with the nouns they modify.\n\nSample Latin (Spanish) verb: the present indicative active of ''portare'' (''portar''), to carry:\n\n:port''o'' (port''o'') -  I carry\n\n:port''as'' (port''as'') - you [singular] carry\n\n:port''at'' (port''a'') - he carries\n\n:port''amus'' (port''amos'') - we carry\n\n:port''atis'' (port''\u00e1is'') - you [plural] carry\n\n:port''ant'', (port''an'') - they carry\n\nIn Latin, a pronoun such as \"ego\" and \"tu\" is only inserted for contrast and selection. Proper nouns and common nouns functioning as subject are nonetheless frequent. For this reason, Latin is described as a [[null-subject language]].\n\n===French===\nSpoken French always distinguishes the second person plural, and the first person plural in formal speech, from each other and from the rest of the present tense in all verbs in the first conjugation (infinitives in -er) other than ''aller''. The first person plural form and pronoun (''nous'') are now usually replaced by the pronoun ''on'' (literally: \"one\") and a third person singular verb form in Modern French. Thus, ''nous travaillons'' (formal) becomes ''on travaille''. In most verbs from the other conjugations, each person in the plural can be distinguished among themselves and from the singular forms, again, when using the traditional first person plural. The other endings that appear in written French (i.e.: all singular endings, and also the third person plural of verbs other than those with infinitives in -er) are often pronounced the same, except in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] contexts. Irregular verbs such as ''\u00eatre'', ''faire'', ''aller'', and ''avoir'' possess more distinctly pronounced agreement forms than regular verbs.\n\nAn example of this is the verb ''travailler'', which goes as follows (the single words in italic type are pronounced /t\u0281a.vaj/):\n* je ''travaille''\n* tu ''travailles''\n* il ''travaille''\n* nous travaillons, or on ''travaille''\n* vous travaillez\n* ils ''travaillent''\n\nOn the other hand, a verb like ''partir'' has (the single words in italic type are pronounced /pa\u0281/):\n* je ''pars''\n* tu ''pars''\n* il ''part''\n* nous partons, or on ''part''\n* vous partez\n* ils partent\n\nThe final S or T is silent, and the other three forms sound different from one another and from the singular forms.\n\nAdjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify in French. As with verbs, the agreements are sometimes only shown in spelling since forms that are written with different agreement suffixes are sometimes pronounced the same (e.g. ''joli'', ''jolie''); although in many cases the final consonant is pronounced in feminine forms, but silent in masculine forms (e.g. ''petit'' vs. ''petite''). Most plural forms end in ''-s'', but this consonant is only pronounced in liaison contexts, and it is determinants that help understand if the singular or plural is meant. The [[participle]]s of verbs agree in gender and number with the subject or object in some instances.\n\nArticles, possessives and other determinants also decline for number and (only in the singular) for gender, with plural determinants being the same for both genders. This normally produces three forms: one for masculine singular nouns, one for feminine singular nouns, and another for plural nouns of either gender:\n* Definite article: ''le, la, les''\n* Indefinite article: ''un, une, des''\n* Partitive article: ''du, de la, des''\n* Possessives (for the first person singular): ''mon, ma, mes''\n* Demonstratives: ''ce, cette, ces''\n\nNotice that some of the above also change (in the singular) if the following word begins with a vowel: ''le'' and ''la'' become ''l\u2032'', ''du'' and ''de la'' become ''de l\u2032'', ''ma'' becomes ''mon'' (as if the noun  were masculine) and ''ce'' becomes ''cet''.\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], verbs have [[polypersonal agreement]], which means they agree with more than one of the verb's [[verb argument|arguments]]: not only its subject but also its (accusative) object. Difference is made between the case when there is a definite object and the case when the object is indefinite or there is no object at all. (The adverbs do not affect the form of the verb.) Examples: ''Szeretek'' (I love somebody or something unspecified), ''szeretem'' (I love him, her, it, or them, specifically), ''szeretlek'' (I love you); ''szeret'' (he loves me, us, you, someone, or something unspecified), ''szereti'' (he loves her, him, it, or them specifically). Of course, nouns or pronouns may specify the exact object. In short, there is agreement between a verb and the person and number of its subject and the specificity of its object (which often refers to the person more or less exactly).\n\n:''See [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)#Definite and indefinite conjugations|Definite and indefinite conjugations]]''\n\nThe [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] agrees in number with the subject and if it is [[Copula (linguistics)|copulative]] (i.e., it consists of a noun/adjective and a linking verb), both parts agree in number with the subject. For example: ''A k\u00f6nyv'''ek''' \u00e9rdekes'''ek''' volt'''ak''''' \"The books were interesting\" (\"a\": the, \"k\u00f6nyv\": book, \"\u00e9rdekes\": interesting, \"voltak\": were): the plural is marked on the subject as well as both the adjectival and the copulative part of the predicate.\n\nWithin noun phrases, adjectives do not show agreement with the noun, though pronouns do. e.g. ''a sz\u00e9p k\u00f6nyv'''eitekkel''''' \"with your nice books\" (\"sz\u00e9p\": nice):  the suffixes of the plural, the possessive \"your\" and the case marking \"with\" are only marked on the noun.\n\n===Scandinavian languages===\n\n==== [[Adjective|Adjectives]] ====\nIn the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], adjectives (both [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] and [[Predicative adjective|predicative]]) are declined according to the [[Gender (grammar)|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[definiteness]] of the noun they modify. In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], adjectives are also declined according to [[grammatical case]], unlike the other Scandinavian languages.  \n\nIn some cases in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], adjectives and participles as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] appear to disagree with their subjects. This phenomenon is referred to as [[pancake sentence]]s. \n\n===== Examples (Norwegian) =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agreement of the adjective \u00abliten\u00bb(small) in Norwegian\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Plural\n!Definite (strong inflection)\n|-\n|Liten\n|Lita\n|Lite\n|Sm\u00e5\n|Lille\n|}\n\n* En '''liten''' gnist (a small spark)\n* Ei '''lita''' hytte (a small cabin)\n* Et '''lite''' tre (a small tree)\n*De '''sm\u00e5''' barna (the small children)\n* Flammen er '''liten''' (the fire is small)\n* Hytta er '''lita''' (the cabin is small)\n* Treet er '''lite''' (the tree is small)\n*Barna er '''sm\u00e5''' (the children are small)\n* Den '''lille''' gutten (the small boy)\n\n==== [[Participle|Participles]] ====\nIn [[Norwegian Nynorsk|Norwegian nynorsk]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the past participle must agree in gender, number and definiteness when the participle is in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] or [[Predicative adjective|predicative]] position. In Icelandic and Faroese, past participles would also have to agree in grammatical case.\n\nIn [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] it is only required to decline past participles in number and definiteness when in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] position. \n\n===Slavic languages===\n\nMost [[Slavic languages]] are highly inflected, except for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. The agreement is similar to Latin, for instance between adjectives and nouns in gender, number, case and [[animacy]] (if counted as a separate category). The following examples are from [[Serbo-Croatian]]:\n\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>malom</u> stanu'' \"I live in a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, locative)\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>maloj</u> ku\u0107i'' \"I live in a small house\" (feminine, singular, locative)\n: ''imam <u>mali</u> stan'' \"I have a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malu</u> ku\u0107u'' \"I have a small house\" (feminine, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malog</u> psa'' \"I have a small dog\" (masculine animate, singular, accusative)\n\nVerbs have 6 different forms in the present tense, for three persons in singular and plural. As in Latin, subject is frequently dropped.\n\nAnother characteristic is agreement in participles, which have different forms for different genders:\n\n: ''ja sam <u>jela</u>'' \"I was eating\" (female speaking)\n: ''ja sam <u>jeo</u>'' \"I was eating\" (male speaking)\n\n===Swahili===\n[[Swahili language|Swahili]], like all other [[Bantu languages]], has numerous [[noun class]]es. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: '''''Ki'''tabu '''ki'''moja '''ki'''tatosha'' (One book will be enough)'', '''M'''chungwa '''m'''moja '''u'''tatosha'' (One orange-tree will be enough), ''Chungwa moja '''li'''tatosha'' (One orange will be enough).\n \nThere is also agreement in number. For example: '''''Vi'''tabu '''vi'''wili '''vi'''tatosha'' (Two books will be enough), '''''Mi'''chungwa '''mi'''wili '''i'''tatosha'' (Two orange-trees will be enough), '''''Ma'''chungwa '''ma'''wili '''ya'''tatosha'' (Two oranges will be enough).\n \nClass and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, as illustrated by the examples.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attraction (grammar)]]\n*[[Case government]]\n*[[Declension]]\n*[[Inflection]]\n*[[Redundancy (linguistics)]]\n*[[Sequence of tenses]] &mdash; sometimes called '''agreement of tenses'''\n*[[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |first1=Greville G. |last1=Corbett |chapter=Agreement |editor1-last=Asher|editor1-first=R.

The pronouns ''I'' and ''he'' are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms ''am'' and ''is''.

Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below.\n\n===Person===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical person]] is found mostly between [[verb]] and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. An example from English (''I am'' vs. ''he is'') has been given in the introduction to this article.\n\nAgreement between pronoun (or corresponding [[possessive adjective]]) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person. For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase ''Mary and I'', then a first person pronoun (''we/us/our'') is required; however, most noun phrases (''the dog'', ''my cats'', ''Jack and Jill'', etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (''he/she/it/they'' etc.).\n\n===Number===\nAgreement based on [[grammatical number]] can occur between verb and subject, as in the case of grammatical person discussed above. In fact the two categories are often conflated within [[verb conjugation]] patterns: there are specific verb forms for first person singular, second person plural and so on. Some examples:\n* ''<u>I</u> really <u>am</u>'' (1st pers. singular) vs. ''<u>We</u> really <u>are</u>'' (1st pers. plural)\n* ''The boy sing<u>s</u>'' (3rd pers. singular) vs. ''The boy<u>s</u> sing'' (3rd pers. plural)\n\nAgain as with person, there is agreement in number between pronouns (or their corresponding possessives) and antecedents: \n* ''The girl did <u>her</u> job'' vs. ''The girl<u>s</u> did <u>their</u> job''\n\nAgreement also occurs between nouns and their [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s, in some situations. This is common in languages such as French and Spanish, where [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[determiners]] and [[adjective]]s (both attributive and predicative) agree in number with the nouns they qualify:\n* ''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the great man\") vs. ''<u>les</u> grand<u>s</u> homme<u>s</u>'' (\"the great men\")\n*<u>''el''</u> ''hombre alto'' (\"the tall man\") vs. ''<u>los</u> hombre<u>s</u> alto<u>s</u>'' (\"the tall men\")\n\nIn English this is not such a common feature, although there are certain determiners that occur specifically with singular or plural nouns only:\n*''<u>One</u> big car'' vs. ''<u>Two</u> big car<u>s</u>''\n*''<u>Much</u> great work'' vs. ''<u>Many</u> great work<u>s</u>''\n\n===Gender===\nIn languages in which [[grammatical gender]] plays a significant role, there is often agreement in gender between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[French grammar|French]]:\n*''<u>le</u> grand homme'' (\"the big man\"; ''homme'' is masculine) vs. ''<u>la</u> grand<u>e</u> chaise'' (\"the big chair\"; ''chaise'' is feminine)\nSuch agreement is also found with [[predicate adjective]]s: ''l'homme est grand'' (\"the man is big\") vs. ''la chaise est grand<u>e</u>'' (\"the chair is big\"). (However, in some languages, such as [[German grammar|German]], this is not the case; only attributive modifiers show agreement.)\n\nIn the case of verbs, gender agreement is less common, although it may still occur. For example, in the French compound past tense, the past participle agrees in certain circumstances with the subject or with an object (see ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' for details). In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and most other [[Slavic languages]], the form of the past tense agrees in gender with the subject.\n\nThere is also agreement in gender between pronouns and antecedents. Examples of this can be found in English (although English pronouns principally follow natural gender rather than grammatical gender):\n*''The <u>man</u> reached <u>his</u> destination'' vs. ''The <u>ship</u> reached <u>her</u>/<u>its</u> destination''\nFor more detail see [[Gender in English]].\n\n===Case===\nIn languages that have a system of [[grammatical case|cases]], there is often agreement by case between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in [[German grammar|German]]:\n*''<u>der</u> gut<u>e</u> Mann'' (\"the good man\", [[nominative]] case) vs. ''<u>des</u> gut<u>en</u> Mann<u>(e)s</u>'' (\"of the good man\", [[genitive]] case)\nIn fact, the modifiers of nouns in languages such as German and [[Latin]] agree with their nouns in number, gender and case; all three categories are conflated together in paradigms of [[declension]].\n\nCase agreement is not a significant feature of English (only [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] and the pronoun [[who (pronoun)|''who'']] have any case marking). Agreement between such pronouns can sometimes be observed:\n*''<u>Who</u> came first \u2013 <u>he</u> or his brother?'' vs. ''<u>Whom</u> did you see \u2013 <u>him</u> or his brother?''\n\n=== Alliterative agreement ===\nA rare type of agreement that phonologically copies parts of the head rather than agreeing with a [[grammatical category]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staticweb.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/alexis.dimitriadis/papers/allit-glow97.pdf|title=Alliterative Concord in Phonology-Free Syntax|last=Dimitriadis|first=Alexis}}</ref> For example, in [[Banyum language|Bainouk]]:\n\n''<u>ka</u>tama-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u> / <u>ka</u>tama-<u>\u0101</u>-\u014b\u0254 in-<u>ka</u>-<u>\u0101</u>''\n\n''river-prox. this / river-pl-prox. these''\n\nIn this example, what is copied is not a prefix, but rather the initial syllable of the head \"river\".\n\n==By language==\nLanguages can have no conventional agreement whatsoever, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]]; barely any, as in [[English language|English]]; a small amount, as in spoken [[French language|French]]; a moderate amount, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]]; or a large amount, as in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\n\n===English===\nModern English does not have a particularly large amount of agreement, although it is present.\n\nApart from verbs, the main examples are the determiners \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, which become \u201cthese\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d respectively when the following noun is plural:\n: ''this woman'' \u2014 ''these women''\n: ''that dog'' \u2014 ''those dogs''\n\nAll [[English verbs|regular verbs]] (and nearly all [[English irregular verbs|irregular]] ones) in English agree in the third-person singular of the present [[indicative]] by adding a [[Affix|suffix]] of either ''-s'' or ''-es''.  The latter is generally used after stems ending in the [[sibilant]]s ''sh'', ''ch'', ''ss'' or ''zz'' (e.g. ''he rushes'', ''it lurches'', ''she amasses'', ''it buzzes''.)\n\nPresent tense of ''to love'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I love''|| ''we love''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you love''|| ''you love''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it love'''s'''''|| ''they love''\n|}\n\nThere are not many irregularities in this formation:\n* ''to have'','' to go'' and ''to do'' render ''has'', ''goes'' and ''does''.\n\nThe highly irregular verb ''to be'' is the only verb with more agreement than this in the present tense.\n\nPresent tense of ''to be'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''I am''|| ''we are''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''you are''|| ''you are''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''he/she/it is''|| ''they are''\n|}\n\nIn English, [[defective verb]]s generally show no agreement for person or number, they include the [[modal verb]]s: ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'', ''will'', ''must'', ''should'', ''ought''.\n\nIn [[Early Modern English]] agreement existed for the second person singular of all verbs in the present tense, as well as in the past tense of some common verbs.  This was usually in the form ''-est'', but ''-st'' and ''-t'' also occurred.  Note that this does not affect the endings for other persons and numbers.\n\nExample present tense forms: ''thou wilt'', ''thou shalt'', ''thou art'', ''thou hast'', ''thou canst''.\nExample past tense forms: ''thou wouldst'', ''thou shouldst'', ''thou wast'', ''thou hadst'', ''thou couldst''\n\nNote also the agreement shown by ''to be'' even in the [[subjunctive mood]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Imperfect subjunctive of ''to be'' in Early modern English\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Person\n! colspan=\"2\"| Number\n|-\n! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n! First\n| ''(if) I were''|| ''(if) we were''\n|-\n! Second\n| ''(if) [[thou]] wert''|| ''(if) you were''\n|-\n! Third\n| ''(if) he/she/it were''|| ''(if) they were''\n|}\n\nHowever, for nearly all regular verbs, a separate ''[[thou]]'' form was no longer commonly used in the past tense.  Thus the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'' is used, e.g.'' thou didst help'', not ''*thou helpedst''.\n\n===Latin===\nCompared with English, Latin is an example of a highly [[inflected]] language. The consequences for agreement are thus:\n\nVerbs must agree in person and number, and sometimes in gender, with their subjects.  Articles and adjectives must agree in case, number and gender with the nouns they modify.\n\nSample Latin (Spanish) verb: the present indicative active of ''portare'' (''portar''), to carry:\n\n:port''o'' (port''o'') -  I carry\n\n:port''as'' (port''as'') - you [singular] carry\n\n:port''at'' (port''a'') - he carries\n\n:port''amus'' (port''amos'') - we carry\n\n:port''atis'' (port''\u00e1is'') - you [plural] carry\n\n:port''ant'', (port''an'') - they carry\n\nIn Latin, a pronoun such as \"ego\" and \"tu\" is only inserted for contrast and selection. Proper nouns and common nouns functioning as subject are nonetheless frequent. For this reason, Latin is described as a [[null-subject language]].\n\n===French===\nSpoken French always distinguishes the second person plural, and the first person plural in formal speech, from each other and from the rest of the present tense in all verbs in the first conjugation (infinitives in -er) other than ''aller''. The first person plural form and pronoun (''nous'') are now usually replaced by the pronoun ''on'' (literally: \"one\") and a third person singular verb form in Modern French. Thus, ''nous travaillons'' (formal) becomes ''on travaille''. In most verbs from the other conjugations, each person in the plural can be distinguished among themselves and from the singular forms, again, when using the traditional first person plural. The other endings that appear in written French (i.e.: all singular endings, and also the third person plural of verbs other than those with infinitives in -er) are often pronounced the same, except in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] contexts. Irregular verbs such as ''\u00eatre'', ''faire'', ''aller'', and ''avoir'' possess more distinctly pronounced agreement forms than regular verbs.\n\nAn example of this is the verb ''travailler'', which goes as follows (the single words in italic type are pronounced /t\u0281a.vaj/):\n* je ''travaille''\n* tu ''travailles''\n* il ''travaille''\n* nous travaillons, or on ''travaille''\n* vous travaillez\n* ils ''travaillent''\n\nOn the other hand, a verb like ''partir'' has (the single words in italic type are pronounced /pa\u0281/):\n* je ''pars''\n* tu ''pars''\n* il ''part''\n* nous partons, or on ''part''\n* vous partez\n* ils partent\n\nThe final S or T is silent, and the other three forms sound different from one another and from the singular forms.\n\nAdjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify in French. As with verbs, the agreements are sometimes only shown in spelling since forms that are written with different agreement suffixes are sometimes pronounced the same (e.g. ''joli'', ''jolie''); although in many cases the final consonant is pronounced in feminine forms, but silent in masculine forms (e.g. ''petit'' vs. ''petite''). Most plural forms end in ''-s'', but this consonant is only pronounced in liaison contexts, and it is determinants that help understand if the singular or plural is meant. The [[participle]]s of verbs agree in gender and number with the subject or object in some instances.\n\nArticles, possessives and other determinants also decline for number and (only in the singular) for gender, with plural determinants being the same for both genders. This normally produces three forms: one for masculine singular nouns, one for feminine singular nouns, and another for plural nouns of either gender:\n* Definite article: ''le, la, les''\n* Indefinite article: ''un, une, des''\n* Partitive article: ''du, de la, des''\n* Possessives (for the first person singular): ''mon, ma, mes''\n* Demonstratives: ''ce, cette, ces''\n\nNotice that some of the above also change (in the singular) if the following word begins with a vowel: ''le'' and ''la'' become ''l\u2032'', ''du'' and ''de la'' become ''de l\u2032'', ''ma'' becomes ''mon'' (as if the noun  were masculine) and ''ce'' becomes ''cet''.\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], verbs have [[polypersonal agreement]], which means they agree with more than one of the verb's [[verb argument|arguments]]: not only its subject but also its (accusative) object. Difference is made between the case when there is a definite object and the case when the object is indefinite or there is no object at all. (The adverbs do not affect the form of the verb.) Examples: ''Szeretek'' (I love somebody or something unspecified), ''szeretem'' (I love him, her, it, or them, specifically), ''szeretlek'' (I love you); ''szeret'' (he loves me, us, you, someone, or something unspecified), ''szereti'' (he loves her, him, it, or them specifically). Of course, nouns or pronouns may specify the exact object. In short, there is agreement between a verb and the person and number of its subject and the specificity of its object (which often refers to the person more or less exactly).\n\n:''See [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)#Definite and indefinite conjugations|Definite and indefinite conjugations]]''\n\nThe [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] agrees in number with the subject and if it is [[Copula (linguistics)|copulative]] (i.e., it consists of a noun/adjective and a linking verb), both parts agree in number with the subject. For example: ''A k\u00f6nyv'''ek''' \u00e9rdekes'''ek''' volt'''ak''''' \"The books were interesting\" (\"a\": the, \"k\u00f6nyv\": book, \"\u00e9rdekes\": interesting, \"voltak\": were): the plural is marked on the subject as well as both the adjectival and the copulative part of the predicate.\n\nWithin noun phrases, adjectives do not show agreement with the noun, though pronouns do. e.g. ''a sz\u00e9p k\u00f6nyv'''eitekkel''''' \"with your nice books\" (\"sz\u00e9p\": nice):  the suffixes of the plural, the possessive \"your\" and the case marking \"with\" are only marked on the noun.\n\n===Scandinavian languages===\n\n==== [[Adjective|Adjectives]] ====\nIn the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], adjectives (both [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] and [[Predicative adjective|predicative]]) are declined according to the [[Gender (grammar)|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[definiteness]] of the noun they modify. In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], adjectives are also declined according to [[grammatical case]], unlike the other Scandinavian languages.  \n\nIn some cases in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], adjectives and participles as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] appear to disagree with their subjects. This phenomenon is referred to as [[pancake sentence]]s. \n\n===== Examples (Norwegian) =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agreement of the adjective \u00abliten\u00bb(small) in Norwegian\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Plural\n!Definite (strong inflection)\n|-\n|Liten\n|Lita\n|Lite\n|Sm\u00e5\n|Lille\n|}\n\n* En '''liten''' gnist (a small spark)\n* Ei '''lita''' hytte (a small cabin)\n* Et '''lite''' tre (a small tree)\n*De '''sm\u00e5''' barna (the small children)\n* Flammen er '''liten''' (the fire is small)\n* Hytta er '''lita''' (the cabin is small)\n* Treet er '''lite''' (the tree is small)\n*Barna er '''sm\u00e5''' (the children are small)\n* Den '''lille''' gutten (the small boy)\n\n==== [[Participle|Participles]] ====\nIn [[Norwegian Nynorsk|Norwegian nynorsk]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the past participle must agree in gender, number and definiteness when the participle is in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] or [[Predicative adjective|predicative]] position. In Icelandic and Faroese, past participles would also have to agree in grammatical case.\n\nIn [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] it is only required to decline past participles in number and definiteness when in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] position. \n\n===Slavic languages===\n\nMost [[Slavic languages]] are highly inflected, except for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. The agreement is similar to Latin, for instance between adjectives and nouns in gender, number, case and [[animacy]] (if counted as a separate category). The following examples are from [[Serbo-Croatian]]:\n\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>malom</u> stanu'' \"I live in a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, locative)\n: ''\u017eivim u <u>maloj</u> ku\u0107i'' \"I live in a small house\" (feminine, singular, locative)\n: ''imam <u>mali</u> stan'' \"I have a small apartment\" (masculine inanimate, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malu</u> ku\u0107u'' \"I have a small house\" (feminine, singular, accusative)\n: ''imam <u>malog</u> psa'' \"I have a small dog\" (masculine animate, singular, accusative)\n\nVerbs have 6 different forms in the present tense, for three persons in singular and plural. As in Latin, subject is frequently dropped.\n\nAnother characteristic is agreement in participles, which have different forms for different genders:\n\n: ''ja sam <u>jela</u>'' \"I was eating\" (female speaking)\n: ''ja sam <u>jeo</u>'' \"I was eating\" (male speaking)\n\n===Swahili===\n[[Swahili language|Swahili]], like all other [[Bantu languages]], has numerous [[noun class]]es. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: '''''Ki'''tabu '''ki'''moja '''ki'''tatosha'' (One book will be enough)'', '''M'''chungwa '''m'''moja '''u'''tatosha'' (One orange-tree will be enough), ''Chungwa moja '''li'''tatosha'' (One orange will be enough).\n \nThere is also agreement in number. For example: '''''Vi'''tabu '''vi'''wili '''vi'''tatosha'' (Two books will be enough), '''''Mi'''chungwa '''mi'''wili '''i'''tatosha'' (Two orange-trees will be enough), '''''Ma'''chungwa '''ma'''wili '''ya'''tatosha'' (Two oranges will be enough).\n \nClass and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, as illustrated by the examples.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attraction (grammar)]]\n*[[Case government]]\n*[[Declension]]\n*[[Inflection]]\n*[[Redundancy (linguistics)]]\n*[[Sequence of tenses]] &mdash; sometimes called '''agreement of tenses'''\n*[[Synthetic language]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |first1=Greville G. |last1=Corbett |chapter=Agreement |editor1-last=Asher|editor1-first=R.

Photo-voltaic cells use [[sunlight]] as a source of energy and generate direct current [[electricity]]. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a [[photovoltaic system]] supply [[solar electricity]] to electrical equipment.\n\nThe most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160\u201370 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}</ref>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\".

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output).

New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels.

However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel.

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced.

This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels lost a little less than 0.05% of their overall efficiency per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/cleaning_solar_panels_often_not_worth_the_cost_engineers_at_uc_san_diego_fi |title=Cleaning Solar Panels Often Not Worth the Cost, Engineers at UC San Diego Find |date=August 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |website=UC San Diego News Center |publisher=UC San Diego News Center |last=Patringenaru |first=Ioana}}</ref> There may also be [[occupational hazards of solar panel installation]] and maintenance.\n\n== Recycling ==\nMost parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.<ref>Lisa Krueger {{cite web |title=Overview of First Solar's Module Collection and Recycling Program |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 23 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/2_Krueger_IEEE-Presentation-Final.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref> Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.<ref name= \"Wambach\"> {{cite web|title=A Voluntary Take Back Scheme and Industrial Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules |last = Wambach |first = K |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 37 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/3_4_PV-Module-RecyclingWambach.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nRecycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:\n* Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure.

However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities.

The cannons were to be fired over the tops of the fort's walls. In May, [[George Washington]] described it as \"small but exceedingly strong\". On July 5, General [[Nathanael Greene]] called it \"a post of vast importance\" and, three days later, [[James Mitchell Varnum|Col.

On July 12, the British frigates [[HMS Rose (1757)|''Rose'']] and [[HMS Phoenix|''Phoenix'']] and the schooner ''Tyrol'' ran the gauntlet past Defiance and the stronger Governor's Island works without firing a shot, and got all the way to [[Tappan Zee]], the widest part of the Hudson River.

This name is derived from the original [[City of Brooklyn]] which ended at Atlantic Street, now Atlantic Avenue. By the 1950s, anything south of Atlantic Avenue was considered South Brooklyn; thus, the names \"Red Hook\" and \"South Brooklyn\" were applied also to today's [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]], [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]], [[Columbia Street Waterfront District|Columbia Heights]], and [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]] neighborhoods.

Maryhill is a former [[burgh]]. Maryhill stretches over {{convert|7|mi|km}} along Maryhill Road. The Maryhill district has several sub-districts, such as Acre, [[Botany]], [[Dawsholm Park]], [[Firhill]], Gairbraid, [[Gilshochill]], [[Maryhill Park]], [[North Kelvinside]], [[Queen's Cross (Glasgow)|Queens Cross]], St George's Cross, [[Cadder (Glasgow)|Cadder]], [[Summerston]], [[Woodside, Glasgow|Woodside]] and [[Wyndford]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe far north west of the area is served by [[Maryhill railway station]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:MaryhillMap1923.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Map of the Maryhill area, circa 1923.]]\nHew Hill, the [[Laird]], or Lord, of Gairbraid, had no male heir and so he left his estate to his daughter, [[Mary Hill of Gairbraid|Mary Hill]] (1730-1809). She married Robert Graham of Dawsholm in 1763, but they had no income from trade or commerce and had to make what they could from the estate. They founded coalmines on the estate but they proved to be wet and unprofitable, and their property ventures are best known for an acre of ground they did not sell. It is still known as Acre today.\n\nNo doubt they would have continued with the struggle, but on 8 March 1768 Parliament approved the cutting of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] through their estate, which provided some much-needed money. The canal reached the estate in 1775, but the canal company had run out of money and work stopped for eight years. The Government granted funds from forfeited [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] estates to start it again and the crossing of the [[River Kelvin]] became the focus for massive construction activity. Five locks, the great [[Kelvin Aqueduct]] and, between two of the locks, a [[dry dock]] boatyard were built. A village too began to grow up and the Grahams fed more land for its development; Robert Graham attached one condition that was to immortalise the heiress of Gairbraid, his beloved wife and the last in line of centuries of Hills of Gairbraid after the death of her father Hew Hill. The then village was to be ''\"in all times called the town of MaryHill\"''.\n\nThe new canal waterway attracted industries including; boat-building, saw-milling and ironfounding to its banks within Mary's estate. By 1830 the scattered houses had grown to form a large village with a population of 3000 people. The building of the [[Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway]] passing through Maryhill in the 1850s, and the proximity of the [[Loch Katrine]] pipeline, led to further growth and in 1856 Maryhill became a burgh in its own right. It was later absorbed into the boundaries of the city of Glasgow in 1891.\n\nA part of the [[Antonine Wall]] runs through Maryhill, in the Maryhill Park area, where there is the site of a [[Roman fort]] adjoining the wall in nearby [[Bearsden]]. A Roman bath-house may still be seen there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/bearsden/romanbaths/|title=Bearsden Roman Baths Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|first=Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nMaryhill had the first [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]] in the United Kingdom after lawlessness filled the streets in the Victorian era.\n\nMaryhill also boasts one of Glasgow's original [[Carnegie libraries]], designed by the Inverness architect [[James Robert Rhind]].\n\nMaryhill Barracks was opened in 1872 and once dominated the area that is now the [[Wyndford]] housing estate. It was home to the [[Scots Greys]] and the [[Highland Light Infantry]], and held Adolf Hitler's second-in-command [[Rudolf Hess]] during World War II after his supposed \"peace\" flight to the UK. \nThe barracks were decommissioned in the early 1960s.

However, not all areas of North Glasgow are in poor condition. Maryhill is in the north west of the city, and consists of well maintained traditionally \"Glaswegian\" sandstone tenements with the traditional high ceilings as well as many large Victorian town houses. There are also large housing association-run [[housing estates]].\n\nThe district contains the [[Wyndford]] and Gairbraid estate, a housing estate with a population of almost 5,000, containing a number of high-rise housing blocks, the highest four reaching heights of 26 storeys. These are intermixed with lower residences to create an estate of significant housing contrast and variety.\n\n== Sport ==\nMaryhill is the home of [[Firhill Stadium]], which has been the home ground of [[Scottish Professional Football League]] club [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] since 1909.

However, a more prosaic explanation is that there was a school in the area known as the Botany School, now long closed, but the name survived.<ref name=Patrick>[[James Patrick (sociologist)|James Patrick]] ''A Glasgow Gang Observed''</ref>\n\nThis reputation for being a rough area did not lessen over the years, with Botany (commonly referred to as 'The Butney' by local people) having many social problems of deprivation, unemployment and drug abuse.

Both stations were closed as part of the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s, and when the former Maryhill Park station was reopened in the 1990s the \"''Park''\" part of the title was dropped as the other station was not reopened.

She married Robert Graham of Dawsholm in 1763, but they had no income from trade or commerce and had to make what they could from the estate. They founded coalmines on the estate but they proved to be wet and unprofitable, and their property ventures are best known for an acre of ground they did not sell. It is still known as Acre today.\n\nNo doubt they would have continued with the struggle, but on 8 March 1768 Parliament approved the cutting of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] through their estate, which provided some much-needed money. The canal reached the estate in 1775, but the canal company had run out of money and work stopped for eight years. The Government granted funds from forfeited [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] estates to start it again and the crossing of the [[River Kelvin]] became the focus for massive construction activity. Five locks, the great [[Kelvin Aqueduct]] and, between two of the locks, a [[dry dock]] boatyard were built. A village too began to grow up and the Grahams fed more land for its development; Robert Graham attached one condition that was to immortalise the heiress of Gairbraid, his beloved wife and the last in line of centuries of Hills of Gairbraid after the death of her father Hew Hill. The then village was to be ''\"in all times called the town of MaryHill\"''.\n\nThe new canal waterway attracted industries including; boat-building, saw-milling and ironfounding to its banks within Mary's estate. By 1830 the scattered houses had grown to form a large village with a population of 3000 people. The building of the [[Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway]] passing through Maryhill in the 1850s, and the proximity of the [[Loch Katrine]] pipeline, led to further growth and in 1856 Maryhill became a burgh in its own right. It was later absorbed into the boundaries of the city of Glasgow in 1891.\n\nA part of the [[Antonine Wall]] runs through Maryhill, in the Maryhill Park area, where there is the site of a [[Roman fort]] adjoining the wall in nearby [[Bearsden]]. A Roman bath-house may still be seen there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/bearsden/romanbaths/|title=Bearsden Roman Baths Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|first=Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nMaryhill had the first [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]] in the United Kingdom after lawlessness filled the streets in the Victorian era.\n\nMaryhill also boasts one of Glasgow's original [[Carnegie libraries]], designed by the Inverness architect [[James Robert Rhind]].\n\nMaryhill Barracks was opened in 1872 and once dominated the area that is now the [[Wyndford]] housing estate. It was home to the [[Scots Greys]] and the [[Highland Light Infantry]], and held Adolf Hitler's second-in-command [[Rudolf Hess]] during World War II after his supposed \"peace\" flight to the UK. \nThe barracks were decommissioned in the early 1960s. However the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, the [[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion, the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] continues to be based at the adjacent [[Walcheren Barracks]].
