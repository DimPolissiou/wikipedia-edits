Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ. Kashgar's annual growth rate was 17.4 percent in 2009, and Kashgar's designation has since increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Real estate in China|real estate prices]] in the city. Kashgar is close to China's border with the independent states of former [[Soviet Central Asia]] and the SEZ seeks to capitalize on international trade links between China and those states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/25/china-s-hottest-cities-and-kashgar.html|title=A New Shenzhen|author=Fish, Isaac Stone|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-29|magazine=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>\n\n== List of SEZs ==\nAs part of its economic reforms and policy of opening to the world, between 1980 and 1984 China established [[special economic zone]]s (SEZs) in [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Zhuhai]] in [[Guangdong]] Province and [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian]] Province and designated the entire island province of [[Hainan]] a special economic zone.\n\nIn 1984, China opened 14 other coastal cities to overseas investment (listed north to south): [[Dalian]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Yantai]], [[Qingdao]], [[Lianyungang]], [[Nantong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhanjiang]], and [[Beihai]].\n\nThen, beginning in 1985, the central government expanded the coastal area by establishing the following open economic zones (listed north to south): the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Hebei|Hebei Province]] (which surrounds [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]; see [[Jingjinji]]), the [[Shandong Peninsula]], [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Xiamen]]-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in southern [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], the [[Pearl River Delta]], and [[Guangxi|Guangxi Autonomous Region]].\n\nIn 1990, the Chinese government decided to open the [[Pudong|Pudong New Area]] in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, as well as more cities in the Yang Zi River Valley.\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of border cities and all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn addition, 15 free-trade zones, 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and high-tech industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As a result, a multilevel diversified pattern of opening and integrating coastal areas with river, border, and inland areas has been formed in China.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

The policy change to a more liberalized economy is identified using SEZ variables as instrumental variables. The results indicate that export and [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] growth have positive and [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] effects on economic growth in these countries. The presence of SEZs increases regional growth but increasing the number of SEZs has negligible effect on growth. The key to faster economic growth appears to be a greater pace of liberalization.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Metropolitan regions of China]]\n*[[Economy of China]]\n*[[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]]\n*[[New areas]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Chee Kian Leong, 2007, A Tale of Two Countries: Openness and Growth in China and India [http://www.degit.ifw-kiel.de/papers/degit_12/C012_042.pdf], Dynamics, Economic Growth, and International Trade (DEGIT) Conference Paper.\n* Chee Kian Leong, (forthcoming), Special economic zones and growth in China and India: an empirical investigation,[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10368-012-0223-6] International Economics and Economic Policy.\n\n== External links ==\n*Chung-Tong Wu.

First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ.

In an attempt to make arbitration a preferred mode of settlement of commercial disputes and making India a hub of international commercial arbitration, the President of India on 23 October 2015 promulgated an Ordinance (Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015) amending the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The amended law makes a clear distinction between an international commercial arbitration and domestic arbitration with regard to the definition of 'Court'. In so far as domestic arbitration is concerned, the definition of \"Court\" is the same as was in the 1996 Act, however, for the purpose of international commercial arbitration, 'Court' has been defined to mean only High Court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, in an international commercial arbitration, as per the new law, district court will have no jurisdiction and the parties can expect speedier and efficacious determination of any issue directly by the High court which is better equipped in terms of handling commercial disputes.\n:Through the amendment, a proviso to '''Section 2(2)''' has been added which envisages that subject to the agreement to the contrary, Section 9 (interim measures), Section 27(taking of evidence), and Section 37(1)(a), 37(3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitration, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India, meaning thereby that the new law has tried to strike a kind of balance between the situations created by the judgments of Bhatia International and Balco v. Kaiser. Now Section 2(2) envisages that Part-I shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India and that provisions of Sections 9, 27, 37(1) (a) and 37 (3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitration even if the seat of arbitration is outside India unless parties to the arbitration agreement have agreed to the contrary.\n:'''Section 8''', which deals with 'Reference of parties to the dispute to arbitration', was amended. In Section 8, which mandates any judicial authority to refer the parties to arbitration in respect of an action brought before it, which is subject matter of arbitration agreement . The sub-section(1) has been amended envisaging that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any court, the judicial authority shall refer the parties to the arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. A provision has also been made enabling the party, who applies for reference of the matter to arbitration, to apply to the Court for a direction of production of the arbitration agreement or certified copy thereof in the event the parties applying for reference of the disputes to arbitration is not in the possession of the arbitration agreement and the opposite party has the same.\n:Lastly '''Section 9''', dealing with 'Interim Measures' was also amended. The amended section envisages that if the Court passes an interim measure of protection under the section before commencement of arbitral proceedings, then the arbitral proceedings shall have to commence within a period of 90 days from the date of such order or within such time as the Court may determine. Also, that the Court shall not entertain any application under section 9 unless it finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy under Section 17 efficacious.\n.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Indian legislations}}\n\n[[Category:1996 in India]]\n[[Category:1996 in law]]\n[[Category:Indian legislation]]\n[[Category:Arbitration law]]\n\n\n{{India-law-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{moresources|date=October 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{use Indian English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox legislation\n| imagesize = 100\n| enacted_by = [[Parliament of India]]\n| date_enacted = 1996\n| status = amended\n}}\nThe 'Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996' is an Act that regulates domestic [[arbitration]] in [[India]].<ref name=A>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/448666/Arbitration+Dispute+Resolution/Highlights+Of+Amendment+To+The+Arbitration+And+Conciliation+Act+1996+Via+Arbitration+Ordinance+2015|title=India: Highlights Of Amendment To The Arbitration And Conciliation Act 1996 Via Arbitration Ordinance 2015|publisher=Mondaq|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>  It was amended in 2015 and further ammendment passed in Lok Sabha on 1 August 2019.<ref name=A />\n\nThe Government of India decided to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by introducing the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Parliament.
