However, Chinese firms that are developing and investing in Cambodia, also tend to have extractive tendencies which exploits the country's natural resources. [[Illegal logging]] and shady deals involving members of Cambodia's government and Chinese firms are on a steady rise. Mining projects and government land concessions to foreign and local firms, are increasing the number of people being displaced from their land.

The South Hill bore a small [[Neolithic]] settlement; was abandoned during the [[Bronze Age]]; and was resettled in the 7th century BC. Subsequently, the town was captured by the [[Bottiaea]]ns, a Thracian tribe ejected from Macedon by [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]].\n\nFollowing the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] defeat at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] (480 BC) and with [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] having been escorted to the [[Hellespont]] by his general [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus]], the Persian army spent the winter of the same year in [[Thessaly]] and [[Achaemenid Macedonia|Macedonia]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} The Persian authority in the Balkans must have significantly decreased at the time, which encouraged the inhabitants of the [[Pallene (Chalcidice)|Pallene peninsula]] to break away.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} Suspecting that a revolt against the Great King was meditated, in order to control the situation, Artabazus captured Olynthus, which was thought to be disloyal, and killed its inhabitants.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} The town had priorly been given to Kritovoulos from [[Toroni]] and to a fresh population consisting of Greeks from the neighboring region of Chalcidice, who had been exiled by the Macedonians ([[Herodotus|Herod.]] viii. 127). Though Herodotus reports that Artabazus slaughtered them, Boetiaeans continued to live in the area.\n\nOlynthus became a Greek polis, but it remained insignificant (in the quota-lists of the [[Delian League]] it appears as paying on the average 2 talents, as compared with 6 to 15 paid by [[Nea Skioni|Scione]], 6 to 15 by [[Mende (Greece)|Mende]], 6 to 12 by [[Toroni]], and 3 to 6 by [[Ormylia|Sermylia]] from 454 to 432).\n\nIn 432 King [[Perdiccas II of Macedon]] encouraged several nearby coastal towns to disband and remove their population to Olynthus, preparatory to a revolt to be led by Potidaea against Athens ([[Thucydides|Thuc.]] 1.58). This [[synoecism]] (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2) was effected, though against Perdiccas's wishes the contributing cities were preserved.  This increase in population led to the settlement of the North Hill, which was developed on a [[Hippodamus of Miletus|Hippodamian grid plan]].  In 423 Olynthus became the head of a formal [[Chalkidian League]], occasioned by the synoecism or by the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] and fear of Athenian attack.  During the Peloponnesian war it formed a base for [[Brasidas]] in his expedition of 424 and refuge for the citizens of [[Mende (Chalcidice)|Mende]] and [[Potidaea|Poteidaea]] that had rebelled against the Athenians ([[Thucydides|Thu.]] ii, 70).\n\nAfter the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] the development of the league was rapid and ended consisting of 32 cities. About 393 we find it concluding an important treaty with [[Amyntas III of Macedon]] (the father of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]), and by 382 it had absorbed most of the Greek cities west of the Strymon, and had even got possession of [[Pella]], the chief city in [[Macedon]]. (Xenophon, Hell. V. 2, 12).\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tetradrachm from Olynthus.jpg|thumb|300px|Tetradrachm from Olynthus.

After three years of indecisive warfare Olynthus consented to dissolve the confederacy (379).  It is clear, however, that the dissolution was little more than formal, as the Chalcidians (\"\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03b4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u00f2 \u0398\u03c1\u1fb4\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2\") appear, only a year or two later, among the members of the Athenian naval confederacy of 378\u2013377.  Twenty years later, in the reign of Philip, the power of Olynthus is asserted by [[Demosthenes]] to have been much greater than before the Spartan expedition.  The town itself at this period is spoken of as a city of the first rank (\u03c0\u00f3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bcu\u03c1\u1f30\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), and the league included thirty-two cities.\n\nWhen the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Athens and its allies (357), Olynthus was at first in alliance with Philip. Subsequently, in alarm at the growth of his power, it concluded an alliance with Athens. Olynthus made three embassies to Athens, the occasions of Demosthenes's three [[Olynthiacs|Olynthiac Orations]].  On the third, the Athenians sent soldiers from among its citizens.  After Philip had deprived Olynthus of the rest of the League, by force and by the treachery of sympathetic factions, he besieged Olynthus in 348.  The siege was short; he bought Olynthus's two principal citizens, Euthycrates and Lasthenes,<ref>http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0003:chapter=2:sect=3:subsection=4</ref> who betrayed the city to him. He then looted and razed the city and sold its population&mdash;including the Athenian garrison&mdash;into slavery. According to the latest researches only a small area of the North Hill was ever re-occupied, up to 318, before [[Cassander]] forced the population to move in his new city of [[Cassandreia]].\n\nThough the city was extinguished, through subsequent centuries there would be men scattered through the Hellenistic world who were called Olynthians.\n\n==Topography and archaeology==\n[[Image:Ancient Olynthos Chalkidiki - Greece - 043.jpg|thumb|left|Floor mosaic depicting [[Bellerophon]] scene in a house of ancient city of Olynthos.]]\n\nThe city of Olynthus lies in the hill named ''Megale Toumba'' near the village of Myriophyto. The probable site of Olynthus was identified as early as 1902. Between 1914 and 1916 plans were made for an excavation by the [[British School at Athens]], but these fell through.\n\nThe ancient city extends over two hills that detach from a small [[coulee]] and possess an area ca. 1500 m long and 400 m in width. Excavations began in 1928. Prof. [[David Moore Robinson]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]], under the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]], conducted four seasons of work: in 1928, 1931, 1934, and 1939.

Along the south avenue shops and small houses were found while the administrative part was located in the north part of the hill, where the [[agora]] and a [[deanery]] were found.\n\n[[File:Ancient Olynthos Chalkidiki - Greece - 006.jpg|thumb|180px|Tombstone in Olynthus]]\n\nThe [[classical antiquity|classical]] city was established on the much larger north hill and to its eastern slope. The excavations, which cover only 1/10 of the city's total area, have revealed a [[Hippodamian]] [[grid plan]]. Two large avenues were discovered, with an amplitude of 7 meters, along with vertical and horizontal streets that divided the urban area into [[city block]]s. Each one had ten houses with two floors and a paved yard. Very important for the archaeological research are considered the rich [[villa]]s that were excavated in the aristocratic suburb of the city located in the eastern part of the north hill since there was found some of the earliest [[mosaic|floor mosaics]] in [[Greek art]].\n\nBoth the archaic and classical city were protected by an extended land wall. Parts of the foundations of the wall were revealed in the north hill and elsewhere, but they are not enlightening on which method was followed for their construction. Archaeologists suppose that it was built with [[mudbrick|sun-dried bricks]] with a stone base, but it's difficult to tell, since the city was literally leveled by [[Phillip of Macedon|Phillip]].\n\nAs it concerns the public buildings, the [[agora]] is placed in the south edge of the north hill, near the eastern gate, along with a public fountain, an [[arsenal]] and the city's parliament building (\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).

The South Hill bore a small [[Neolithic]] settlement; was abandoned during the [[Bronze Age]]; and was resettled in the 7th century BC. Subsequently, the town was captured by the [[Bottiaea]]ns, a Thracian tribe ejected from Macedon by [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]].\n\nFollowing the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] defeat at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] (480 BC) and with [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] having been escorted to the [[Hellespont]] by his general [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus]], the Persian army spent the winter of the same year in [[Thessaly]] and [[Achaemenid Macedonia|Macedonia]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} The Persian authority in the Balkans must have significantly decreased at the time, which encouraged the inhabitants of the [[Pallene (Chalcidice)|Pallene peninsula]] to break away.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} Suspecting that a revolt against the Great King was meditated, in order to control the situation, Artabazus captured Olynthus, which was thought to be disloyal, and killed its inhabitants.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|page=139}} The town had priorly been given to Kritovoulos from [[Toroni]] and to a fresh population consisting of Greeks from the neighboring region of Chalcidice, who had been exiled by the Macedonians ([[Herodotus|Herod.]] viii. 127). Though Herodotus reports that Artabazus slaughtered them, Boetiaeans continued to live in the area.\n\nOlynthus became a Greek polis, but it remained insignificant (in the quota-lists of the [[Delian League]] it appears as paying on the average 2 talents, as compared with 6 to 15 paid by [[Nea Skioni|Scione]], 6 to 15 by [[Mende (Greece)|Mende]], 6 to 12 by [[Toroni]], and 3 to 6 by [[Ormylia|Sermylia]] from 454 to 432).\n\nIn 432 King [[Perdiccas II of Macedon]] encouraged several nearby coastal towns to disband and remove their population to Olynthus, preparatory to a revolt to be led by Potidaea against Athens ([[Thucydides|Thuc.]] 1.58). This [[synoecism]] (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2) was effected, though against Perdiccas's wishes the contributing cities were preserved.  This increase in population led to the settlement of the North Hill, which was developed on a [[Hippodamus of Miletus|Hippodamian grid plan]].  In 423 Olynthus became the head of a formal [[Chalkidian League]], occasioned by the synoecism or by the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] and fear of Athenian attack.  During the Peloponnesian war it formed a base for [[Brasidas]] in his expedition of 424 and refuge for the citizens of [[Mende (Chalcidice)|Mende]] and [[Potidaea|Poteidaea]] that had rebelled against the Athenians ([[Thucydides|Thu.]] ii, 70).\n\nAfter the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] the development of the league was rapid and ended consisting of 32 cities. About 393 we find it concluding an important treaty with [[Amyntas III of Macedon]] (the father of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]), and by 382 it had absorbed most of the Greek cities west of the Strymon, and had even got possession of [[Pella]], the chief city in [[Macedon]]. (Xenophon, Hell. V. 2, 12).\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tetradrachm from Olynthus.jpg|thumb|300px|Tetradrachm from Olynthus.

After three years of indecisive warfare Olynthus consented to dissolve the confederacy (379).  It is clear, however, that the dissolution was little more than formal, as the Chalcidians (\"\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03b4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u00f2 \u0398\u03c1\u1fb4\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2\") appear, only a year or two later, among the members of the Athenian naval confederacy of 378-377.  Twenty years later, in the reign of Philip, the power of Olynthus is asserted by [[Demosthenes]] to have been much greater than before the Spartan expedition.  The town itself at this period is spoken of as a city of the first rank (\u03c0\u00f3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bcu\u03c1\u1f30\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), and the league included thirty-two cities.\n\nWhen the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Athens and its allies (357), Olynthus was at first in alliance with Philip. Subsequently, in alarm at the growth of his power, it concluded an alliance with Athens. Olynthus made three embassies to Athens, the occasions of Demosthenes's three [[Olynthiacs|Olynthiac Orations]].  On the third, the Athenians sent soldiers from among its citizens.  After Philip had deprived Olynthus of the rest of the League, by force and by the treachery of sympathetic factions, he besieged Olynthus in 348.  The siege was short; he bought Olynthus's two principal citizens, Euthycrates and Lasthenes,<ref>http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0003:chapter=2:sect=3:subsection=4</ref> who betrayed the city to him.

The name of the settlement is not known, but it seems to have been of a certain importance, presumably reflecting the presence of a bridge across the Aar River. The Roman settlement was probably destroyed in the later 3rd century.\nAt the end of the 3rd century, a fortification was built at the bridge-head, on the south-eastern corner of the earlier vicus. This fortress was abandoned in the 4th century, and later replaced by a larger [[castrum|castle]], comparable to late Roman fortresses protecting crossings of the Aar at Solothurn and Brugg.\n\nThe medieval settlement was built on the foundations of the Roman castle. It is first mentioned in 1201, as ''Oltun'' (conjectured as continuing an ''*Olodunum'', with the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] suffix ''[[dun]]um'' \"fort\", and a prefix ''olo-'', possibly from a hydronym, thus \"river-fort\").<ref>Der Geschichtsfreund: Mitteilungen des Historischen Vereins der f\u00fcnf Orte Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden und Zug, vols. 126-130  (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0eBlAAAAIAAJ&q=Olodunum&dq=Olodunum&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2ZTrUufhMrTQ7AavuID4Bg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ p. 257].</ref>\nIt was in possession of the counts of [[House of Frohburg|Frohburg]] in the 13th century, passing to [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] in 1377 and to [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] in 1384.\nOlten passed under the  administration of Basel in 1407, which invested in infrastructure, which was however destroyed  in fires in 1411 and 1422. Basel lost interest in rebuilding the town again after the 1422 fire, and sold the settlement to [[Solothurn]] in 1426.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Olten was little more than a fortified bridge-head with some services (blacksmiths, taverns); its total population is estimated to about 500 people for the year 1600. Olten lost its city rights in 1653 as punishment for its support of the rebels in the [[Swiss Peasant War]].\nThis resulted in a lasting tradition of resistance against authority in Olten, and the town welcomed as liberators the French troops in the [[French invasion of Switzerland|1798 invasion]]. In 1814, Solothurn suppressed another rebellion of Olten patriots against the [[Swiss Restauration]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOlten first reached a population of 1,000 in the later 18th century. More rapid growth set in after the introduction of the railway in 1856, and the town became an industrial and infrastructural center, reaching 7,000 by 1900. By the 1880s, Olten had developed into a second urban center in the canton, and attracted more infrastructure such as the cantonal hospital (1880), a business school (1912), a cantonal gymnasium (1938). Population tripled again during the 20th century, reaching 21,000 in 1970, but has slightly decreased since.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Olten-altstadt-1.jpg|thumb|left|Aare river at the old city of Olten]]\nOlten has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|11.49|km2|sqmi|abbr=out}}.

The name of the settlement is not known, but it seems to have been of a certain importance, presumably reflecting the presence of a bridge across the Aar River. The Roman settlement was probably destroyed in the later 3rd century.\nAt the end of the 3rd century, a fortification was built at the bridge-head, on the south-eastern corner of the earlier vicus. This fortress was abandoned in the 4th century, and later replaced by a larger [[castrum|castle]], comparable to late Roman fortresses protecting crossings of the Aar at Solothurn and Brugg.\n\nThe medieval settlement was built on the foundations of the Roman castle. It is first mentioned in 1201, as ''Oltun'' (conjectured as continuing an ''*Olodunum'', with the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] suffix ''[[dun]]um'' \"fort\", and a prefix ''olo-'', possibly from a hydronym, thus \"river-fort\").<ref>Der Geschichtsfreund: Mitteilungen des Historischen Vereins der f\u00fcnf Orte Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden und Zug, vols. 126-130  (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0eBlAAAAIAAJ&q=Olodunum&dq=Olodunum&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2ZTrUufhMrTQ7AavuID4Bg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ p. 257].</ref>\nIt was in possession of the counts of [[House of Frohburg|Frohburg]] in the 13th century, passing to [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] in 1377 and to [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] in 1384.\nOlten passed under the  administration of Basel in 1407, which invested in infrastructure, which was however destroyed  in fires in 1411 and 1422. Basel lost interest in rebuilding the town again after the 1422 fire, and sold the settlement to [[Solothurn]] in 1426.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Olten was little more than a fortified bridge-head with some services (blacksmiths, taverns); its total population is estimated to about 500 people for the year 1600. Olten lost its city rights in 1653 as punishment for its support of the rebels in the [[Swiss Peasant War]].\nThis resulted in a lasting tradition of resistance against authority in Olten, and the town welcomed as liberators the French troops in the [[French invasion of Switzerland|1798 invasion]]. In 1814, Solothurn suppressed another rebellion of Olten patriots against the [[Swiss Restauration]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOlten first reached a population of 1,000 in the later 18th century. More rapid growth set in after the introduction of the railway in 1856, and the town became an industrial and infrastructural center, reaching 7,000 by 1900. By the 1880s, Olten had developed into a second urban center in the canton, and attracted more infrastructure such as the cantonal hospital (1880), a business school (1912), a cantonal gymnasium (1938). Population tripled again during the 20th century, reaching 21,000 in 1970, but has slightly decreased since.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Olten-altstadt-1.jpg|thumb|left|Aare river at the old city of Olten]]\nOlten has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|11.49|km2|sqmi|abbr=out}}.

It was previously in the [[Olsztyn Voivodeship]].\n\n==Olsztyn Castle==\n[[File:KOS p\u00f3\u0142nocne skrzyd\u0142o zamku w Olsztynie.jpg|thumb|left|Olsztyn Castle courtyard]]\nThe castle was built between 1346\u20131353 and by then it had one wing on the north-east side of the rectangular courtyard. Access to the castle lead from the drawbridge over the river \u0141yna, surrounded by a belt of defensive walls and a moat. The south-west wing of the castle was built in the 15th century, the tower situated in the west corner of the courtyard, from the middle of the 14th century, was rebuilt in the early 16th century  and had a round shape on a square base and was 40 meters high. At the same time the castle walls were raised to a height of 12 meters and a second belt of the lower walls was built. The castle walls were partly combined with city walls, which made the castle look like it had been a powerful bastion defending access to the city. \nThe castle was owned by Warmia Chapter, which until 1454, together with the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]], was under military protection of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and their [[State of the Teutonic Order|Monastic State of Prussia]].\n\n[[File:647373 Olsztyn zamek-wn\u0119trza01.JPG|thumb|Interior of the Olsztyn Castle]]\nThe castle had played a huge role in the Polish-Teutonic wars by then. After the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, the Poles took it after a few days siege. In the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)]] it was jumping from rule to rule. The Knights threatened the castle and the town in 1521, but the defence was very effective. They contained one failed assault. There is a connection between the history of the castle, the city of Olsztyn, and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He prepared the defence of Olsztyn against the invasion of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, there were two prince-bishops of Warmia that stayed there: [[Johannes Dantiscus]] \u2013 the first [[Sarmatism|sarmatian]] poet, endowed with the imperial laurel wreath for \"Latin Songs\" (1538, 1541) and [[Marcin Kromer]], who wrote with equal ease in Latin and Polish scientific and literary works (1580). Kromer consecrated the chapel of St. Anna, which was built in the south-west wing of the castle. In the course of time both wings of the castle lost military importance, which for residential purposes has become very convenient. In 1779 Prince-Bishop [[Ignacy Krasicki]] stopped here as well.\n\nAfter the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] annexation of Warmia during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, the castle became the property of the state board of estates (War and Domain Chamber, Kriegs- und Dom\u00e4nenkammer). In 1845 the bridge over the moat was replaced by a dam better connecting the castle with the city. In 1901\u20131911 a general renovation of the castle was performed, however several sections of the building were violated at the same time where they changed the original look of the castle e.g. putting on window frames in a cloister. The tower was crowned in 1921 and again in 1926 in the halls of the castle, became a museum.\n\nIn 1945 the whole castle became home to the Masurian Museum, which today is called the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. In addition there are also popular events held within the frameworks of the Olsztyn Artistic Summer and so called \"evenings of the castle\" and \"Sundays in the Museum\".\n\n===Jewish community===\n\nThough [[Jews]] did trade in the city fairs during [[medieval]] times, they were not allowed to trade freely in the villages surrounding the city.<ref>W.

Following [[World War II]], the city returned to Poland in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]].\n\nSince 1999 Olsztyn has been the capital city of the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmia-Masuria]].

Access to the castle lead from the drawbridge over the river \u0141yna, surrounded by a belt of defensive walls and a moat. The south-west wing of the castle was built in the 15th century, the tower situated in the west corner of the courtyard, from the middle of the 14th century, was rebuilt in the early 16th century  and had a round shape on a square base and was 40 meters high. At the same time the castle walls were raised to a height of 12 meters and a second belt of the lower walls was built. The castle walls were partly combined with city walls, which made the castle look like it had been a powerful bastion defending access to the city. \nThe castle was owned by Warmia Chapter, which until 1454, together with the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]], was under military protection of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and their [[State of the Teutonic Order|Monastic State of Prussia]].\n\n[[File:647373 Olsztyn zamek-wn\u0119trza01.JPG|thumb|Interior of the Olsztyn Castle]]\nThe castle had played a huge role in the Polish-Teutonic wars by then. After the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, the Poles took it after a few days siege. In the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)]] it was jumping from rule to rule. The Knights threatened the castle and the town in 1521, but the defence was very effective. They contained one failed assault. There is a connection between the history of the castle, the city of Olsztyn, and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He prepared the defence of Olsztyn against the invasion of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, there were two prince-bishops of Warmia that stayed there: [[Johannes Dantiscus]] \u2013 the first [[Sarmatism|sarmatian]] poet, endowed with the imperial laurel wreath for \"Latin Songs\" (1538, 1541) and [[Marcin Kromer]], who wrote with equal ease in Latin and Polish scientific and literary works (1580). Kromer consecrated the chapel of St. Anna, which was built in the south-west wing of the castle. In the course of time both wings of the castle lost military importance, which for residential purposes has become very convenient. In 1779 Prince-Bishop [[Ignacy Krasicki]] stopped here as well.\n\nAfter the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] annexation of Warmia during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, the castle became the property of the state board of estates (War and Domain Chamber, Kriegs- und Dom\u00e4nenkammer). In 1845 the bridge over the moat was replaced by a dam better connecting the castle with the city. In 1901\u20131911 a general renovation of the castle was performed, however several sections of the building were violated at the same time where they changed the original look of the castle e.g. putting on window frames in a cloister. The tower was crowned in 1921 and again in 1926 in the halls of the castle, became a museum.\n\nIn 1945 the whole castle became home to the Masurian Museum, which today is called the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. In addition there are also popular events held within the frameworks of the Olsztyn Artistic Summer and so called \"evenings of the castle\" and \"Sundays in the Museum\".\n\n===Jewish community===\n\nThough [[Jews]] did trade in the city fairs during [[medieval]] times, they were not allowed to trade freely in the villages surrounding the city.<ref>W.

In the late 18th century the land became part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in the [[Northwest Territory]], then was purchased by the [[Connecticut Land Company]] in 1795.\n\nIn 1806, the vast tract of land comprising present-day Olmsted Falls, [[North Olmsted]], and [[Olmsted Township]] was purchased for $30,000 by [[Aaron Olmsted]], a wealthy sea captain. While he sold off portions of the land which eventually became known as Kingston, Aaron Olmsted named the new town as Olmsted in honor of his brother Charles, one of the original lands purchasers.  The land was part of a vast trek ceded to the State of Connecticut after the Revolutionary War in payment for residents whose properties had been burned during the Revolutionary War.  Some of those lands became known as the Firelands part of the western reserve lands of Connecticut.\n\nOlmsted Falls was farmed in 1814 by James Geer who eventually build a home the following year about where the CSX Railroad now crosses State Route 252 (Columbia Road).  That portion was known as Westview after Calvin and Lmul Hoadley built a mill on the Rocky River in West View.\n\nThe whole tract purchased by Aaron Olmsted and others included portions of what is now North Olmsted, [[North Ridgeville]] and [[Middleburg Heights]].\n\nIn 1970 a group of residents sought to merge Olmsted Falls and [[Westview Village, Ohio|Westview Village]]. The suggested contract was approved by over 90% of voters in each community.  The name Westview, while not on any historic maps, exists through the comic strip [[Funky Winkerbean]] drawn by West View native [[Tom Batiuk]].\n\nOlmsted Falls was declared a city in 1970, having attained over 5000 residents to qualify under state rules.  The government is non-partisan and is governed by a charter again written by a group of citizens and presented to the electorate for a vote which was approved. \n\nThe town restricts building along the banks of the Rocky River and Plum Creek. It also is physically crossed by two major railroads. CSX a, NE/SW road and Norfolk Southern which is a mainline east\u2013west configuration.  The city's schools are administered by the [[Olmsted Falls City School District]].\n\n[[Vitamix]] World Headquarters is located in Olmsted Falls.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 383\n|1880= 404\n|1890= 342\n|1900= 330\n|1910= 394\n|1920= 374\n|1930= 673\n|1940= 754\n|1950= 1137\n|1960= 2144\n|1970= 2504\n|1980= 5868\n|1990= 6741\n|2000= 7962\n|2010= 9024\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8889\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a_08.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,024 people, 3,684 households, and 2,431 families residing in the city.

In the late 18th century the land became part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in the [[Northwest Territory]], then was purchased by the [[Connecticut Land Company]] in 1795.\n\nIn 1806, the vast tract of land comprising present-day Olmsted Falls, [[North Olmsted]], and [[Olmsted Township]] was purchased for $30,000 by [[Aaron Olmsted]], a wealthy sea captain. While he sold off portions of the land which eventually became known as Kingston, Aaron Olmsted named the new town as Olmsted in honor of his brother Charles, one of the original lands purchasers.  The land was part of a vast trek ceded to the State of Connecticut after the Revolutionary War in payment for residents whose properties had been burned during the Revolutionary War.  Some of those lands became known as the Firelands part of the western reserve lands of Connecticut.\n\nOlmsted Falls was farmed in 1814 by James Geer who eventually build a home the following year about where the CSX Railroad now crosses State Route 252 (Columbia Road).  That portion was known as Westview after Calvin and Lmul Hoadley built a mill on the Rocky River in West View.\n\nThe whole tract purchased by Aaron Olmsted and others included portions of what is now North Olmsted, [[North Ridgeville]] and [[Middleburg Heights]].\n\nIn 1970 a group of residents sought to merge Olmsted Falls and [[Westview Village, Ohio|Westview Village]]. The suggested contract was approved by over 90% of voters in each community.  The name Westview, while not on any historic maps, exists through the comic strip [[Funky Winkerbean]] drawn by West View native [[Tom Batiuk]].\n\nOlmsted Falls was declared a city in 1970, having attained over 5000 residents to qualify under state rules.  The government is non-partisan and is governed by a charter again written by a group of citizens and presented to the electorate for a vote which was approved. \n\nThe town restricts building along the banks of the Rocky River and Plum Creek. It also is physically crossed by two major railroads. CSX a, NE/SW road and Norfolk Southern which is a mainline east-west configuration.  The city's schools are administered by the [[Olmsted Falls City School District]].\n\n[[Vitamix]] World Headquarters is located in Olmsted Falls.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 383\n|1880= 404\n|1890= 342\n|1900= 330\n|1910= 394\n|1920= 374\n|1930= 673\n|1940= 754\n|1950= 1137\n|1960= 2144\n|1970= 2504\n|1980= 5868\n|1990= 6741\n|2000= 7962\n|2010= 9024\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8889\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=Census1870>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a_08.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Census1880>{{cite web|title=Population of Civil Divisions Less than Counties|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-11.pdf|work=Statistics of the Population of the United States at the Tenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1910>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=1910 U.S. Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,024 people, 3,684 households, and 2,431 families residing in the city.
