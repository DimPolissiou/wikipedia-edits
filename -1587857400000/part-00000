The defeat has been attributed to a serious head injury (concussion from a tournament in January 2018<ref>https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/05/16/helen-maroulis-wrestling-concussion/</ref>). As Maroulis stated in post-match interview \u201cI\u2019m so used to telling someone, hey, don\u2019t touch my head.\u201d The injury was significant enough to cause Maroulis to delay her world team qualifier match, and significantly limited her live sparring prior to the event. It is reported that she was so limited by the injury that she only returned to live practice about 10 days before her rescheduled qualifying series. <ref>https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/10/24/helen-maroulis-wrestling-world-championships/</ref>\n\n==Match results==\n{{s-start}}\n! colspan=\"7\"| World Championships & Olympics\n|-\n!

It became an integral part of the Socrates I (1994\u20131999) and Socrates II (2000\u20132006) programmes. From 2007 it became one of the elements of the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007\u20132013).\n\nAs of 2014, 27 years after its creation, the programme has promoted the mobility of more than 3.3 million students within the European community. More than 4,000 university institutions from 31 countries are participating in the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/education/library/statistics/erasmus-plus-facts-figures_en.pdf|title=ErasmusFacts, Figures & Trends|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{needs update|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Erasmus Programme, together with a number of other independent programmes, was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] established by the European Commission in 1994. The Socrates programme ended on 31 December 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme on 24 January 2000, which in turn was replaced by the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013]] on 1 January 2007.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]\n\n===Origins of the name===\nThe programme is named after the Dutch philosopher, theologian, [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist]], [[monk]], and devout [[Roman Catholic]], [[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]], called \"the crowning glory of the Christian humanists\".<ref name=\"ERASMUS-ProgHist\"/> Erasmus, along with his good friend [[Thomas More]], became one of the main figures of European intellectual life during the Renaissance. Known for his satire, Erasmus urged internal reform of the Catholic Church. He encouraged a recovery of the Catholic [[Patristic]] tradition against what he considered to be contemporary abuses of the [[Sacraments]] and certain excessive devotional practices. He famously clashed with Protestant revolutionary [[Martin Luther]] on the subject of free will. ERASMUS is a [[backronym]] meaning '''''E'''u'''R'''opean community '''A'''ction '''S'''cheme for the '''M'''obility of '''U'''niversity '''S'''tudents''.<ref name=\"ERASMUS-ProgHist\"/>\n\n===1987 European Commission proposal===\nBy the time the Erasmus Programme was adopted in June 1987, the [[European Commission]] had been supporting pilot student exchanges for 6 years. It proposed the original Erasmus Programme in early 1986, but reaction from the then Member States varied: those with substantial exchange programmes of their own (essentially France, Germany and the United Kingdom) were broadly hostile{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}; the remaining countries were broadly in favour. Exchanges between the [[Member States]] and the [[European Commission]] deteriorated, and the latter withdrew the proposal in early 1987 to protest against the inadequacy of the triennial budget proposed by some Member States.<ref name=\"ERASMUS-ProgHist\"/>\n\n===European Court of Justice decision===\nThis method of voting was not accepted by some of the opposing Member States, who challenged the adoption of the decision before the [[European Court of Justice]]. Although the Court held that the adoption was procedurally flawed, it maintained the substance of the decision; a further decision, adapted in the light of the jurisprudence, was rapidly adopted by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]].\n\n===Adoption and growth===\nThe programme built on the 1981\u20131986 pilot student exchanges, and although it was formally adopted only shortly before the beginning of the academic year 1987\u20131988, it was still possible for 3,244 students to participate in Erasmus in its first year. In 2006, over 150,000 students, or almost 1% of the European student population, took part. The proportion is higher among university teachers, where Erasmus teacher mobility is 1.9% of the teacher population in Europe, or 20,877 people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nIn the past twenty years,{{when|date=January 2020}} over two million students<ref name=\"Survey of the Socio-Economic Background of Erasmus Students - DG EAC 01/05\">[http://ec.europa.eu/education/erasmus/doc920_en.htm Ec.europa.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211164532/http://ec.europa.eu/education/erasmus/doc920_en.htm |date=11 December 2008 }}, Table: Erasmus student mobility (number of outgoing students): 1987/88-2006/07</ref> have benefited from Erasmus grants, and the European Commission aims to reach a total of 3&nbsp;million by 2012.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In 2004 Erasmus Programme is awarded the [[Princess of Asturias Awards#Prince/Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation|Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation]].\n\n===Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013===\nThe [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013]] replaced the Socrates programme as the overall umbrella under which the Erasmus (and other) programmes operate from 2007.\n\n===Erasmus Mundus===\n{{Main|Erasmus Mundus}}\nThe [[Erasmus Mundus]] programme is another, parallel programme that is oriented towards globalising European education.

It became an integral part of the Socrates I (1994\u20131999) and Socrates II (2000\u20132006) programmes. From 2007 it became one of the elements of the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007\u20132013).\n\nAs of 2014, 27 years after its creation, the programme has promoted the mobility of more than 3.3 million students within the European community. More than 4,000 university institutions from 31 countries are participating in the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/education/library/statistics/erasmus-plus-facts-figures_en.pdf|title=ErasmusFacts, Figures & Trends|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{needs update|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Erasmus Programme, together with a number of other independent programmes, was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] established by the European Commission in 1994. The Socrates programme ended on 31 December 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme on 24 January 2000, which in turn was replaced by the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013]] on 1 January 2007.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]\n\n===Origins of the name===\nThe programme is named after the Dutch philosopher, theologian, [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist]], [[monk]], and devout [[Roman Catholic]], [[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]], called \"the crowning glory of the Christian humanists\".<ref name=\"ERASMUS-ProgHist\"/> Erasmus, along with his good friend [[Thomas More]], became one of the main figures of European intellectual life during the Renaissance. Known for his satire, Erasmus urged internal reform of the Catholic Church. He encouraged a recovery of the Catholic [[Patristic]] tradition against what he considered to be contemporary abuses of the [[Sacraments]] and certain excessive devotional practices. He famously clashed with Protestant revolutionary [[Martin Luther]] on the subject of free will.

It proposed the original Erasmus Programme in early 1986, but reaction from the then Member States varied: those with substantial exchange programmes of their own (essentially France, Germany and the United Kingdom) were broadly hostile{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}; the remaining countries were broadly in favour. Exchanges between the [[Member States]] and the [[European Commission]] deteriorated, and the latter withdrew the proposal in early 1987 to protest against the inadequacy of the triennial budget proposed by some Member States.<ref name=\"ERASMUS-ProgHist\"/>\n\n===European Court of Justice decision===\nThis method of voting was not accepted by some of the opposing Member States, who challenged the adoption of the decision before the [[European Court of Justice]]. Although the Court held that the adoption was procedurally flawed, it maintained the substance of the decision; a further decision, adapted in the light of the jurisprudence, was rapidly adopted by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]].\n\n===Adoption and growth===\nThe programme built on the 1981\u20131986 pilot student exchanges, and although it was formally adopted only shortly before the beginning of the academic year 1987\u20131988, it was still possible for 3,244 students to participate in Erasmus in its first year. In 2006, over 150,000 students, or almost 1% of the European student population, took part.
