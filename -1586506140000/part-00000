Among quadric surfaces, an ellipsoid is characterized by either of the two following properties. Every planar [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is either an [[ellipse]], or is empty, or is reduced to a single point (this explains the name, meaning \"ellipse like\"). It is [[bounded set|bounded]], which means that it may be enclosed in a sufficiently large [[sphere]].\n\nAn ellipsoid has three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]] which intersect at a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], called the center of the ellipsoid. The [[line segment]]s that are delimited on the axes of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called the ''principal axes'', or simply axes of the ellipsoid. If the three axes have different lengths, the ellipsoid is said to be ''tri-axial'' or rarely ''scalene'', and the axes are uniquely defined.\n\nIf two of the axes have the same length, then the ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of [[surface of revolution|revolution]], also called a [[spheroid]]. In this case, the ellipsoid is invariant under a [[rotation]] around the third axis, and there are thus infinitely many ways of choosing the two perpendicular axes of the same length. If the third axis is shorter, the ellipsoid is an [[oblate spheroid]]; if it is longer, it is a [[prolate spheroid]]. If the three axes have the same length, the ellipsoid is a [[sphere]].\n\n==Standard equation==\nUsing a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the origin is the center of the ellipsoid and the coordinate axes are axes of the ellipsoid, the [[implicit surface|implicit equation]] of the ellipsoid has the standard form\n:<math>{x^2 \\over a^2}+{y^2 \\over b^2}+{z^2 \\over c^2}=1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are positive [[real number]]s.\n\nThe points {{math|(''a'', 0, 0)}}, {{math|(0, ''b'', 0)}} and {{math|(0, 0, ''c'')}} lie on the surface. The line segments from the origin to these points are called the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid, because {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are half the length of the principal axes. They correspond to the [[semi-major axis]] and [[semi-minor axis]] of an [[ellipse]].\n\nIf <math>a=b>c,</math> one has an [[oblate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b<c,</math> one has a [[prolate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b=c,</math> one has a [[sphere]].\n\n== Parameterization  ==\nThe ellipsoid may be parameterized in several ways, which are simpler to express when the ellipsoid axes coincide with coordinate axes.

This can be seen experimentally by throwing an eraser with some spin. In addition, [[moment of inertia]] considerations mean that rotation along the major axis is more easily perturbed than rotation along the minor axis.<ref>Goldstein, H G (1980). ''Classical Mechanics'', (2nd edition) Chapter 5.</ref>\n\nOne practical effect of this is that scalene astronomical bodies such as {{dp|Haumea}} generally rotate along their minor axes (as does Earth, which is merely oblate); in addition, because of [[tidal locking]], moons in [[synchronous orbit]] such as [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] orbit with their major axis aligned radially to their planet.\n\nA spinning body of homogeneous self-gravitating fluid will assume the form of either a [[Maclaurin spheroid]] (oblate spheroid) or [[Jacobi ellipsoid]] (scalene ellipsoid) when in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and for moderate rates of rotation.

Among quadric surfaces, an ellipsoid is characterized by either of the two following properties. Every planar [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is either an [[ellipse]], or is empty, or is reduced to a single point (this explains the name, meaning \"ellipse like\"). It is [[bounded set|bounded]], which means that it may be enclosed in a sufficiently large [[sphere]].\n\nAn ellipsoid has three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]] which intersect at a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], called the center of the ellipsoid. The [[line segment]]s that are delimited on the axes of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called the ''principal axes'', or simply axes of the ellipsoid. If the three axes have different lengths, the ellipsoid is said to be ''tri-axial'' or rarely ''scalene'', and the axes are uniquely defined.\n\nIf two of the axes have the same length, then the ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of [[surface of revolution|revolution]], also called a [[spheroid]]. In this case, the ellipsoid is invariant under a [[rotation]] around the third axis, and there are thus infinitely many ways of choosing the two perpendicular axes of the same length. If the third axis is shorter, the ellipsoid is an [[oblate spheroid]]; if it is longer, it is a [[prolate spheroid]]. If the three axes have the same length, the ellipsoid is a [[sphere]].\n\n==Standard equation==\nUsing a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the origin is the center of the ellipsoid and the coordinate axes are axes of the ellipsoid, the [[implicit surface|implicit equation]] of the ellipsoid has the standard form\n:<math>{x^2 \\over a^2}+{y^2 \\over b^2}+{z^2 \\over c^2}=1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are positive [[real number]]s.\n\nThe points {{math|(''a'', 0, 0)}}, {{math|(0, ''b'', 0)}} and {{math|(0, 0, ''c'')}} lie on the surface. The line segments from the origin to these points are called the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid, because {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are half the length of the principal axes. They correspond to the [[semi-major axis]] and [[semi-minor axis]] of an [[ellipse]].\n\nIf <math>a=b>c,</math> one has an [[oblate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b<c,</math> one has a [[prolate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b=c,</math> one has a [[sphere]].\n\n== Parameterization  ==\nThe ellipsoid may be parameterized in several ways, which are simpler to express when the ellipsoid axes coincide with coordinate axes.

This can be seen experimentally by throwing an eraser with some spin. In addition, [[moment of inertia]] considerations mean that rotation along the major axis is more easily perturbed than rotation along the minor axis.<ref>Goldstein, H G (1980). ''Classical Mechanics'', (2nd edition) Chapter 5.</ref>\n\nOne practical effect of this is that scalene astronomical bodies such as {{dp|Haumea}} generally rotate along their minor axes (as does Earth, which is merely oblate); in addition, because of [[tidal locking]], moons in [[synchronous orbit]] such as [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] orbit with their major axis aligned radially to their planet.\n\nA spinning body of homogeneous self-gravitating fluid will assume the form of either a [[Maclaurin spheroid]] (oblate spheroid) or [[Jacobi ellipsoid]] (scalene ellipsoid) when in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and for moderate rates of rotation.  At faster rotations, non-ellipsoidal [[:wikt:pyriform|piriform]] or [[oviform]] shapes can be expected, but these are not stable.\n\n===Fluid dynamics===\n\nThe ellipsoid is the most general shape for which it has been possible to calculate the [[creeping flow]] of fluid around the solid shape. The calculations include the force required to translate through a fluid and to rotate within it. Applications include determining the size and shape of large molecules, the sinking rate of small particles, and the swimming abilities of [[microorganisms]].<ref>Dusenbery, David B. (2009).''Living at Micro Scale'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{isbn|978-0-674-03116-6}}.</ref>\n\n===In probability and statistics===\n\nThe [[elliptical distribution]]s, which generalize the [[multivariate normal distribution]] and are used in [[finance]], can be defined in terms of their [[density function]]s.  When they exist, the density functions ''f'' have the structure:\n:<math>f(x)= k \\cdot g((x-\\mu)\\Sigma^{-1}(x-\\mu)^\\mathrm{T})</math>\nwhere <math>k</math> is a scale factor, <math>x</math> is an <math>n</math>-dimensional [[random vector|random row vector]] with median vector <math>\\mu</math> (which is also the mean vector if the latter exists),  <math>\\Sigma</math> is a [[positive definite matrix]] which is proportional to the [[covariance matrix]] if the latter exists, and <math>g</math> is a function mapping from the non-negative reals to the non-negative reals giving a finite area under the curve.<ref>Frahm, G., Junker, M., & Szimayer, A. (2003). Elliptical copulas: applicability and limitations. Statistics & Probability Letters, 63(3), 275\u2013286.</ref> The multivariate normal distribution is the special case in which <math>g(z)=e^{-z/2}</math> for quadratic form <math>z</math>.\n\nThus the density function is a scalar-to-scalar transformation of a quadric expression. Moreover, the equation for any [[contour line|iso-density surface]] states that the quadric expression equals some constant specific to that value of the density, and the iso-density surface is an ellipsoid.\n\n== In higher dimensions ==\nThe volume of a higher-dimensional ellipsoid (a ''hyperellipsoid'') can be calculated using the dimensional constant given for the [[Volume of an n-ball|volume of a hypersphere]].\nOne can also define hyperellipsoids as the images of spheres under invertible linear transformations.

Both years, they were beaten by the [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois Salukis]].<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson's future Knicks teammate [[Walt Frazier]] was the Salukis' biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966.\n\n==NBA playing career==\n[[File:Phil Jackson 1968.jpeg|thumb|150px|Jackson circa 1968]]\nIn [[1967 NBA draft|1967]], Jackson was drafted in the second round by the [[New York Knicks]]. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense.<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1973]]. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969\u201370 championship season due to [[spinal fusion]] surgery; however, he authored a book entitled ''Take It All'', a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.\n\nSoon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup.<ref name=Halberstam/> In the [[1974\u201375 NBA season]], Jackson and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]' [[Bob Dandridge]] shared the lead for total [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]], with 330 each.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1975_stats.html 1974\u201375 NBA Player Register], basketball-reference.com</ref> Jackson lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], during this time.<ref>Adamek, Steve; and Iannazzone, Al.

While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the [[Albany Patroons]] to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the [[Piratas de Quebradillas]] (1984 and 1987) and the [[Gallitos de Isabela]] (1984\u20131986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the [[counterculture]] during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.<ref name=\"Halberstam\"/>\n\n===Chicago Bulls (1987\u20131998)===\nIn 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. He was promoted to [[head coach]] in 1989. It was around this time that he met [[Tex Winter]] and became a devotee of Winter's [[triangle offense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktka.com/news/2007/feb/22/Former_K_State_basketball/|publisher=KTKA.com|work=ABC News|title=Former K-State basketball star dies at 72|date=February 22, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|work=Canada Basketball|title=Candidates for the 2007 Class of the FIBA Hall of Fame announced|date=May 25, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212173724/http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|archivedate=February 12, 2008}}</ref> Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.\n\nJackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]], defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], [[2008\u201309 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] 4\u20131, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and [[Red Auerbach]].\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. They defeated the [[2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season|Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[2009\u201310 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], and [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the playoffs before defeating the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the [[2010 NBA Finals]], earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=June 17, 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AgEulkIpjiJ1N3Saog.Z3rzYrYZ4?slug=ap-lakers-jackson Phil Jackson returning to coach Lakers next season] Yahoo!

He then coached the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] from 1999 to 2004 and again from 2005 to 2011; the team won five NBA championships under his leadership. Jackson's 11 [[List of NBA championship head coaches|NBA titles as a coach]] surpassed the previous record of nine set by [[Red Auerbach]]. He also holds the NBA record for the most combined championships, winning a total of 13 as a player and a coach.\n\nJackson is known for his use of [[Tex Winter]]'s [[triangle offense]] as well as a [[holistic]] approach to coaching that was influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]], garnering him the nickname \"[[Zen master|Zen Master]]\". Jackson cited [[Robert Pirsig]]'s book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' as one of the major guiding forces in his life. He also applied Native American spiritual practices, as documented in his book ''Sacred Hoops''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sports/jan-june00/jackson_6-16.html|title=Basketball Court Zen|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref> He is the author of several candid books about his teams and his basketball strategies.

Elisabeth came from a long line of German [[Mennonite]]s before her conversion to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor.<ref name=Halberstam/> Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college.<ref name=Halberstam /> Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.\n\n==High school career==\nJackson attended high school in [[Williston, North Dakota]], where he played varsity basketball and led the team to two state titles. He also played [[American football|football]], was a [[pitcher]] on the baseball team, and threw the [[discus]] in track and field competitions.<ref name=Halberstam/> The high school now has a sports complex named after him.<ref>Burnes, Jerry.

Retrieved August 11, 2015.</ref> His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics because it was the only time they were allowed to do what other children were doing.<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts. Their notes found their way to future NBA coach [[Bill Fitch]], who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the [[University of North Dakota]] in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.<ref name=Halberstam/>\n\n==College career==\n\nBill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the [[University of North Dakota]], where he was a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=Halberstam/><ref name=SAE>[http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts Facts and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106124035/http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts |date=January 6, 2007 }}, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.</ref> Jackson did well there, helping the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball|Fighting Sioux]] to third- and fourth-place finishes in the [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|NCAA Division II tournament]] in his sophomore and junior years ([[1965 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1965]] and [[1966 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1966]]). Both years, they were beaten by the [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois Salukis]].<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson's future Knicks teammate [[Walt Frazier]] was the Salukis' biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966.\n\n==NBA playing career==\n[[File:Phil Jackson 1968.jpeg|thumb|150px|Jackson circa 1968]]\nIn [[1967 NBA draft|1967]], Jackson was drafted in the second round by the [[New York Knicks]]. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense.<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1973]]. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969\u201370 championship season due to [[spinal fusion]] surgery; however, he authored a book entitled ''Take It All'', a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.\n\nSoon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup.<ref name=Halberstam/> In the [[1974\u201375 NBA season]], Jackson and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]' [[Bob Dandridge]] shared the lead for total [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]], with 330 each.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1975_stats.html 1974\u201375 NBA Player Register], basketball-reference.com</ref> Jackson lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], during this time.<ref>Adamek, Steve; and Iannazzone, Al.

While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the [[Albany Patroons]] to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the [[Piratas de Quebradillas]] (1984 and 1987) and the [[Gallitos de Isabela]] (1984\u20131986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the [[counterculture]] during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.<ref name=\"Halberstam\"/>\n\n===Chicago Bulls (1987\u20131998)===\nIn 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. He was promoted to [[head coach]] in 1989. It was around this time that he met [[Tex Winter]] and became a devotee of Winter's [[triangle offense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktka.com/news/2007/feb/22/Former_K_State_basketball/|publisher=KTKA.com|work=ABC News|title=Former K-State basketball star dies at 72|date=February 22, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|work=Canada Basketball|title=Candidates for the 2007 Class of the FIBA Hall of Fame announced|date=May 25, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212173724/http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|archivedate=February 12, 2008}}</ref> Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.\n\nJackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]], defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], [[2008\u201309 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] 4\u20131, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and [[Red Auerbach]].\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. They defeated the [[2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season|Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[2009\u201310 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], and [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the playoffs before defeating the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the [[2010 NBA Finals]], earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=June 17, 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AgEulkIpjiJ1N3Saog.Z3rzYrYZ4?slug=ap-lakers-jackson Phil Jackson returning to coach Lakers next season] Yahoo!

His family moved when he was a child to the industrial city of [[Buffalo, New York]], during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. After attending local schools, Reed attended the [[State University of New York at Buffalo|University at Buffalo]], a private university that became part of the state public university system after he left. Reed withdrew from university in his junior year, partly due to financial issues, but mainly because he felt he needed a new atmosphere to support his writing and music. He comments on this decision:\n\n<blockquote>This was the best thing that could have happened to me at the time because I was able to continue experimenting along the lines I wanted, influenced by [Nathanael] [[Nathanael West|West]] and others. I didn't want to be a slave to somebody else's reading lists. I kind of regret the decision now because I've gotten some of the most racist and horrible things said to me because of this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gates, Jr.|first1=Henry Louis|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company Inc.|location=New York|pages=798\u2013801|edition=3rd|date=2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1995, the college awarded him an honorary doctorate degree.\n\nIn 1998, Reed spoke about his influences in an interview:\n\n<blockquote>I've probably been more influenced by poets than by novelists \u2014 the [[Harlem Renaissance]] poets, the [[Beat Generation|Beat poets]], the American surrealist [[Ted Joans]]. Poets have to be more attuned to originality, coming up with lines and associations the ordinary prose writer wouldn't think of.<ref>Steiner, Andy. [http://www.utne.com/Media/Media-Diet-Ishmael-Reed-African-American-Critics-Internet.aspx \"Media Diet: Ishmael Reed\"], ''Utne Reader'' (September/October 1998).</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe moved to [[New York City]] in 1962 and co-founded with [[Walter Bowart]] the ''[[East Village Other]],'' which became a well-known underground publication. He was also a member of the [[Umbra poets|Umbra Writers Workshop]], some of whose members helped establish the [[Black Arts Movement]] and promoted a Black Aesthetic. Although Reed was never a participant in that movement, he has continued to research the history of black Americans. While working on his novel ''[[Flight to Canada]]'' (published in 1976), he coined the term \"Neo-Slave narrative\", which he used in 1984 in \"A Conversation with Ishmael Reed\" by Reginald Martin.<ref>[http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-ishmael-reed-by-reginald-martin/ \"A Conversation with Ishmael Reed By Reginald Martin\"] (interview conducted July 1\u20137, 1983, in [[Emeryville, California]]), ''The Review of Contemporary Fiction'', Summer 1984, Vol. 4.2. At Dalkey Archive Press.</ref> During this time Reed would also make connections with musicians and poets such as [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]], and [[Albert Ayler]] which later contributed to Reed\u2019s vast experimentation with jazz and his love for music.\n\nIn 1970 Reed moved to the West Coast to begin teaching at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught for 35 years. He retired from there in 2005 and is serving as a Distinguished Professor at [[California College of the Arts]]. He lives in [[Oakland, California]], with his wife of more than 40 years, [[Carla Blank]], a noted author, choreographer, and director.<ref>Carla Blank's latest publication is [http://carlablank.com/ ''Rediscovering America: The Making of Multicultural America, 1900\u20132000''], Three Rivers Press, 2003.</ref>\n\nHis archives are held by the Special Collections at the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]. ''Ishmael Reed: An Exhibition'', curated by Timothy D.

In Chris Jackson's interview of Reed in the Fall 2016 edition of ''[[The Paris Review]]'',<ref>Jackson, Chris, [https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6806/ishmael-reed-the-art-of-poetry-no-100-ishmael-reed \"Ishmael Reed, The Art of Poetry No. 100\"], ''The Paris Review'', No. 218, Fall 2016.</ref> Reed discusses many literary influences, including [[Dante]], the [[Celtic Revival]] poets, [[James Baldwin]], [[George Schuyler]], [[Nathanael West]], [[Bob Kaufman]], and [[Charles Wright (novelist)|Charles Wright]].\n\nWhen discussing his influences on his writing style in ''Writin\u2019 is Fightin\u2019'' he attributed much of it to the warrior tradition he feels is inherent in African and African American culture. Similar contemporary authors that Reed insists deny victim literature with a centralized black male villain are [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Ed Bullins]].\n\nLooking forward in his writing Reed has stated that he wants to sustain Western values but mix them up a little bit to express a sense of multi-culturalism that represents more than just the African American voice. Published in 1993 the novel'', Japanese by Spring'', was Reed\u2019s first trilingual text. The novel used English, Japanese, and Yoruba to better represent his ideas of a more realistic American multi-culturalism. \n\nHis latest novel, ''Conjugating Hindi,'' was deeply compelled by Reed\u2019s ideas of depicting a unification of multiple cultures. In this novel Reed explores the congruencies and differences of African American and South Asian American cultures though political discourse posed by white neo-conservative Americans toward both ethnicities.\n\n==Music==\nIshmael Reed's texts and lyrics have been performed, composed or set to music by [[Albert Ayler]], [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]], [[Allen Toussaint]], Carman Moore, [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Olu Dara]], [[Lester Bowie]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Steve Swallow]], [[Ravi Coltrane]], [[Leo Nocentelli]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Anthony Cox (musician)|Anthony Cox]], [[Don Pullen]], [[Billy Bang]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Milton Cardona]], [[Omar Sosa]], [[Fernando Saunders]], Yosvanni Terry, [[Jack Bruce]], [[Little Jimmy Scott]], Robert Jason, [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] of [[the Supremes]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Gregory Porter]] and others.\n\nReed has been the central participant in the longest ongoing music/poetry collaboration, known as Conjure projects,<ref>[[Jon Pareles|Pareles, Jon]] (September 21, 1983), [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/arts/jazz-ishmael-reed-songs.html \"JAZZ: Ishmael Reed Songs\"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> produced by Kip Hanrahan on American Clav\u00e9: ''Conjure I'' (1984) and ''Conjure II'' (1988), which were reissued by [[Rounder Records]] in 1995; and ''Conjure Bad Mouth'' (2005), whose compositions were developed in live Conjure band performances, from 2003 to 2004, including engagements at [[Paris]]'s [[Banlieues Bleues Festival|Banlieues Bleues]], London's [[Barbican Centre]], and the Blue Note Caf\u00e9 in Tokyo.

His family moved when he was a child to the industrial city of [[Buffalo, New York]], during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. After attending local schools, Reed attended the [[State University of New York at Buffalo|University at Buffalo]], a private university that became part of the state public university system after he left. Reed withdrew from university in his junior year, partly due to financial issues, but mainly because he felt he needed a new atmosphere to support his writing and music. He comments on this decision:\n\n<blockquote>This was the best thing that could have happened to me at the time because I was able to continue experimenting along the lines I wanted, influenced by [Nathanael] [[Nathanael West|West]] and others. I didn't want to be a slave to somebody else's reading lists. I kind of regret the decision now because I've gotten some of the most racist and horrible things said to me because of this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gates, Jr.|first1=Henry Louis|title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|publisher=W.

Poets have to be more attuned to originality, coming up with lines and associations the ordinary prose writer wouldn't think of.<ref>Steiner, Andy.

He was also a member of the [[Umbra poets|Umbra Writers Workshop]], some of whose members helped establish the [[Black Arts Movement]] and promoted a Black Aesthetic. Although Reed was never a participant in that movement, he has continued to research the history of black Americans. While working on his novel ''[[Flight to Canada]]'' (published in 1976), he coined the term \"Neo-Slave narrative\", which he used in 1984 in \"A Conversation with Ishmael Reed\" by Reginald Martin.<ref>[http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-ishmael-reed-by-reginald-martin/ \"A Conversation with Ishmael Reed By Reginald Martin\"] (interview conducted July 1\u20137, 1983, in [[Emeryville, California]]), ''The Review of Contemporary Fiction'', Summer 1984, Vol. 4.2. At Dalkey Archive Press.</ref> During this time Reed would also make connections with musicians and poets such as [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]], and [[Albert Ayler]] which later contributed to Reed\u2019s vast experimentation with jazz and his love for music.\n\nIn 1970 Reed moved to the West Coast to begin teaching at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught for 35 years. He retired from there in 2005 and is serving as a Distinguished Professor at [[California College of the Arts]]. He lives in [[Oakland, California]], with his wife of more than 40 years, [[Carla Blank]], a noted author, choreographer, and director.<ref>Carla Blank's latest publication is [http://carlablank.com/ ''Rediscovering America: The Making of Multicultural America, 1900\u20132000''], Three Rivers Press, 2003.</ref>\n\nHis archives are held by the Special Collections at the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]].

His current publishing imprint is '''Ishmael Reed Publishing Company''', and his online literary publication, '''''Konch Magazine''''', features an international mix of poetry, essays and fiction.<ref>[http://www.ishmaelreedpub.com ''Konch Magazine'']. An Ishmael Reed and Tennessee Reed Publication.</ref>\n\nAmong the writers first published by Reed when they were students in his writing workshops are [[Terry McMillan]], [[Mona Simpson]], [[Mitch Berman]], Kathryn Trueblood, Danny Romero, [[Fae Myenne Ng]], Brynn Saito, Mandy Kahn, and [[John Keene (writer)|John Keene]].\n\nReed is one of the producers of ''[[The Domestic Crusaders]]'', a two-act play about Muslim Pakistani Americans written by his former student, Wajahat Ali.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/theater/09domestic.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=wajahat&st=cse|title=A Pakistani-American Family Is Caught in Some Cultural Cross-Fire|work=The New York Times|last=Goodstein |first= Laurie|date=September 8, 2009}}</ref> Its first act was performed at the [[Kennedy Center]]'s Millennium Hall in Washington, D.C., on November 14, 2010, and remains archived on their website. \n\nCritics have also pointed to Reed's influence on writers [[Percival Everett]],  [[Colson Whitehead]], [[Victor LaValle]] and [[Paul Beatty]]. In Chris Jackson's interview of Reed in the Fall 2016 edition of ''[[The Paris Review]]'',<ref>Jackson, Chris, [https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6806/ishmael-reed-the-art-of-poetry-no-100-ishmael-reed \"Ishmael Reed, The Art of Poetry No. 100\"], ''The Paris Review'', No. 218, Fall 2016.</ref> Reed discusses many literary influences, including [[Dante]], the [[Celtic Revival]] poets, [[James Baldwin]], [[George Schuyler]], [[Nathanael West]], [[Bob Kaufman]], and [[Charles Wright (novelist)|Charles Wright]].\n\nWhen discussing his influences on his writing style in ''Writin\u2019 is Fightin\u2019'' he attributed much of it to the warrior tradition he feels is inherent in African and African American culture. Similar contemporary authors that Reed insists deny victim literature with a centralized black male villain are [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Ed Bullins]].\n\nLooking forward in his writing Reed has stated that he wants to sustain Western values but mix them up a little bit to express a sense of multi-culturalism that represents more than just the African American voice. Published in 1993 the novel'', Japanese by Spring'', was Reed\u2019s first trilingual text. The novel used English, Japanese, and Yoruba to better represent his ideas of a more realistic American multi-culturalism. \n\nHis latest novel, ''Conjugating Hindi,'' was deeply compelled by Reed\u2019s ideas of depicting a unification of multiple cultures. In this novel Reed explores the congruencies and differences of African American and South Asian American cultures though political discourse posed by white neo-conservative Americans toward both ethnicities.\n\n==Music==\nIshmael Reed's texts and lyrics have been performed, composed or set to music by [[Albert Ayler]], [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]], [[Allen Toussaint]], Carman Moore, [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Olu Dara]], [[Lester Bowie]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Steve Swallow]], [[Ravi Coltrane]], [[Leo Nocentelli]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Anthony Cox (musician)|Anthony Cox]], [[Don Pullen]], [[Billy Bang]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Milton Cardona]], [[Omar Sosa]], [[Fernando Saunders]], Yosvanni Terry, [[Jack Bruce]], [[Little Jimmy Scott]], Robert Jason, [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] of [[the Supremes]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Gregory Porter]] and others.\n\nReed has been the central participant in the longest ongoing music/poetry collaboration, known as Conjure projects,<ref>[[Jon Pareles|Pareles, Jon]] (September 21, 1983), [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/arts/jazz-ishmael-reed-songs.html \"JAZZ: Ishmael Reed Songs\"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> produced by Kip Hanrahan on American Clav\u00e9: ''Conjure I'' (1984) and ''Conjure II'' (1988), which were reissued by [[Rounder Records]] in 1995; and ''Conjure Bad Mouth'' (2005), whose compositions were developed in live Conjure band performances, from 2003 to 2004, including engagements at [[Paris]]'s [[Banlieues Bleues Festival|Banlieues Bleues]], London's [[Barbican Centre]], and the Blue Note Caf\u00e9 in Tokyo.

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]].

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]].

The city has a population of 212,000.\n\nThe original settlement may have been on a small island in the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Little Khabur]] river, which flows through the modern city. The Khabur flows west from Zakho to form the border between Iraq and Turkey, continuing into the [[Tigris]].

Colo River flows eastwards and then south through a deep gorge in the northern section of the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]].

The wilderness was saved from development, logging and damming in the late 1970s by the Colo Wilderness Preservation Society and other environmentalists. Emerging from the wilderness region, the lower part of the Colo River flows through a scenic, narrow agricultural valley and reaches the [[Hawkesbury River]] at [[Lower Portland]] north of [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]].

The Colo River gorge contains many boulder-rapids that alternate with deep pools.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as middle-aged actor Bob Harris, who befriends college graduate Charlotte ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) in a [[Tokyo]] hotel. The movie explores themes of [[loneliness]], [[insomnia]], [[Existentialism|existential]] [[ennui]], and [[culture shock]] against the backdrop of a modern Japanese city.\n\n''Lost in Translation'' was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Bill Murray, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola; Coppola won for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Murray and Johansson each won a [[BAFTA]] award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] respectively. The film grossed $119 million on a budget of $4 million.\n\n==Plot==\nBob Harris, an aging American movie star, arrives in Tokyo to film an advertisement for [[Suntory]] whiskey. Charlotte, a young college graduate, sits bored in her hotel room while her husband John, a celebrity photographer, is on assignment in Tokyo. Charlotte is unsure of her future with John, feeling detached from his lifestyle and disillusioned about their relationship. Bob's 25-year marriage is also strained as he goes through a [[midlife crisis]].\n\nEach day, Bob and Charlotte encounter each other in the hotel and after both experience insomnia, they sit and chat at the hotel bar one night. Eventually, Charlotte invites Bob to meet with some local friends of hers. The two bond through a fun night in Tokyo with Charlotte's friends, experiencing Japanese nightlife and culture. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte's friendship develops as they spend more time together. One night, each unable to sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal troubles and Bob's married life.\n\nOn the penultimate night of his stay, Bob sleeps with the hotel bar's female jazz singer. The next morning Charlotte arrives at his room to invite him for lunch and overhears the woman in his room, leading to a difficult lunch. Later that night, outside the hotel during a fire alarm, Bob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other as they make a final visit to the hotel bar.\n\nThe following morning, Bob is set to return to the United States. He tells Charlotte goodbye at the hotel lobby and sadly watches her walk back to the elevator. In a taxi to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte on a crowded street, leaves the car and walks to her. He embraces the tearful Charlotte and whispers something in her ear. The two share a brief kiss, say goodbye and Bob departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Bob Harris\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Charlotte\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as John\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Kelly\n* Fumihiro Hayashi as Charlie Brown\n* Akiko Takeshita as Ms. Kawasaki\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Bois]] as the Pianist\n* [[Takashi Fujii (comedian)|Takashi Fujii]] as TV host\n* [[Hiromix]] as herself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Analysis==\nOver the course of the film, several things are \"lost in translation\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63 |title=What Else Was Lost in Translation |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |last=Rich |first=Motoko |date=September 21, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote= It doesn't take much to figure out that 'Lost in Translation,' the title of Sofia Coppola's elegiac new film about two lonely American souls in Tokyo, means more than one thing.

He wrote that the film's dominant light tones symbolize feelings of humor and romance, and they are contrasted with dark tones that symbolize underlying feelings of despondency.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as midfle-aged actor Bob Harris, who befriends college graduate Charlotte ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) in a [[Tokyo]] hotel. The movie explores themes of [[loneliness]], [[insomnia]], [[Existentialism|existential]] [[ennui]], and [[culture shock]] against the backdrop of a modern Japanese city.\n\n''Lost in Translation'' was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Bill Murray, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola; Coppola won for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Murray and Johansson each won a [[BAFTA]] award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] respectively. The film grossed $119 million on a budget of $4 million.\n\n==Plot==\nBob Harris, an aging American movie star, arrives in Tokyo to film an advertisement for [[Suntory]] whiskey. Charlotte, a young college graduate, sits bored in her hotel room while her husband John, a celebrity photographer, is on assignment in Tokyo. Charlotte is unsure of her future with John, feeling detached from his lifestyle and disillusioned about their relationship. Bob's 25-year marriage is also strained as he goes through a [[midlife crisis]].\n\nEach day, Bob and Charlotte encounter each other in the hotel and after both experience insomnia, they sit and chat at the hotel bar one night. Eventually, Charlotte invites Bob to meet with some local friends of hers. The two bond through a fun night in Tokyo with Charlotte's friends, experiencing Japanese nightlife and culture. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte's friendship develops as they spend more time together. One night, each unable to sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal troubles and Bob's married life.\n\nOn the penultimate night of his stay, Bob sleeps with the hotel bar's female jazz singer. The next morning Charlotte arrives at his room to invite him for lunch and overhears the woman in his room, leading to a difficult lunch. Later that night, outside the hotel during a fire alarm, Bob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other as they make a final visit to the hotel bar.\n\nThe following morning, Bob is set to return to the United States. He tells Charlotte goodbye at the hotel lobby and sadly watches her walk back to the elevator. In a taxi to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte on a crowded street, leaves the car and walks to her. He embraces the tearful Charlotte and whispers something in her ear. The two share a brief kiss, say goodbye and Bob departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Bob Harris\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Charlotte\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as John\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Kelly\n* Fumihiro Hayashi as Charlie Brown\n* Akiko Takeshita as Ms. Kawasaki\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Bois]] as the Pianist\n* [[Takashi Fujii (comedian)|Takashi Fujii]] as TV host\n* [[Hiromix]] as herself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Analysis==\nOver the course of the film, several things are \"lost in translation\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63 |title=What Else Was Lost in Translation |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |last=Rich |first=Motoko |date=September 21, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote= It doesn't take much to figure out that 'Lost in Translation,' the title of Sofia Coppola's elegiac new film about two lonely American souls in Tokyo, means more than one thing.
