He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]]. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight [[Horse length|lengths]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"<ref>Hunter, pg.92</ref>\n\nHis record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|Canadian Juvenile Championship]]. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural. He wasn't quite so seasoned as some of the other horses.\"<ref name=\"Flamingo\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Takes $138,200 Flamingo by 2 Lengths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/04/archives/northern-dancer-takes-138200-flamingo-by-2-lengths-shoemaker-rides.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=4 March 1964}}</ref>\n\nHe then entered a seven-furlong allowance race at [[Gulfstream Park]] on March 28 as a prep for the [[Florida Derby]].

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length. Shoemaker said later that the colt was improving.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer, The Scoundrel \u2013 and Mr. Moon|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/04/13/614442/the-dancer-the-scoundreland-mr-moon|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> However, his time was a disappointing 1:50{{frac|4|5}}, the slowest Florida Derby since 1955. Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]].

Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101\u2013103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by {{frac|7|1|2}} lengths.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}.

He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]].

Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length.

Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J.

The patrol squadrons would rotate assignment to Rota and Lajes every six months and were augmented by [[Naval Reserves|Naval Air Reserve]] patrol squadrons for shorter durations on a periodic basis.\n\nWith the [[Layoff|downsizing]] of the US Navy during the late 1980s and early 1990s, especially after the end of the Cold War, the base's population dramatically declined.

Through the early 1990s, a patrol squadron of [[P-3 Orion]] aircraft based in the United States would also be split-based between NAVSTA Rota and the Naval Air Facility at [[Lajes Air Base]] in the [[Azores]] to track [[Soviet naval]] vessels and submarines in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and in the Mediterranean. The patrol squadrons would rotate assignment to Rota and Lajes every six months and were augmented by [[Naval Reserves|Naval Air Reserve]] patrol squadrons for shorter durations on a periodic basis.\n\nWith the [[Layoff|downsizing]] of the US Navy during the late 1980s and early 1990s, especially after the end of the Cold War, the base's population dramatically declined. The US Navy maintains approximately {{convert|5200|acre|km2}} of the {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} complex. There are about 4,000 Americans in Rota, including military, civilians, and their families.<ref name=\"globalsecurity\" />\n\nAs US Navy started to reduce its presence USAF realized the potential of the airfield as a refuelling stop in Middle East deployments. Rota was used by C-5 and C-141 planes in the Gulf War in 1991. Later the US agreed with Spain to improve air base installations so it could handle more cargo plane operations.\n\nIn April 2011, the commander of the US Navy garrison at the base, Captain William F. Mosk, was relieved of command and reassigned during an investigation into illegal drug use by US servicemen at the installation.  Rear Admiral Tony Gaiani relieved Mosk for \"lost confidence in his ability to command\", specifically, to handle issues related to the investigation.<ref>Jontz, Sandra, \"[http://www.stripes.com/news/naval-station-rota-commander-is-relieved-of-command-1.141449 Naval Station Rota commander is relieved of command]\", ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', 19 April 2011.</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 2011, US Secretary of Defense Panetta announced that the USN will station four [[Aegis Combat System|Aegis]] warships at Rota to strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and bolster the [[missile defense]] of NATO as part of the [[European Phased Adaptive Approach]] (EPAA).

The Naval Station is the only base in the Mediterranean capable of supporting [[Amphibious Readiness Group]] post-deployment wash-downs. The base port also offers secure, pier-side maintenance and back-load facilities. Rota supports Amphibious Readiness Group turnovers and hosts Sailors and Marines from visiting afloat units. The base also provides [[Quality of Life]] support to [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], ARG support sites at [[Palma de Majorca]], [[NATO]] [[headquarters]] in [[Madrid]] and the [[Military Sealift Command]]'s [[Maritime Prepositioning ship|Maritime Prepositioning Squadron 1]].

It remains under the [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flag]] and is commanded by a Spanish [[Vice Admiral]]. While the Spanish Navy is responsible for external security of the base, both Navies are charged with internal security. NAVSTA Rota is technically a tenant facility of the Rota [[Spanish Navy]] base, although as such the USA pays for all the expenses and capital improvements. As a result, certain [[U.S. military]] [[Tradition|customs]] are not observed, such as the display of a [[Flag of the United States|U.S. Flag]], which is only allowed during the annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] celebration or occasionally at half mast as a mark of respect with the [[ad-hoc]] permission of the Spanish Admiral.\n\n===Tenant Commands and Forward-deployed ships===\n* [[Destroyer Squadron 60]] (COMDESRON 60)\n* {{USS|Carney|DDG-64}}\n* {{USS|Ross|DDG-71}}\n* {{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75}}\n* {{USS|Porter|DDG-78}}\n* [[United States Navy EOD|United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] Mobile Unit EIGHT\n\n==Opposition==\nSince the 1980s, various leftist and activist [[pacifist]] groups have marched annually to protest the presence of U.S. and [[Military of Spain|Spanish military]] personnel and equipment at the port of Rota.

It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724 the style had lost currency in Britain.{{Fact|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn the early 18th century, the style was associated with [[Toryism]], the Continent and [[Roman Catholic Church|Popery]] by the dominant [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] aristocracy.

Vanbrugh's final work was [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724 the style had lost currency in Britain.{{Fact|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn the early 18th century, the style was associated with [[Toryism]], the Continent and [[Roman Catholic Church|Popery]] by the dominant [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] aristocracy. At [[Wentworth Woodhouse]], [[Thomas Watson-Wentworth]] and his son [[Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham]] replaced a Jacobean house with a substantial Baroque one in the 1720s, only to find fellow Whigs unimpressed. As a result, a large Palladian building was added, leaving the older one intact.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Downes, Kerry. ''English Baroque Architecture''. London, A.
