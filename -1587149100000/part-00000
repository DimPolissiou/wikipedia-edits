The route travels south on Frederick Douglas Boulevard, which becomes Central Park West at [[110th Street (Manhattan)|West 110th Street]] and [[Frederick Douglass Circle]]. At West 63rd Street in Lincoln Center, southbound buses turn west, then turn south on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], terminating at 57th Street and Broadway just south of Columbus Circle.

At the end of Varick Street in [[Tribeca]], the M20 runs south on [[West Broadway]], then west along [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] past West Street into [[Battery Park City]]. The route then travels along North End Avenue, [[Vesey Street]], a short stretch of West Street, South End Avenue, Battery Place, and State Street.

The route runs mostly along [[Essex Street (Manhattan)|Essex Street]] and [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]] from [[Battery Park City]] to [[Kips Bay, Manhattan|Kips Bay]]. Originally a [[streetcar line]], the Avenue C Line is now part of the M9 route, as well as the M21, which operates on the [[Houston Street Line (surface)|Houston Street Line]]. Both the Avenue C and Houston Street segments were served by a single route, the M21, until June 2010. The M9 and M21 are operated by the [[New York City Transit Authority]], and based out of the [[Michael J. Quill Depot]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Avenue C Railroad]] (changed to the [[Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]] in the early 1880s) was chartered June 3, 1874, and opened the Avenue C Line on October 18, 1869, connecting the [[Pavonia Ferry]] at the foot of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] with the [[Green Point Ferry]] at the foot of East [[10th Street (Manhattan)|10th Street]].<ref>[[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1869/10/16/archives/the-new-railroad-from-river-to-river.html The New Railroad from River to River], October 16, 1869</ref> Its route ran along [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], a [[one-way pair]] of Charlton Street, Prince Street, and [[Stanton Street (Manhattan)|Stanton Street]] (eastbound) and [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]], [[1st Avenue (Manhattan)|1st Avenue]], and [[3rd Street (Manhattan)|3rd Street]] (westbound), Pitt Street/[[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]], and 10th Street. By 1879, the line had been extended north on Avenue C from 10th Street, west on [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]] (eastbound) and [[18th Street (Manhattan)|18th Street]] (westbound), north over the Central Park, North and East River Railroad (First Avenue and East Belt Line) on [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]], [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and [[1st Avenue (Manhattan)|1st Avenue]], west on [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]] (westbound) and [[36th Street (Manhattan)|36th Street]] (eastbound), north on [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]], and west on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]].<!--did it ever serve the 23rd Street Ferry? see [[Talk:Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]]--> The [[Third Avenue Railroad]] also used the trackage on 42nd Street<!--how?--> by 1884.<ref>[[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1884/09/09/archives/street-car-lines-at-law-fighting-for-privileges-in.html Street Car Lines at Law], September 9, 1884</ref>\n\nOn November 29, 1893, the Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad was merged into the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]]. The line was cut back to Avenue A at [[24th Street (Manhattan)|24th Street]] by 1907; the trackage on 35th and 36th Streets was removed, while the other trackage became parts of the [[Lexington Avenue Line (surface)|Lexington Avenue Line]] and 42nd Street Crosstown Line.\n\nBuses were substituted for streetcars<!--by whom?--> in September 1919. Service was suspended, but brought back in March 1929 by the Hamilton Bus Company.

The route runs mostly along [[Essex Street (Manhattan)|Essex Street]] and [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]] from [[Battery Park City]] to [[Kips Bay, Manhattan|Kips Bay]]. Originally a [[streetcar line]], the Avenue C Line is now part of the M9 route, as well as the M21, which operates on the [[Houston Street Line (surface)|Houston Street Line]]. Both the Avenue C and Houston Street segments were served by a single route, the M21, until June 2010. The M9 and M21 are operated by the [[New York City Transit Authority]], and based out of the [[Michael J. Quill Depot]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Avenue C Railroad]] (changed to the [[Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]] in the early 1880s) was chartered June 3, 1874, and opened the Avenue C Line on October 18, 1869, connecting the [[Pavonia Ferry]] at the foot of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] with the [[Green Point Ferry]] at the foot of East [[10th Street (Manhattan)|10th Street]].<ref>[[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1869/10/16/archives/the-new-railroad-from-river-to-river.html The New Railroad from River to River], October 16, 1869</ref> Its route ran along [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], a [[one-way pair]] of Charlton Street, Prince Street, and [[Stanton Street (Manhattan)|Stanton Street]] (eastbound) and [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]], [[1st Avenue (Manhattan)|1st Avenue]], and [[3rd Street (Manhattan)|3rd Street]] (westbound), Pitt Street/[[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]], and 10th Street. By 1879, the line had been extended north on Avenue C from 10th Street, west on [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]] (eastbound) and [[18th Street (Manhattan)|18th Street]] (westbound), north over the Central Park, North and East River Railroad (First Avenue and East Belt Line) on [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]], [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and [[1st Avenue (Manhattan)|1st Avenue]], west on [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]] (westbound) and [[36th Street (Manhattan)|36th Street]] (eastbound), north on [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]], and west on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]].<!--did it ever serve the 23rd Street Ferry? see [[Talk:Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]]--> The [[Third Avenue Railroad]] also used the trackage on 42nd Street<!--how?--> by 1884.<ref>[[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1884/09/09/archives/street-car-lines-at-law-fighting-for-privileges-in.html Street Car Lines at Law], September 9, 1884</ref>\n\nOn November 29, 1893, the Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad was merged into the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]]. The line was cut back to Avenue A at [[24th Street (Manhattan)|24th Street]] by 1907; the trackage on 35th and 36th Streets was removed, while the other trackage became parts of the [[Lexington Avenue Line (surface)|Lexington Avenue Line]] and 42nd Street Crosstown Line.\n\nBuses were substituted for streetcars<!--by whom?--> in September 1919. Service was suspended, but brought back in March 1929 by the Hamilton Bus Company. The Triangle Bus Corporation took over in 1935, and the New York City Omnibus Corporation acquired the route in 1940. That company changed its name to [[Fifth Avenue Coach Lines]] in 1956; the [[Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority]] took over operations in 1962.\n\nIn 2010, because of service cuts, the M21 was rerouted from Avenue C to the FDR drive, becoming a river-to-river crosstown line along Houston St. To replace the M21 on Avenue C, the M9, which ran to 14th Street-Union Square via Avenue B and 14th St north of Houston St, was rerouted to Avenue C up to 23rd Street only.

It traveled across the island between the [[Christopher Street Ferry]] on the [[Hudson River]] and the [[East Tenth Street Ferry]] on the [[East River]]. Tracks were built east from the Christopher Street Ferry dock to [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], where it crossed the [[West Belt Line]]. Eastbound trains continued east on Christopher Street, while the westbound track curved north in West Street<!--later used Washington Street--> after crossing the West Belt Line and turned east on Tenth Street. The [[one-way pair]] continued to [[Greenwich Avenue (Manhattan)|Greenwich Avenue]], through which the [[Seventh Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|Seventh Avenue Line]] ran; cars turned southeast on Greenwich Avenue and east on Eighth Street along the Seventh Avenue Line tracks.

There the westbound track split to the northeast on [[Astor Place (Manhattan)|Astor Place]]/[[Stuyvesant Street (Manhattan)|Stuyvesant Street]] to reach Ninth Street, and the tracks were separated in Eighth and Ninth Streets to [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]]. Trains turned north in Avenue A for two blocks (eastbound) or one block (westbound), along [[Forty-Second Street and Grand Street Ferry Railroad]] trackage, to Tenth Street, and then turned east again for the rest of the line to the East River. The trackage in Tenth Street east of [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]] had been built by the [[Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]].\n\nOn May 28, 1890, the [[Central Crosstown Railroad]], which owned the [[17th and 18th Streets Crosstown Line]] from the [[Christopher Street Ferry]] east-northeast to the [[East 23rd Street Ferry]], leased the Christopher and Tenth Street Railroad. The growing [[Metropolitan Street Railway]] acquired a majority of stock of the Central Crosstown in May 1897, and leased the companies on April 1, 1904. Two months after the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] opened, on February 16, 1904, a second service pattern was added, taking some trains south on Avenue A and the [[one-way pair]] of [[Essex Street (Manhattan)|Essex Street]] and [[Clinton Street (Manhattan)|Clinton Street]] (the latter via [[1st Street (Manhattan)|1st Street]]) to reach [[Delancey Street (Manhattan)|Delancey Street]] and the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], ending at a loop on the [[Brooklyn]] side. Due to the Metropolitan's bankruptcy, their lines over the bridge were replaced in 1911 by a single one, the [[Seventh Avenue-Brooklyn Line]], which shared trackage with the [[Seventh Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|Seventh Avenue Line]] from [[Central Park, Manhattan|Central Park]] to Greenwich Village, turning east on the Eighth Street Crosstown Line and over the bridge to Brooklyn. That service was discontinued in 1919.<!--or maybe just cut back to the Manhattan side?-->\n\nBuses were substituted for streetcars by the [[New York City Omnibus Corporation]] on March 3, 1936. That company changed its name to [[Fifth Avenue Coach Lines]] in 1956; the [[Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority]] took over operations in 1962.\n\n===Budget cuts===\nBecause of economic troubles facing the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] in 2008\u20132009, the M8 bus was proposed for elimination. However, after community protests, the proposal was withdrawn in May 2009. But in June 2010, further budget cuts took away weekend and overnight service on this line.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kramer |title=M8 Bus Riders Say \"Hallelujah!\" |url=http://blogs.wnyc.org/news/2009/05/06/m8-bus-riders-say-hallelujah/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110723193705/http://blogs.wnyc.org/news/2009/05/06/m8-bus-riders-say-hallelujah/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |publisher=WNYC |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2009 }}</ref> Weekend service was reinstated on April 6, 2014, as part of the MTA's 2013-14 Service Enhancements Program.<ref>[http://evgrieve.com/2014/03/m8-weekend-service-resumes-next-sunday.html M8 weekend service resumes next Saturday]</ref><ref>[http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/ServChanges_m8.htm M8 weekend service restored]</ref>\n\n==References==\n*Village Crosstown Trolley Coalition, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070706091816/http://www.villagetrolley.org/newsltr/news0104.htm Making Tracks through the Village, Fall 1995]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Manhattan bus routes|state=expanded}}\n{{NYC streetcar transit}}\n\n\n[[Category:Streetcar lines in Manhattan|Crosstown 008]]\n[[Category:MTA Regional Bus routes|M008]]\n[[Category:1873 introductions]]\n[[Category:Bus routes in Manhattan|008]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Bus route in Manhattan, New York}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2018}}\n{{Infobox bus line\n|box_width     = 300px\n|number        = {{NYC bus infobox header |title=m8}}\n|logo          = <!-- bus logo (ex: Image_name.png) -->\n|logo_width    = <!-- width of bus logo -->\n|logo_alt      = <!-- logo image alternate text (only works if logo_width is supplied) -->\n|subheader     = Eighth and Ninth Streets Crosstown\n|image         = \n|image_width   = 300px\n|image_alt     = <!-- This image cannot be displayed. -->\n|caption       = \n|system        = [[MTA New York City Bus]]\n|operator      = [[New York City Transit Authority]]\n|garage        = [[Michael J.

Two months after the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] opened, on February 16, 1904, a second service pattern was added, taking some trains south on Avenue A and the [[one-way pair]] of [[Essex Street (Manhattan)|Essex Street]] and [[Clinton Street (Manhattan)|Clinton Street]] (the latter via [[1st Street (Manhattan)|1st Street]]) to reach [[Delancey Street (Manhattan)|Delancey Street]] and the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], ending at a loop on the [[Brooklyn]] side. Due to the Metropolitan's bankruptcy, their lines over the bridge were replaced in 1911 by a single one, the [[Seventh Avenue-Brooklyn Line]], which shared trackage with the [[Seventh Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|Seventh Avenue Line]] from [[Central Park, Manhattan|Central Park]] to Greenwich Village, turning east on the Eighth Street Crosstown Line and over the bridge to Brooklyn. That service was discontinued in 1919.<!--or maybe just cut back to the Manhattan side?-->\n\nBuses were substituted for streetcars by the [[New York City Omnibus Corporation]] on March 3, 1936. That company changed its name to [[Fifth Avenue Coach Lines]] in 1956; the [[Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority]] took over operations in 1962.\n\n===Budget cuts===\nBecause of economic troubles facing the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] in 2008\u20132009, the M8 bus was proposed for elimination. However, after community protests, the proposal was withdrawn in May 2009. But in June 2010, further budget cuts took away weekend and overnight service on this line.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kramer |title=M8 Bus Riders Say \"Hallelujah!\" |url=http://blogs.wnyc.org/news/2009/05/06/m8-bus-riders-say-hallelujah/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110723193705/http://blogs.wnyc.org/news/2009/05/06/m8-bus-riders-say-hallelujah/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |publisher=WNYC |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2009 }}</ref> Weekend service was reinstated on April 6, 2014, as part of the MTA's 2013-14 Service Enhancements Program.<ref>[http://evgrieve.com/2014/03/m8-weekend-service-resumes-next-sunday.html M8 weekend service resumes next Saturday]</ref><ref>[http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/ServChanges_m8.htm M8 weekend service restored]</ref>\n\n==References==\n*Village Crosstown Trolley Coalition, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070706091816/http://www.villagetrolley.org/newsltr/news0104.htm Making Tracks through the Village, Fall 1995]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Manhattan bus routes|state=expanded}}\n{{NYC streetcar transit}}\n\n\n[[Category:Streetcar lines in Manhattan|Crosstown 008]]\n[[Category:MTA Regional Bus routes|M008]]\n[[Category:1873 introductions]]\n[[Category:Bus routes in Manhattan|008]]\n", "name_user": "Epicgenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove unnecessary specification that NYC is in the US", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M8_(New_York_City_bus)"}

Ah\u00e1\u014bha\u014b Oy\u00e1\u014bke}}), also called '''Pine Ridge Agency''', is an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Indian reservation]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Dakota]]. Originally included within the territory of the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], Pine Ridge was created by the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. in the southwest corner of South Dakota on the Nebraska border. Today it consists of {{convert|3,468.85|mi2|km2|abbr=on}} of land area and is one of the largest reservations in the United States, larger than [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]] combined.<ref>https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/biggest-indian-reservations-in-the-united-states.html</ref>\n\nThe reservation encompasses the entirety of [[Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota|Oglala Lakota County]] and [[Bennett County, South Dakota|Bennett County]], the southern half of [[Jackson County, South Dakota|Jackson County]], and a small section of [[Sheridan County, Nebraska|Sheridan County]] added by Executive Order No. 2980 of February 20, 1904. Of the 3,142 counties in the United States, these are among [[Lowest-income counties in the United States|the poorest]]. Only {{convert|84000|acre|km2}} of land are suitable for agriculture. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] population of the reservation was 15,521; but a study conducted by [[Colorado State University]] and accepted by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] has estimated the resident population to reach 28,787.<ref>[http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/ih/codetalk/onap/ihbgformula.cfm#2 \"Indian Housing Block Grant Formula\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414141829/http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/ih/codetalk/onap/ihbgformula.cfm |date=2009-04-14 }}, U.S. Housing and Urban Development</ref>\n\nPine Ridge is the site of several events that mark milestones in the history between the [[Sioux]] of the area and the [[United States]] (U.S.) government. Stronghold Table\u2014a [[mesa]] in what is today the Oglala-administered portion of [[Badlands National Park]]\u2014was the location of the last of the [[Ghost Dance]]s. The U.S. authorities' attempt to repress this movement eventually led to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] on December 29, 1890. A mixed band of [[Miniconjou]] Lakota and [[Hunkpapa]] Sioux, led by [[Spotted Elk|Chief Spotted Elk]], sought sanctuary at Pine Ridge after fleeing the [[Standing Rock Agency]], where [[Sitting Bull]] had been killed during efforts to arrest him. The families were intercepted by a heavily armed detachment of the Seventh Cavalry, which attacked them, killing many women and children as well as warriors. This was the last large engagement between U.S. forces and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and marked the end of the western frontier.\n\nChanges accumulated in the last quarter of the 20th century; in 1971 the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) started [[Oglala Lakota College]], a [[Tribal colleges and universities|tribal college]], which offers 4-year degrees. In 1973 decades of discontent at the Pine Ridge Reservation resulted in a grassroots protest that escalated into the [[Wounded Knee Incident]], gaining national attention. Members of the Oglala Lakota, the [[American Indian Movement]] and supporters occupied the town in defiance of federal and state law enforcement in a protest that turned into an armed standoff lasting 71 days. This event inspired American Indians across the country and gradually led to changes at the reservation, with a revival of some cultural traditions. In 1981 the Lakota [[Tim Giago]] started the ''[[Lakota Times]]'' at Pine Ridge; he published it until selling it in 1998.\n\nLocated at the southern end of the [[Badlands]], the reservation is part of the [[mixed grass prairie]], an ecological transition zone between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies; all are part of the [[Great Plains]]. A great variety of plant and animal life flourishes on and adjacent to the reservation, including the endangered [[black-footed ferret]]. The area is also important in the field of [[paleontology]]; it contains deposits of [[Pierre Shale]] formed on the seafloor of the [[Western Interior Seaway]], evidence of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary|marine Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], and one of the largest deposits of fossils of extinct mammals from the [[Oligocene|Oligocene epoch]].\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Great Sioux Reservation====\n[[File:Great Sioux reservation in 1888.png|thumb|[[Great Sioux Reservation]], 1888; established by [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]]]]\n[[File:Siouxreservationmap.png|thumb|Map showing the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], subsequent loss of land to the federal government, and current holdings of the various Sioux reservations]]\n\nAs stipulated in the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1868)]], the U.S. government built Indian agencies for the various Lakota and other Plains tribes. These were forerunners to the modern Indian reservations. The [[Red Cloud Agency]] was established for the Oglala Lakota in 1871 on the [[North Platte River]] in [[Wyoming Territory]]. The location was one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of the present town of [[Henry, Nebraska]]. The location of the Red Cloud Agency was moved to two other locations before being settled at the present Pine Ridge location. Pine Ridge Reservation was originally part of the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] established by the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]]; it encompassed approximately 60 million contiguous acres (240,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of western [[South Dakota]] (all of what is now called [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]), northern [[Nebraska]] and eastern [[Wyoming]].\n\n====Theft of the Black Hills====\nIn 1874 [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the U.S. Army [[Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition|Black Hills Expedition]], which set out on July 2 from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[Dakota Territory]], with orders to travel to the previously uncharted [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. Its mission was to look for suitable locations for a fort, find a route to the southwest, and to investigate the potential for gold mining. After the discovery of gold was made public, miners began invading Sioux Territory.\n\n\"Custer's florid descriptions of the mineral and timber resources of the Black Hills, and the land's suitability for grazing and cultivation&nbsp;... received wide circulation, and had the effect of creating an intense popular demand for more settlers to invade the Black Hills.\"<ref>{{ussc|name=United States v. Sioux Nation |volume=448|page=371|pin=377|year=1980}}.</ref> Initially the U.S. military tried to turn away trespassing miners and settlers. Eventually President Grant, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], and the [[Secretary of War]], \"decided that the military should make no further resistance to the occupation of the Black Hills by miners.\"<ref name=ReferenceA>''U.S. v. Sioux Nation'', 448 U.S. at 378.</ref> These orders were to be enforced \"quietly\", and the President's decision was to remain \"confidential.\"<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\n[[File:Indian Land for Sale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1911 ad offering former reservation land for sale. Most of the \"[[Dawes Act|allotted Indian land]]\" sold the previous year (1910) was Sioux land.]]\n\nAs more settlers and gold miners encroached upon the Black Hills, the Government determined it had to acquire the land from the Sioux, and appointed a commission to negotiate the purchase.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''U.S. v. Sioux Nation'', 448 U.S. at 379.</ref> The negotiations failed, as the Sioux resisted giving up what they considered sacred land. The U.S. resorted to military force. They declared the Sioux Indians \"hostile\" for failing to obey an order to return from an off-reservation hunting expedition by a specific date. In the dead of winter, the Sioux found the overland travel was impossible.<ref>''U.S. v. Sioux Nation'', 448 U.S. at 379-380.</ref>\n\nThe consequent military expedition to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills included an attack on a major encampment of several bands on the Little Bighorn River. Led by General Custer, the attack ended in his defeat; it was an overwhelming victory of chiefs [[Sitting Bull]] and [[Crazy Horse]] over the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]], a conflict often called [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Custer's Last Stand.]]<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>See generally {{cite book |last=Philbrick |first=Nathaniel |title=The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn |year=2010 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-02172-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670021727 }}</ref> US forces were vastly outnumbered.\n\nIn 1876 the U.S. Congress decided to open up the Black Hills to development and break up the Great Sioux Reservation. In 1877, it passed an act to make 7.7 million acres (31,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the [[Black Hills]] available for sale to [[Homestead Act|homesteaders]] and private interests. In 1889 Congress divided the remaining area of Great Sioux Reservation into five separate reservations, defining the boundaries of each in its Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. Pine Ridge was established at that time.\n\n====Wounded Knee Massacre====\n{{Main|Wounded Knee Massacre}}\n[[File:Grabill - Survivors of Big Foots band.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Survivors of [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], 1891 (Title: ''What's left of Big Foot's band'').

The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, led by Colonel [[James W.

One version of events claims that during the process, a deaf tribesman named [[Black Coyote]] was reluctant to give up his rifle, saying he had paid a lot for it.<ref>[http://www.lastoftheindependents.com/wounded.htm \"Wounded Knee&nbsp;\u2014 Lakota\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106003804/http://www.lastoftheindependents.com/wounded.htm |date=2010-01-06 }}, Native American Atrocities</ref> A scuffle over Black Coyote's rifle escalated and a shot was fired, which resulted in the 7th Cavalry opening firing indiscriminately from all sides, killing men, women, and children, as well as some of their fellow troopers. Those few Lakota warriors who still had weapons began shooting back at the troopers, who quickly suppressed the Lakota fire. The surviving Lakota fled, but U.S. cavalrymen pursued and killed many who were unarmed.\n\nIn the end, U.S. forces killed at least 150 men, women, and children of the Lakota Sioux and wounded 51 (four men, and 47 women and children, some of whom died later); some estimates placed the number of dead at 300. Twenty-five troopers also died, and thirty-nine were wounded (six of the wounded would also die).<ref>Jack Utter, ''Wounded Knee & the Ghost Dance Tragedy,'' p. 25, National Woodlands Publishing Company; 1st edition (April 1991) {{ISBN|0-9628075-1-6}}</ref> Many Army deaths were believed to have been caused by [[friendly fire]], as the shooting took place at close range in chaotic conditions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strom |first=Karen |title=The Massacre at Wounded Knee |publisher=Karen Strom |year=1995 |url=http://www.hanksville.org/daniel/lakota/Wounded_Knee.html |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe site has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is administered by the National Park Service.<ref name=nps/>{{clear}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====White Clay Extension====\n[[File:Whiteclay Nebraska Taverm 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Tavern in [[Whiteclay, Nebraska]] (1940)]]\n{{main|Whiteclay, Nebraska}}\nIn 1882, at the urging of [[Valentine McGillycuddy]]&nbsp;\u2014 the US [[Indian Agent]] at the Pine President Agency&nbsp;\u2014 President [[Chester A.

The ban was ended in 1953 by Public Law 277, signed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The amended law gave Native American tribes the option of permitting or banning alcohol sales and consumption on their lands.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBDF5_L3BgC&pg=PA230&dq=Alcohol+native+americans+dwight+eisenhower&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pKk9T5n8KPGO0QGsqe2wBw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Alcohol%20native%20americans%20dwight%20eisenhower&f=false James Stuart Olson: ''Historical dictionary of the 1950s'']</ref> The OST and many other tribes chose to exclude alcohol from their reservations because of the problems for their people.\n\nIn 1887, when Congress enacted the [[Dawes Act|Dawes Severalty Act of 1887]]&nbsp;\u2014 breaking up the reservations and allotting a {{convert|160|acre|ha}} plot to the registered head of each family&nbsp;\u2014 the Whiteclay Extension was specifically exempted. On March 2, 1889 the U.S. Congress enacted the ''Great Sioux Agreement of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888,'' breaking up the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] and setting boundaries for the six reduced reservations. In this act, the White Clay Extension was incorporated again within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Agency. \"Provided, That the said tract of land in the State of Nebraska shall be reserved, by Executive order, only so long as it may be needed for the use and protection of the Indians receiving rations and annuities at the Pine Ridge Agency.\"<ref>''INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES'' Vol. I, Laws; Chapter 405, March 2, 1889. | 25 Stat., 888.[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol1/HTML_files/SES0328.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103204458/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0328.html |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1904, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed an executive order returning the {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} of the White Clay Extension to the public domain.

Roosevelt]]'s administration made changes in federal policy to improve conditions for American Indians. In response to complaints about corruption and injustices in the BIA management of reservations, Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, permitting tribal nations to reorganize with self-government. It encouraged them to adopt a model of elected representative governments and elected tribal chairmen or presidents, with written constitutions. While tribes welcomed taking back more control of their government, this change eroded the power and structure of the traditional hereditary leaders of the [[clan]] system.\n\nThe Oglala Sioux Tribe developed a tribal government along democratic constitutional lines, with a chairman to be elected for a two-year term. This short term makes it difficult for leaders to accomplish longer-term projects, but the tribe has not changed its constitution. The BIA still has had the ability to oversee some tribal operations, including the police. Historically BIA tribal police were often assigned from other Indian tribes rather than representing local people and understanding their culture, which created tensions. Many traditionalists among the Oglala Lakota never supported the new style of government; tribal elders were still respected, and there were multiple lines of authority and influence among different groups on the reservation. Political factions also formed between those who were [[mixed race|mixed-bloods]] or had urban experiences, and those who were full-bloods and tended to be more traditional in practices and culture.<ref name=akim>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+%28OSCRO%29&source=bl&ots=rzJJ9pya80&sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&hl=en&ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20%28OSCRO%29&f=false ''Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee''], Texas Tech University Press, 2007</ref>\n\nThe people continued to be under assimilation pressure: through the early part of the century, many children were sent away to Indian boarding schools where they were usually required to speak English and were prohibited from speaking Lakota; they were usually expected to practice Christianity rather than native religions.

Longstanding divisions on the reservation resulted from deep-seated political, ethnic and cultural differences. Many residents did not support the elected tribal government. Many residents were upset about what they described as the autocratic and repressive actions by the tribal president [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Dick Wilson]], elected in 1972.\n\nOn Feb. 21, the tribal council was called into session to consider impeaching Wilson. Five hundred Oglala members were in attendance. He was criticized for favoring family and friends with jobs and benefits, not consulting with the tribal council, and creating a private [[militia]], known as the [[Guardians of the Oglala Nation]] (GOONs), to suppress political opponents. He used tribal funds to pay for this force. Wilson's response was to screen a right wing propaganda film.   After a series of meetings held in the Calico community near the Pine Ridge Agency, the old traditional chiefs and the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) called down to AIM in Rapid City and asked them to come to Pine Ridge. A meeting was arranged between Wilson and Russell Means.   Five of Wilson's supporters cornered Means in the parking lot. Means escaped.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Road to Wounded Knee|last=Koster|first=John|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=224\u2013225|quote=|via=}}</ref> Women elders such as Ellen Moves Camp, founder of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), called for action.

They demanded the removal of Wilson, restoration of treaty negotiations with the U.S. government, and correction of U.S. failures to enforce treaty rights. Visits by the U.S. senators from South Dakota, FBI agents and [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) representatives, were attended by widespread media coverage, but the [[Richard Nixon]] administration was preoccupied internally with [[Watergate]].<ref name=PBS/>\n\nAs the events evolved, the activists at Wounded Knee had a 71-day armed stand-off with U.S. law enforcement.

Missing since December 1975, she had been shot execution-style. At the time, some AIM people said that she was a government informant, but the FBI has denied that. In 1974 AIM had discovered that Douglas Durham, then head of security, was an FBI informant. Three federal grand juries were called to hear testimony on the Aquash murder: in 1976, 1982 and 1994, but it was more than a quarter of a century before any suspects were indicted and tried for the crime. Two AIM members, [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] and [[John Graham]], were convicted of her murder in 2004 and 2010 respectively, and sentenced to life in prison. Bruce Ellison, Leonard Peltier's lawyer since the 1970s, invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights and refused to testify at the grand jury hearings on Looking Cloud or at his trial in 2004.

Since 1999, activists from the Pine Ridge Reservation, AIM, and [[Nebraskans for Peace]] have worked to have beer sales shut down in nearby [[Whiteclay, Nebraska]], a border town. Whiteclay sells millions of cans of beer annually, primarily to residents from the reservation in South Dakota, where alcohol possession and consumption is prohibited. In 2008 the documentary ''[[The Battle for Whiteclay]],'' about the toll of alcoholism and activists' efforts to control beer sales, was released, which has attracted wide attention. The Nebraska legislature allocated funds in late 2010 for increased police patrols in Pine Ridge by the county sheriff's office, based {{convert|22|mi|km}} away in [[Rushville, Nebraska|Rushville]].\n\nWhile other tribes and reservations also prohibited alcohol at one time, many have since legalized its sales on their reservations. They use the revenues generated to improve health care and life on the reservation, and they prefer to directly control the regulation of alcohol sales and police its use. A 2007 survey found that 63% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states have legalized liquor sales on their reservations.<ref name=Hughes/> They include the nearby [[Sicangu Oyate]] or Brul\u00e9 Sioux at the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], also located in South Dakota. In 2006, the [[Omaha Nation]] in northeastern Nebraska started requiring payment of tribal license fees and sales taxes by liquor stores located in towns within its reservation boundaries in order to benefit in the revenues generated by alcohol sales.<ref name=Liquor>[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=H-AMINDIAN&month=0612&week=e&msg=3LoJIeU4HMsQCpZhNejOUQ&user=&pw= Paul Hammel, \"Tribe's Liquor Tax May Restart Old Boundary Dispute,\"], ''Omaha World-Herald'' (Nebraska), 28 December 2006, p. 03B, at H-Amindian Discussion Log, accessed 27 February 2012</ref>\n\nActivists at Pine Ridge have worked to persuade Nebraska to enforce its own laws and support the tribe's prohibition.

Charles Cummings was elected as county sheriff, Gerald 'Jed' Bettelyoun to one of the positions as county commissioner, and Sandy Flye became the first Native American elected to a seat on the county school board.

No banks or discount stores are located on the reservation.<ref name=Resroad/> But, its people receive $80 million annually in federal monies, such as Social Security and veterans benefits; they spend most of this money largely in stores located off the reservation in Nebraska border towns, creating no benefit for the tribe. As the journalist Stephanie Woodward noted, little money changes hands within the reservation.<ref name=Woodward/> As an example of the money that goes outside the reservation to border towns, the owner of Whiteclay's grocery store, Arrowhead Foods, said he \"did more than a million dollars in business last year, with an entirely Native American clientele.\"<ref name=Woodward>[http://100r.org/2012/02/gold-mines-in-hell/ Stephanie Woodward, \"Gold Mines in Hell\"], 100Reporters, February 2012</ref> Similarly, Nebraska State Senator [[LeRoy J. Louden]], whose district includes Whiteclay, noted the recent construction of a [[Walmart]] superstore at [[Chadron, Nebraska]], another border town. He said, \"That store was built because of the reservation.\"<ref name=Woodward/>\n\nThe tribe has prohibited sale and consumption of alcohol on the reservation, but Pine Ridge residents support four liquor stores at Whiteclay, which in 2010 paid federal and state excise taxes (included in liquor's sale price) of $413,932, according to the state liquor commission.<ref name=Woodward/> Some residents have argued that the continuing rate of alcoholism on the reservation shows the failure of the prohibition policy. They say that if the tribe legalized alcohol sales, it could keep much of the revenues now flowing to Nebraska and to state and federal taxes, and use such monies to bolster the reservation's economy and health care services, including building a much-needed detoxification facility and rehab services.\n\nDespite the lack of formal employment opportunities on Pine Ridge, considerable agricultural production is taking place on the reservation. Only a small percentage of the tribe directly benefits from this, as land is leased to agricultural producers. According to the [[USDA]], in 2002 there was nearly $33 million in receipts from agricultural production on Pine Ridge. Less than one-third of that income went to members of the tribe.<ref>[http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/amindian.pdf USDA 2002 \"Census of Agriculture for Native American Reservations\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615033245/http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/amindian.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nMost employment on the reservation is provided by community institutions, such as the tribal Oglala Lakota College, and other schools; the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA); and the U.S. [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS). In October 2016 the tribe opened an 80-bed nursing home; at full operation it will employ 100 staff. The tribe is working on a justice center and has advertised an art competition for works for its spaces, to include the tribal courts and a [[restorative justice]] courtroom.\n\nEnterprises owned by the Oglala Sioux tribe include the Prairie Wind Casino, a Parks and Recreation Department, guided hunting, and cattle ranching and farming.<ref name=OSTCommunityProfile>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnisose.org/profiles/oglala.htm|title=Oglala Sioux Tribe Community Environmental Profile|author=staff|year=1997|work=Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition, Inc.|accessdate=2007-10-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018231642/http://www.mnisose.org/profiles/oglala.htm|archivedate=2007-10-18}}</ref> The Oglala Sioux Tribe also operates the White River Visitor Center near the [[Badlands National Park]].<ref name=NPSBadlands>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/badl/planyourvisit/hours.htm|title=Badlands National Park Operating Hours & Seasons|author=staff|work=U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> It has one radio station, [[KILI|KILI-FM]] in [[Porcupine, South Dakota|Porcupine]].\n\nIn 1973 at the time of the Wounded Knee Incident, not one Native American worked for a South Dakota newspaper.

Grasses dominate the landscape.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/badl/naturescience/prairies.htm \"Badlands: Prairies\"], National Park Service</ref>\nThe short-grass and tall-grass prairies intergrade just east of an irregular line that runs from northern Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, northwestward into west-central North Dakota and South Dakota. The perimeter is not well defined because of the array of short-stature, intermediate, and tall-grass species that make up an [[ecotone]] between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies (Bragg and Steuter 1996). In general, the mixed-grass prairie is characterized by the warm-season grasses of the short-grass prairie to the west and the cool- and warm-season grasses, which grow much taller, to the east. Because of this ecotonal mixing, the number of plant species found in mixed-grass prairies exceeds that in other prairie types.<ref>[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/habitat/grlands/grasses.htm \"Habitat: Grasslands\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614024851/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/habitat/grlands/grasses.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}, United States Geological Service</ref> Since 2000, [[hemp]] has grown wild here, following a failed attempt in growing it commercially, as a local ordinance allows.

Ah\u00e1\u014bha\u014b Oy\u00e1\u014bke}}), also called '''Pine Ridge Agency''', is an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Indian reservation]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Dakota]]. Originally included within the territory of the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], Pine Ridge was created by the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. in the southwest corner of South Dakota on the Nebraska border. Today it consists of {{convert|3,468.85|mi2|km2|abbr=on}} of land area and is one of the largest reservations in the United States, larger than [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]] combined.<ref>https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/biggest-indian-reservations-in-the-united-states.html</ref>\n\nThe reservation encompasses the entirety of [[Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota|Oglala Lakota County]] and [[Bennett County, South Dakota|Bennett County]], the southern half of [[Jackson County, South Dakota|Jackson County]], and a small section of [[Sheridan County, Nebraska|Sheridan County]] added by Executive Order No. 2980 of February 20, 1904. Of the 3,142 counties in the United States, these are among [[Lowest-income counties in the United States|the poorest]]. Only {{convert|84000|acre|km2}} of land are suitable for agriculture. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] population of the reservation was 15,521; but a study conducted by [[Colorado State University]] and accepted by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] has estimated the resident population to reach 28,787.<ref>[http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/ih/codetalk/onap/ihbgformula.cfm#2 \"Indian Housing Block Grant Formula\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414141829/http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/ih/codetalk/onap/ihbgformula.cfm |date=2009-04-14 }}, U.S. Housing and Urban Development</ref>\n\nPine Ridge is the site of several events that mark milestones in the history between the [[Sioux]] of the area and the [[United States]] (U.S.) government. Stronghold Table\u2014a [[mesa]] in what is today the Oglala-administered portion of [[Badlands National Park]]\u2014was the location of the last of the [[Ghost Dance]]s. The U.S. authorities' attempt to repress this movement eventually led to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] on December 29, 1890. A mixed band of [[Miniconjou]] Lakota and [[Hunkpapa]] Sioux, led by [[Spotted Elk|Chief Spotted Elk]], sought sanctuary at Pine Ridge after fleeing the [[Standing Rock Agency]], where [[Sitting Bull]] had been killed during efforts to arrest him. The families were intercepted by a heavily armed detachment of the Seventh Cavalry, which attacked them, killing many women and children as well as warriors. This was the last large engagement between U.S. forces and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and marked the end of the western frontier.\n\nChanges accumulated in the last quarter of the 20th century; in 1971 the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) started [[Oglala Lakota College]], a [[Tribal colleges and universities|tribal college]], which offers 4-year degrees. In 1973 decades of discontent at the Pine Ridge Reservation resulted in a grassroots protest that escalated into the [[Wounded Knee Incident]], gaining national attention. Members of the Oglala Lakota, the [[American Indian Movement]] and supporters occupied the town in defiance of federal and state law enforcement in a protest that turned into an armed standoff lasting 71 days. This event inspired American Indians across the country and gradually led to changes at the reservation, with a revival of some cultural traditions. In 1981 the Lakota [[Tim Giago]] started the ''[[Lakota Times]]'' at Pine Ridge; he published it until selling it in 1998.\n\nLocated at the southern end of the [[Badlands]], the reservation is part of the [[mixed grass prairie]], an ecological transition zone between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies; all are part of the [[Great Plains]]. A great variety of plant and animal life flourishes on and adjacent to the reservation, including the endangered [[black-footed ferret]]. The area is also important in the field of [[paleontology]]; it contains deposits of [[Pierre Shale]] formed on the seafloor of the [[Western Interior Seaway]], evidence of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary|marine Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], and one of the largest deposits of fossils of extinct mammals from the [[Oligocene|Oligocene epoch]].\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Great Sioux Reservation====\n[[File:Great Sioux reservation in 1888.png|thumb|[[Great Sioux Reservation]], 1888; established by [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]]]]\n[[File:Siouxreservationmap.png|thumb|Map showing the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], subsequent loss of land to the federal government, and current holdings of the various Sioux reservations]]\n\nAs stipulated in the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1868)]], the U.S. government built Indian agencies for the various Lakota and other Plains tribes. These were forerunners to the modern Indian reservations. The [[Red Cloud Agency]] was established for the Oglala Lakota in 1871 on the [[North Platte River]] in [[Wyoming Territory]]. The location was one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of the present town of [[Henry, Nebraska]]. The location of the Red Cloud Agency was moved to two other locations before being settled at the present Pine Ridge location. Pine Ridge Reservation was originally part of the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] established by the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]]; it encompassed approximately 60 million contiguous acres (240,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of western [[South Dakota]] (all of what is now called [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]), northern [[Nebraska]] and eastern [[Wyoming]].\n\n====Theft of the Black Hills====\nIn 1874 [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the U.S. Army [[Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition|Black Hills Expedition]], which set out on July 2 from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[Dakota Territory]], with orders to travel to the previously uncharted [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. Its mission was to look for suitable locations for a fort, find a route to the southwest, and to investigate the potential for gold mining. After the discovery of gold was made public, miners began invading Sioux Territory. \n\n\"Custer's florid descriptions of the mineral and timber resources of the Black Hills, and the land's suitability for grazing and cultivation&nbsp;... received wide circulation, and had the effect of creating an intense popular demand for more settlers to invade the Black Hills.\"<ref>{{ussc|name=United States v.

Sioux Nation'', 448 U.S. at 379-380.</ref>\n\nThe consequent military expedition to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills included an attack on a major encampment of several bands on the Little Bighorn River. Led by General Custer, the attack ended in his defeat; it was an overwhelming victory of chiefs [[Sitting Bull]] and [[Crazy Horse]] over the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]], a conflict often called [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Custer's Last Stand.]]<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>See generally {{cite book |last=Philbrick |first=Nathaniel |title=The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn |year=2010 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-02172-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670021727 }}</ref> US forces were vastly outnumbered.\n\nIn 1876 the U.S. Congress decided to open up the Black Hills to development and break up the Great Sioux Reservation. In 1877, it passed an act to make 7.7 million acres (31,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the [[Black Hills]] available for sale to [[Homestead Act|homesteaders]] and private interests. In 1889 Congress divided the remaining area of Great Sioux Reservation into five separate reservations, defining the boundaries of each in its Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. Pine Ridge was established at that time.\n\n====Wounded Knee Massacre====\n{{Main|Wounded Knee Massacre}}\n[[File:Grabill - Survivors of Big Foots band.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Survivors of [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], 1891 (Title: ''What's left of Big Foot's band'').

One version of events claims that during the process, a deaf tribesman named [[Black Coyote]] was reluctant to give up his rifle, saying he had paid a lot for it.<ref>[http://www.lastoftheindependents.com/wounded.htm \"Wounded Knee&nbsp;\u2014 Lakota\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106003804/http://www.lastoftheindependents.com/wounded.htm |date=2010-01-06 }}, Native American Atrocities</ref> A scuffle over Black Coyote's rifle escalated and a shot was fired, which resulted in the 7th Cavalry opening firing indiscriminately from all sides, killing men, women, and children, as well as some of their fellow troopers. Those few Lakota warriors who still had weapons began shooting back at the troopers, who quickly suppressed the Lakota fire. The surviving Lakota fled, but U.S. cavalrymen pursued and killed many who were unarmed.\n\nIn the end, U.S. forces killed at least 150 men, women, and children of the Lakota Sioux and wounded 51 (four men, and 47 women and children, some of whom died later); some estimates placed the number of dead at 300. Twenty-five troopers also died, and thirty-nine were wounded (six of the wounded would also die).<ref>Jack Utter, ''Wounded Knee & the Ghost Dance Tragedy,'' p. 25, National Woodlands Publishing Company; 1st edition (April 1991) {{ISBN|0-9628075-1-6}}</ref> Many Army deaths were believed to have been caused by [[friendly fire]], as the shooting took place at close range in chaotic conditions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strom |first=Karen |title=The Massacre at Wounded Knee |publisher=Karen Strom |year=1995 |url=http://www.hanksville.org/daniel/lakota/Wounded_Knee.html |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe site has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is administered by the National Park Service.<ref name=nps/>{{clear}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====White Clay Extension====\n[[File:Whiteclay Nebraska Taverm 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Tavern in [[Whiteclay, Nebraska]] (1940)]]\n{{main|Whiteclay, Nebraska}}\nIn 1882, at the urging of [[Valentine McGillycuddy]]&nbsp;\u2014 the US [[Indian Agent]] at the Pine President Agency&nbsp;\u2014 President [[Chester A.

Roosevelt]]'s administration made changes in federal policy to improve conditions for American Indians. In response to complaints about corruption and injustices in the BIA management of reservations, Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, permitting tribal nations to reorganize with self-government. It encouraged them to adopt a model of elected representative governments and elected tribal chairmen or presidents, with written constitutions. While tribes welcomed taking back more control of their government, this change eroded the power and structure of the traditional hereditary leaders of the [[clan]] system.\n\nThe Oglala Sioux Tribe developed a tribal government along democratic constitutional lines, with a chairman to be elected for a two-year term. This short term makes it difficult for leaders to accomplish longer-term projects, but the tribe has not changed its constitution. The BIA still has had the ability to oversee some tribal operations, including the police. Historically BIA tribal police were often assigned from other Indian tribes rather than representing local people and understanding their culture, which created tensions. Many traditionalists among the Oglala Lakota never supported the new style of government; tribal elders were still respected, and there were multiple lines of authority and influence among different groups on the reservation. Political factions also formed between those who were [[mixed race|mixed-bloods]] or had urban experiences, and those who were full-bloods and tended to be more traditional in practices and culture.<ref name=akim>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+%28OSCRO%29&source=bl&ots=rzJJ9pya80&sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&hl=en&ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20%28OSCRO%29&f=false ''Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee''], Texas Tech University Press, 2007</ref>\n\nThe people continued to be under assimilation pressure: through the early part of the century, many children were sent away to Indian boarding schools where they were usually required to speak English and were prohibited from speaking Lakota; they were usually expected to practice Christianity rather than native religions.

Longstanding divisions on the reservation resulted from deep-seated political, ethnic and cultural differences. Many residents did not support the elected tribal government. Many residents were upset about what they described as the autocratic and repressive actions by the tribal president [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Dick Wilson]], elected in 1972.\n\nOn Feb. 21, the tribal council was called into session to consider impeaching Wilson. Five hundred Oglala members were in attendance. He was criticized for favoring family and friends with jobs and benefits, not consulting with the tribal council, and creating a private [[militia]], known as the [[Guardians of the Oglala Nation]] (GOONs), to suppress political opponents. He used tribal funds to pay for this force. Wilson's response was to screen a right wing propaganda film.   After a series of meetings held in the Calico community near the Pine Ridge Agency, the old traditional chiefs and the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) called down to AIM in Rapid City and asked them to come to Pine Ridge. A meeting was arranged between Wilson and Russell Means.   Five of Wilson's supporters cornered Means in the parking lot. Means escaped.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Road to Wounded Knee|last=Koster|first=John|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=224\u2013225|quote=|via=}}</ref> Women elders such as Ellen Moves Camp, founder of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), called for action.

They demanded the removal of Wilson, restoration of treaty negotiations with the U.S. government, and correction of U.S. failures to enforce treaty rights. Visits by the U.S. senators from South Dakota, FBI agents and [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) representatives, were attended by widespread media coverage, but the [[Richard Nixon]] administration was preoccupied internally with [[Watergate]].<ref name=PBS/>\n\nAs the events evolved, the activists at Wounded Knee had a 71-day armed stand-off with U.S. law enforcement.

Missing since December 1975, she had been shot execution-style. At the time, some AIM people said that she was a government informant, but the FBI has denied that. In 1974 AIM had discovered that Douglas Durham, then head of security, was an FBI informant. Three federal grand juries were called to hear testimony on the Aquash murder: in 1976, 1982 and 1994, but it was more than a quarter of a century before any suspects were indicted and tried for the crime. Two AIM members, [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] and [[John Graham]], were convicted of her murder in 2004 and 2010 respectively, and sentenced to life in prison. Bruce Ellison, Leonard Peltier's lawyer since the 1970s, invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights and refused to testify at the grand jury hearings on Looking Cloud or at his trial in 2004. At trial, the federal prosecutor referred to Ellison as a co-conspirator in the Aquash case.<ref>[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf \"Looking Cloud appeal decision\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308125102/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf |date=2012-03-08 }}, Eighth Circuit Court</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190109204835/https://www.arthashastr.com/2019/01/quota-for-general-category-poor.html Nomaan Merchant, \"SD jury convicts man in 1975 AIM activist's death\"], Associated Press, ''Beaver County Times,'' December 11, 2010</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n{{Further|The Battle for Whiteclay}}\nAlcoholism among residents has been a continuing problem in the life of the reservation since its founding. Since 1999, activists from the Pine Ridge Reservation, AIM, and [[Nebraskans for Peace]] have worked to have beer sales shut down in nearby [[Whiteclay, Nebraska]], a border town. Whiteclay sells millions of cans of beer annually, primarily to residents from the reservation in South Dakota, where alcohol possession and consumption is prohibited. In 2008 the documentary ''[[The Battle for Whiteclay]],'' about the toll of alcoholism and activists' efforts to control beer sales, was released, which has attracted wide attention. The Nebraska legislature allocated funds in late 2010 for increased police patrols in Pine Ridge by the county sheriff's office, based {{convert|22|mi|km}} away in [[Rushville, Nebraska|Rushville]].\n\nWhile other tribes and reservations also prohibited alcohol at one time, many have since legalized its sales on their reservations. They use the revenues generated to improve health care and life on the reservation, and they prefer to directly control the regulation of alcohol sales and police its use. A 2007 survey found that 63% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states have legalized liquor sales on their reservations.<ref name=Hughes/> They include the nearby [[Sicangu Oyate]] or Brul\u00e9 Sioux at the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], also located in South Dakota. In 2006, the [[Omaha Nation]] in northeastern Nebraska started requiring payment of tribal license fees and sales taxes by liquor stores located in towns within its reservation boundaries in order to benefit in the revenues generated by alcohol sales.<ref name=Liquor>[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=H-AMINDIAN&month=0612&week=e&msg=3LoJIeU4HMsQCpZhNejOUQ&user=&pw= Paul Hammel, \"Tribe's Liquor Tax May Restart Old Boundary Dispute,\"], ''Omaha World-Herald'' (Nebraska), 28 December 2006, p. 03B, at H-Amindian Discussion Log, accessed 27 February 2012</ref>\n\nActivists at Pine Ridge have worked to persuade Nebraska to enforce its own laws and support the tribe's prohibition. In 2004 the [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]] voted down a referendum to legalize alcohol sales, and in 2006 the tribal council voted to maintain the ban on alcohol sales, rather than taking on the benefits and responsibility directly.<ref name=Hughes>[http://documents.jdsupra.com/4c1267de-b226-4e76-bd8a-4a2548169500.pdf James N.

It now employs 1,400 people in 26 subsidiaries. With its revenues, the Winnebago have been able to build a hospital, a new school and $1 million in new housing. Kevin Abourezk reported that [[Stew Magnuson]]\u2014the author of ''The Death of [[Raymond Yellow Thunder]]'', a study of issues related to the Pine Ridge reservation and its border towns\u2014described alcohol prohibition at the reservation \"as a complete failure.\"<ref name=Abourezk/> Magnuson said, \"Whenever you have prohibition, you're going to have places like Whiteclay.\"<ref name=Abourezk/> He thought prohibition contributed to bootlegging on the reservation.\n\nOn February 9, 2012 the Oglala Sioux Tribe filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court of Nebraska against the four liquor stores in Whiteclay, Nebraska, as well as the beverage distributors and the brewery companies who make it. The suit, ''Oglala Sioux Tribe v.

In 1878 Congress authorized the formation of an Indian police force to provide law enforcement in [[Indian territory]] and upon reservations. They were superseded by police assigned and managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The BIA police force is composed of members of various Native American tribes from throughout the United States, and personnel often do not belong to the nations they oversee.\n\nSince the late 1970s, the Oglala Sioux Tribe has received Federal funding to maintain its own reservation police, supplemented by BIA personnel.

The latter concept relates to traditional Lakota ideas about restoring the victim and offender to balance within the community. In practice, it is intended to bring together the affected parties in facilitated communication, together with members of the community; to settle on a form of reparation or compensation by the offender that is satisfactory to the victim, which may include money, public apology, and/or community service work; and to bring the offender quickly back within the community with its support for the future.

No banks or discount stores are located on the reservation.<ref name=Resroad/> But, its people receive $80 million annually in federal monies, such as Social Security and veterans benefits; they spend most of this money largely in stores located off the reservation in Nebraska border towns, creating no benefit for the tribe. As the journalist Stephanie Woodward noted, little money changes hands within the reservation.<ref name=Woodward/> As an example of the money that goes outside the reservation to border towns, the owner of Whiteclay's grocery store, Arrowhead Foods, said he \"did more than a million dollars in business last year, with an entirely Native American clientele.\"<ref name=Woodward>[http://100r.org/2012/02/gold-mines-in-hell/ Stephanie Woodward, \"Gold Mines in Hell\"], 100Reporters, February 2012</ref> Similarly, Nebraska State Senator [[LeRoy J.

He said, \"That store was built because of the reservation.\"<ref name=Woodward/>\n\nThe tribe has prohibited sale and consumption of alcohol on the reservation, but Pine Ridge residents support four liquor stores at Whiteclay, which in 2010 paid federal and state excise taxes (included in liquor's sale price) of $413,932, according to the state liquor commission.<ref name=Woodward/> Some residents have argued that the continuing rate of alcoholism on the reservation shows the failure of the prohibition policy. They say that if the tribe legalized alcohol sales, it could keep much of the revenues now flowing to Nebraska and to state and federal taxes, and use such monies to bolster the reservation's economy and health care services, including building a much-needed detoxification facility and rehab services.\n\nDespite the lack of formal employment opportunities on Pine Ridge, considerable agricultural production is taking place on the reservation. Only a small percentage of the tribe directly benefits from this, as land is leased to agricultural producers. According to the [[USDA]], in 2002 there was nearly $33 million in receipts from agricultural production on Pine Ridge. Less than one-third of that income went to members of the tribe.<ref>[http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/amindian.pdf USDA 2002 \"Census of Agriculture for Native American Reservations\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615033245/http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/amindian.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nMost employment on the reservation is provided by community institutions, such as the tribal Oglala Lakota College, and other schools; the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA); and the U.S. [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS).

Grasses dominate the landscape.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/badl/naturescience/prairies.htm \"Badlands: Prairies\"], National Park Service</ref>\nThe short-grass and tall-grass prairies intergrade just east of an irregular line that runs from northern Texas through Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, northwestward into west-central North Dakota and South Dakota. The perimeter is not well defined because of the array of short-stature, intermediate, and tall-grass species that make up an [[ecotone]] between the short-grass and tall-grass prairies (Bragg and Steuter 1996). In general, the mixed-grass prairie is characterized by the warm-season grasses of the short-grass prairie to the west and the cool- and warm-season grasses, which grow much taller, to the east. Because of this ecotonal mixing, the number of plant species found in mixed-grass prairies exceeds that in other prairie types.<ref>[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/habitat/grlands/grasses.htm \"Habitat: Grasslands\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614024851/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/habitat/grlands/grasses.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}, United States Geological Service</ref> Since 2000, [[hemp]] has grown wild here, following a failed attempt in growing it commercially, as a local ordinance allows.
