The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use [[3D modelling]] software to generate [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house [[stereolithography]] machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the \"validation\" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the [[focus groups]]. [[Virtual model]]s of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions.

Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|title=The Lego prosthetic arm that children can create and hack themselves|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723183344/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|title=IKO Creative Prosthetic System|work=[[Core77]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184938/http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Clones of Lego ==\n{{Main|Lego clone}}\nThe definitive shape of the Lego bricks, with the inner tubes, was patented by the Lego Group in 1958.<ref name=\"Time50Years\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Austen|first1=Ian|title=Building a Legal Case, Block by Block|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 January 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122304/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Several competitors have attempted to take advantage of Lego's popularity by producing blocks of similar dimensions, and advertising them as being compatible with Lego bricks.

The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use [[3D modelling]] software to generate [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house [[stereolithography]] machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the \"validation\" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the [[focus groups]]. [[Virtual model]]s of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions.

There are also several unofficial programs and compatible programming languages that have been made to work with the brick, and many books have been written to support this community.<ref name=\"About EV3\" />\n\nThere are several robotics competitions which use the Lego robotics sets. The earliest is [[Botball]], a national U.S. [[middle school|middle]]- and [[high-school]] competition stemming from the MIT 6.270 Lego robotics tournament. Other Lego robotics competitions include [[FIRST Lego League Jr.|Junior FIRST LEGO League]] (Jr.FLL) for students ages 6\u20139 and [[FIRST Lego League]] (FLL) for students ages 9\u201316 (age 9\u201314 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico). Jr.FLL and FLL offer real-world engineering challenges to participants. FLL uses Lego-based robots to complete tasks. Jr.FLL participants build models out of Lego elements. In its 2010 season, there were 16,070 FLL teams in over 55 countries. In its 2010 season, there were 2,147 Jr.FLL teams with 12,882 total student participants in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Designs for these Lego prosthetics allow everything from mechanical diggers to laser-firing spaceships to be screwed on to the end of a child's limb. Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|title=The Lego prosthetic arm that children can create and hack themselves|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723183344/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|title=IKO Creative Prosthetic System|work=[[Core77]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184938/http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Clones of Lego ==\n{{Main|Lego clone}}\nThe definitive shape of the Lego bricks, with the inner tubes, was patented by the Lego Group in 1958.<ref name=\"Time50Years\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Austen|first1=Ian|title=Building a Legal Case, Block by Block|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 January 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122304/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Several competitors have attempted to take advantage of Lego's popularity by producing blocks of similar dimensions, and advertising them as being compatible with Lego bricks.

The work was greatly accelerated as the energy crisis increased the need for Swedish energy production. The power plant was commissioned in 1975. The power plant is located at the 18 meter high dam next to Lake Svegssj\u00f6n, a water reservoir that was created when the  [[Ljusnan]], Veman and H\u00e4rj\u00e5n rivers were dammed up in 1975.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1132030  |title =  Svegssj\u00f6n |website=   wikidata.org|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are two power plant facilities directly adjacent to the lake. Svegs kraftverk is the larger of the facilities, and the dam itself, is located near Sveg.

inhabitants in 2010.<ref name=scb />\n\n==Overview==\nSveg is the largest urban area in H\u00e4rjedalen and the fourth largest in the county of J\u00e4mtland. The [[Ljusnan]] river flows through the city.\nSveg is located on  Riksv\u00e4g 84 which runs from [[Hudiksvall]] in [[G\u00e4vleborg County]] to the Norwegian border where it connects with Fylkesvei 31 \nproviding a route to [[R\u00f8ros]].\nThe addition of railway lines, Orsa\u2013Svegs J\u00e4rnv\u00e4g between [[Orsa, Sweden|Orsa]] and Sveg  in 1909 together with connection line from \nSveg to [[Brunflo]]  in 1922 and between Sveg and [[Hede, Sweden|Hede]] in 1924, supported the development of large forest companies in the area.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.orsajf.se/  |title =   Orsa Jernv\u00e4gsf\u00f6rening|website=  orsajf.se|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSwedish author [[Henning Mankell]] (1948\u20132015) was brought up in Sveg, where his father was a district judge. Sveg  is the setting for his crime novel ''Dansl\u00e4rarens \u00e5terkomst'' (2000) which was translated by [[Laurie Thompson]] (1938\u20132015) into English as [[The Return of the Dancing Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/05/henning-mankell |title =   Henning Mankell|website=  The Guardian  \n|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/laurie-thompson-jbmlmglkg7s  |title =   Laurie Thompson|website=   The Times|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Svegsdammen.jpg|thumb|300px|Sveg Power Plant at Svegssj\u00f6n]]\n\n==Hydroelectric power plants==\nSveg Power Plant (''Svegs kraftverk'') is a hydroelectric power plant that began to be built in 1972. The work was greatly accelerated as the energy crisis increased the need for Swedish energy production. The power plant was commissioned in 1975. The power plant is located at the 18 meter high dam next to Lake Svegssj\u00f6n, a water reservoir that was created when the  [[Ljusnan]], Veman and H\u00e4rj\u00e5n rivers were dammed up in 1975.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1132030  |title =  Svegssj\u00f6n |website=   wikidata.org|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are two power plant facilities directly adjacent to the lake. Svegs kraftverk is the larger of the facilities, and the dam itself, is located near Sveg. The smaller power plant located at Kvarnforsen just south of Herr\u00f6 was built in 1966 and is owned by H\u00e4rje\u00e5ns Kraft AB.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.fortum.se/vara-vattenkraftverk/ljusnan/svegs-kraftverk   |title = Svegs kraftverk|website= Fortum|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.harjeans.se/|title =  H\u00e4rje\u00e5ns Kraft AB |website= harjeans.se \n|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.visitsveg.com/post_type_product/vid-svegssjon/|title =  Herr\u00f6\n|website=  visitsveg.com|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Sveg  Church==\n[[File:Kirche Sveg.JPG|thumb|left|Sveg Church]]\n\nSveg  Church (''Svegs kyrka'')  is located  in central Sveg. The church is of stone with towers and narrower sacristy. It was built in 1845-47.  \nThe present church is believed to have been preceded by at least three prior church buildings, the first of which was probably built in the late 1000s. Construction was under the direction of Jacob Norin (1795\u20131864) from  Norrala  in [[H\u00e4lsingland]]. The church includes an altar from 1623  and a pulpit from 1649.

In spite of it being in the middle of the Scandinavian landmass on such a high latitude and a bit elevated, the winters are somewhat milder than expected, due to the mild [[North Atlantic]] air that often rises temperatures. Summer days are often warm, many times averaging around {{convert|20|C|F}}, but nights are regularly cool, and frost can be recorded even in the midst of summer. In terms of Scandinavian climate, Sveg is an anomaly in that December is at least as cold as February, both averaging similar means.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Sveg 2002\u20132018; extremes since 1901\n|collapsed = \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 10.0\n|Feb record high C = 10.0\n|Mar record high C = 16.0\n|Apr record high C = 22.5\n|May record high C = 28.0\n|Jun record high C = 35.0\n|Jul record high C = 36.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.0\n|Sep record high C = 27.4\n|Oct record high C = 21.9\n|Nov record high C = 13.7\n|Dec record high C = 9.9\n|year record high C = 36.0\n|Jan avg record high C = 4.1\n|Feb avg record high C = 4.6\n|Mar avg record high C = 9.5\n|Apr avg record high C = 16.3\n|May avg record high C = 23.4\n|Jun avg record high C = 25.9\n|Jul avg record high C = 27.5\n|Aug avg record high C = 25.6\n|Sep avg record high C = 20.5\n|Oct avg record high C = 13.7\n|Nov avg record high C = 8.2\n|Dec avg record high C = 4.9\n|year avg record high C = 28.6\n|Jan high C = -4.1\n|Feb high C = -2.5\n|Mar high C = 2.2\n|Apr high C = 8.3\n|May high C = 14.3\n|Jun high C = 18.2\n|Jul high C = 21.2\n|Aug high C = 18.9\n|Sep high C = 13.9\n|Oct high C = 6.3\n|Nov high C = 0.8\n|Dec high C = -2.5\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = -8.1\n|Feb mean C = -6.4\n|Mar mean C = -2.7\n|Apr mean C = 3.0\n|May mean C = 8.5\n|Jun mean C = 12.4\n|Jul mean C = 15.4\n|Aug mean C = 13.4\n|Sep mean C = 9.2\n|Oct mean C = 2.7\n|Nov mean C = -2.4\n|Dec mean C = -6.5\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = -12.1\n|Feb low C = -10.2\n|Mar low C = -7.6\n|Apr low C = -2.4\n|May low C = 2.6\n|Jun low C = 6.5\n|Jul low C = 9.5\n|Aug low C = 7.9\n|Sep low C = 4.5\n|Oct low C = -0.9\n|Nov low C = -5.6\n|Dec low C = -10.5\n|year low C = \n|Jan avg record low C = -26.8\n|Feb avg record low C = -25.9\n|Mar avg record low C = -21.3\n|Apr avg record low C = -10.0\n|May avg record low C = -5.1\n|Jun avg record low C = -0.8\n|Jul avg record low C = 2.1\n|Aug avg record low C = 0.3\n|Sep avg record low C = -2.5\n|Oct avg record low C = -10.3\n|Nov avg record low C = -16.8\n|Dec avg record low C = -23.9\n|year avg record low C = -30.5\n|Jan record low C = -42.6\n|Feb record low C = -39.8\n|Mar record low C = -38.0\n|Apr record low C = -27.0\n|May record low C = -12.5\n|Jun record low C = -8.0\n|Jul record low C = -3.0\n|Aug record low C = -5.7\n|Sep record low C = -10.5\n|Oct record low C = -25.9\n|Nov record low C = -33.0\n|Dec record low C = -41.0\n|year record low C = -42.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 33.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 22.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 19.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 23.6\n|May precipitation mm = 51.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 73.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 88.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 95.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 45.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 42.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 34.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31.1\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = SMHI Open Data<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer/#param=precipitationMonthlySum,stations=all,stationid=124030\n| title = SMHI Open Data precipitation for Sveg\n| publisher = [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] | language = sv}}</ref>\n|source 2 = SMHI climate data 2002\u20132018<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/temperatur/2.1240\n| title = SMHI Monthly Statistics\n| language = sv \n| publisher = SMHI| date= 29 April 2019}}</ref>\n|date=29 April 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Svegs IK]]\n* [[Knatten]]\n*[[Sveg Airport]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Sveg}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n\n{{Localities in H\u00e4rjedalen Municipality}}\n{{J\u00e4mtland County}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in H\u00e4rjedalen Municipality]]\n[[Category:Municipal seats of J\u00e4mtland County]]\n[[Category:Swedish municipal seats]]\n[[Category:H\u00e4rjedalen]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSveg  Church:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1845-47 \u2192 1845\u201347", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveg"}

Young Magnet High School''' (locally known simply as '''Whitney Young''') is a [[state school|public]] [[magnet school|magnet]] [[high school]] and [[middle school]] located in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] neighborhood in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. Whitney Young is operated by the [[Chicago Public Schools]] district. Whitney Young opened on September 3, 1975 as the city's first public magnet high school. The school is named after [[Whitney Young|Whitney Moore Young Jr.]], a prominent African-American [[civil rights]] leader.\n\n==History==\nThe Chicago Public Schools announced plans for a public magnet school on the city's Near West Side in mid\u20131970. A proposal by community residents called for a high school to be built at 211 S. Laflin, which was an empty lot that had been burned out during the [[1968 Chicago riots|riots]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} following the assassination of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, 1968. The school opened on September 3, 1975, as a selective enrollment school under the leadership of the school's first principal, Bernarr E. Dawson.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Founding faculty===\nThe founding staff developed and planned the initial curriculum and policies for the school: Joe Korner (English), Jory Chelin (Math), Melanie Wojtulewicz (Science), Larry Minkoff (Social Studies), Roger Stewart (Tech), Sandra McKinley (Librarian), and Dr. William Marshall (Hearing Impaired). The principal's secretary was Lillian O'Neill. The staff met for months unpaid in the unused John Phillips Sousa school building while the Young building was under construction.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Background==\n===Admissions and Academic Center===\nAdmission to Young is granted based on entrance exam performance, standardized test scores, and elementary school grades, and is open to all residents of Chicago, Illinois. The school consistently scores among the top high schools in the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. In 2009, Young was awarded the [[National Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon Award]].\n\nThe academic center is an accelerated program for seventh and eighth graders. Seventh and eighth graders are immersed in an intense high school experience, taking courses for high school credit. Classes include Honors Algebra I and Honors Environmental Science in seventh grade, and Honors Geometry, Honors Survey of Literature, Honors World History and Honors Biology in eighth grade.  In addition, students are allowed to select up to two elective classes each year.  There are many extracurricular programs for the students who attend the Academic Center, including basketball, cross country, track and math team.\n\n===Science Bowl and Math Team===\nThe school's [[Science Bowl]] Team won the Regional National Science Bowl Championship in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. They advanced to the National Finals in Washington, D.C., representing the city of Chicago. Notable achievements include placing first in the Division Team Challenge at the National Finals in 2016.<ref>[https://science.energy.gov/~/media/wdts/nsb/pdf/2017-Media%20Releases-Regional%20Winners/Whitney-Young-Magnet-High-School-Chicago-Illinois.pdf]</ref> Young Math Team competes in several local and national competitions, including the City of Chicago Math League, the North Suburban Math League, the [[Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] competition, the American Mathematics Competitions, and the Mandelbrot Competition.

Young Magnet High School''' (locally known simply as '''Whitney Young''') is a [[state school|public]] [[magnet school|magnet]] [[high school]] and [[middle school]] located in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] neighborhood in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. Whitney Young is operated by the [[Chicago Public Schools]] district. Whitney Young opened on September 3, 1975 as the city's first public magnet high school. The school is named after [[Whitney Young|Whitney Moore Young Jr.]], a prominent African-American [[civil rights]] leader.\n\n==History==\nThe Chicago Public Schools announced plans for a public magnet school on the city's Near West Side in mid\u20131970. A proposal by community residents called for a high school to be built at 211 S. Laflin, which was an empty lot that had been burned out during the [[1968 Chicago riots|riots]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} following the assassination of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, 1968. The school opened on September 3, 1975, as a selective enrollment school under the leadership of the school's first principal, Bernarr E. Dawson.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Founding faculty===\nThe founding staff developed and planned the initial curriculum and policies for the school: Joe Korner (English), Jory Chelin (Math), Melanie Wojtulewicz (Science), Larry Minkoff (Social Studies), Roger Stewart (Tech), Sandra McKinley (Librarian), and Dr. William Marshall (Hearing Impaired). The principal's secretary was Lillian O'Neill. The staff met for months unpaid in the unused John Phillips Sousa school building while the Young building was under construction.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Background==\n===Admissions and Academic Center===\nAdmission to Young is granted based on entrance exam performance, standardized test scores, and elementary school grades, and is open to all residents of Chicago, Illinois. The school consistently scores among the top high schools in the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. In 2009, Young was awarded the [[National Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon Award]].\n\nThe academic center is an accelerated program for seventh and eighth graders. Seventh and eighth graders are immersed in an intense high school experience, taking courses for high school credit. Classes include Honors Algebra I and Honors Environmental Science in seventh grade, and Honors Geometry, Honors Survey of Literature, Honors World History and Honors Biology in eighth grade.  In addition, students are allowed to select up to two elective classes each year.  There are many extracurricular programs for the students who attend the Academic Center, including basketball, cross country, track and math team.\n\n===Science Bowl and Math Team===\nThe school's [[Science Bowl]] Team won the Regional National Science Bowl Championship in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. They advanced to the National Finals in Washington, D.C., representing the city of Chicago.

In the age of constitutionalism he was 24, chivalrous, brave, unparallel in sincerity and famous for patriotism and reliance upon God. Subsequent to British occupation of [[Bushehr]], Rais Ali courageously resisted the aggressors and imposed heavy defeats on them. After occupation of [[Bushehr]], British forces decided to take over Delvar, a place they had earlier experienced heavy defeats.

In reality, Persian forces were affected by the rivalry between the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the [[Central Powers]] and took sides based on the conditions. Western interest in Persia was based on its significant oil reserve and its strategic situation between [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and the warring Ottoman, Russian, and British Empires. Persia was divided into northern and southern spheres of influence under the [[Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907]]. The treaty defined their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] in Iran and Afghanistan and provided a counterweight to German influence.  This treaty was widely viewed by Iranians as having made the nation into nothing more than a British and Russian [[protectorate]], so during the World War I, many local rebellions occurred in Iran against the British and Russian forces [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|participating]] in war against Central powers of World War I.  In Northern Iran, [[Jangal movement of Gilan]], was the main operating local force against the British and Russians forces, and in Southern Iran, [[Lurs|Lurs (BoyerAhmadi)]] , [[Tangestan County|Tangistani]] and [[Laristan]]i tribes were the main resisting power against the British empire. In both Southern and Northern movements, [[Persian Central Government Gendarmerie]] supported the rebels (See [[Persian Campaign]] ).\n\n===German rule===\n\nGermany established their [[Intelligence Bureau for the East]] on the eve of World War I, dedicated to promoting and sustaining subversive and nationalist agitations in [[British India]] and the Persian and [[Egypt]]ian satellite states.

In late 1920 [[Mohammad Mossadegh]], the new governor-general of F\u0101rs, reinstated \u1e62awlat-al-Dawla to the office of \u012bl\u1e35\u0101n\u012b. The [[South Persia Rifles]] ended its activities following the British supported coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 1921, which was followed by the formation of a modern army in Persia and the eventual suppression of tribal rebels.<ref name=\"Ashraffars\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to Iranian [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (Iran)|Minister of Islamic Culture and Guidance]],the Islamic Republic of Iran has designated September 3 as day of combat against British colonialism in Iran.The day is devoted to sacrifices of Rais Ali Delvari, and will be registered in official calendars.<ref>[http://persiaht.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2308:sep-3-day-of-combat-against-british-colonialism&catid=42:iran&Itemid=2 Persia Herald tribune]</ref> The [[Rais Ali Dilavari Dam]], is named after this person .\n\n==See also==\n*[[Postage stamps of Bushire under British occupation]]\n*[[Wilhelm Wassmuss]]\n*[[Persian Campaign]]\n*[[Jangal movement of Gilan]]\n*[[Colonel Pessian]]\n*[[Khalou Hossein Bord Khuni Dashti]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.caroun.com/Museums/IranMuseum/IranMRegion2/DelvarMuseum.html Delvar Ethnological Museum]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delvari, Rais Ali}}\n[[Category:People from Tangestan]]\n", "name_user": "Fahambnd", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed excessive commas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rais_Ali_Delvari"}

It is a [[disaccharide]], a molecule composed of two [[monosaccharides]]: [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Sucrose is produced naturally in plants, from which [[table sugar]] is refined. It has the [[molecular formula]] C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>.\n\nFor human consumption, sucrose is extracted and refined from either [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]. [[Sugar mill]]s &ndash; typically located in [[tropics|tropical regions]] near where sugarcane is grown &ndash; crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose. Sugar beet factories are located in [[temperate climate]]s where the beet is grown, and process the beets directly into refined sugar. The sugar refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals before dissolving them into a sugar syrup which is filtered and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour. The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum and crystallized as the final purification process to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.\n\nSugar is often an added ingredient in food production and food [[recipe]]s. About 185 million [[tonne]]s of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017.<ref name=\"prod2017\">{{cite news|title=World 2017/18 sugar production, consumption seen at record: USDA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sugar-usda-supplies/world-2017-18-sugar-production-consumption-seen-at-record-usda-idUSKBN1DH2LV|newspaper=Reuters|author=Marcy Nicholson|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''sucrose'' was coined in 1857 by the English chemist [[William Allen Miller|William Miller]]<ref>William Allen Miller, ''Elements of Chemistry:  Theoretical and Practical'', Part III.

The abbreviated term ''Suc'' is often used for ''sucrose'' in scientific literature.\n\nThe name ''saccharose'' was coined in 1860 by the French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]].<ref>Marcellin Berthelot, ''Chimie organique fond\u00e9e sur la synth\u00e8se'' (Paris, France:  Mallet-Bachelier, 1860),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&pg=PA254#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 254\u201355] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627013507/http://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&pg=PA254 |date=2014-06-27 }}.</ref> Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose.\n\n==Physical and chemical properties==\n\n===Structural O-\u03b1-<small>D</small>-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-<small>D</small>-fructofuranoside===\nIn sucrose, the components glucose and fructose are linked via an ether bond between C1 on the [[glucosyl]] subunit and C2 on the fructosyl unit. The bond is called a [[glycosidic linkage]]. Glucose exists predominantly as two isomeric \"pyranoses\" (\u03b1 and \u03b2), but only one of these forms links to the fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of \"furanoses\", each of which having \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-[[reducing sugar]].\n\nSucrose crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]] [[space group]] P2<sub>1</sub> with room-temperature lattice parameters ''a'' = 1.08631&nbsp;nm, ''b'' = 0.87044&nbsp;nm, ''c'' = 0.77624&nbsp;nm, \u03b2 = 102.938\u00b0.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Acta Crystallogr|year = 1952|volume = 5|pages = 689\u201390|doi = 10.1107/S0365110X52001908|title = The crystal structure of sucrose|author1=Beevers, C.

Sucrose is found naturally in many food plants along with the [[monosaccharide]] [[fructose]]. In many fruits, such as [[pineapple]] and [[apricot]], sucrose is the main sugar.

In the local Indian language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (\u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921), which is the source of the word ''candy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sugarcane: Saccharum Offcinarum|publisher=USAID, Govt of United States|year=2006|page=7.1|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106015828/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag%26environ/Sugarcane.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\nThe army of Alexander the Great was halted on the banks of river [[Indus River|Indus]] by the refusal of his troops to go further east. They saw people in the Indian subcontinent growing sugarcane and making ''granulated, salt-like sweet powder'', locally called ''s\u0101khar'' (\u0938\u093e\u0916\u0930), pronounced as ''sakcharon'' (\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) in Greek (Modern Greek, ''zachari'' \u03b6\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7). On their return journey, the Greek soldiers carried back some of the \"honey-bearing reeds\". Sugarcane remained a limited crop for over a millennium. Sugar was a rare commodity and traders of sugar became wealthy. Venice, at the height of its financial power, was the chief sugar-distributing center of Europe.<ref name=gr1>{{cite book|title=Something about sugar: its history, growth, manufacture and distribution|author=Rolph, George |year=1873|url=https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutsu00rolprich}}</ref> Arabs started producing it in [[Sicily]] and [[Spain]]. Only after the [[Crusades]] did it begin to rival honey as a sweetener in Europe. The Spanish began cultivating sugarcane in the [[West Indies]] in 1506 ([[Cuba]] in 1523). The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first cultivated sugarcane in [[Brazil]] in 1532.\n\nSugar remained a luxury in much of the world until the 18th century. Only the wealthy could afford it. In the 18th century, the demand for table sugar boomed in Europe and by the 19th century it had become regarded as a human necessity.<ref name=mintz/> The use of sugar grew from use in tea, to [[cake]]s, [[candy|confectionery]] and [[chocolate]]s. Suppliers marketed sugar in novel forms, such as solid cones, which required consumers to use a [[sugar nips|sugar nip]], a pliers-like tool, in order to break off pieces.\n\nThe demand for cheaper table sugar drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and table sugar manufacturing could thrive. Growing sugar cane crop in hot humid climates, and producing table sugar in high temperature sugar mills was harsh, inhumane work. The demand for cheap and docile labor for this work, in part, first drove slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa), followed by indentured labor trade from South Asia (in particular India).<ref name=britain1>{{cite web|title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204015712/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|archivedate=2016-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Lai, Walton|title=Indentured labor, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838\u20131918|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8018-7746-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Vertovik, Steven|editor=Cohen, Robin|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57 57\u201368]|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57}}</ref> Millions of slaves, followed by millions of indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, East Africa, Natal, north and eastern parts of South America, and southeast Asia.

An expressway for transport is visible in the lower left.]]\n\nTable sugar (sucrose) comes from plant sources. Two important sugar crops predominate: [[sugarcane]] (''Saccharum spp.'') and [[sugar beet]]s (''Beta vulgaris''), in which sugar can account for 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the [[date palm]] (''Phoenix dactylifera''), [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum vulgare''), and the [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water; concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2017, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 185 million tonnes.<ref name=prod2017/>\n\nMost cane sugar comes from countries with warm climates, because sugarcane does not tolerate frost. Sugar beets, on the other hand, grow only in cooler temperate regions and do not tolerate extreme heat. About 80 percent of sucrose is derived from sugarcane, the rest almost all from sugar beets.\n\nIn mid-2018, India and Brazil had about the same production of sugar &ndash; 34 million tonnes &ndash; followed by the [[European Union]], [[Thailand]], and China as the major producers.<ref name=\"usda2018\">{{cite web |title=Sugar: World Markets and Trade |url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/sugar.pdf |publisher=Office of Global Analysis, Foreign Agricultural Service, US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=21 December 2018 |date=4 November 2018}}</ref> India, the European Union, and China were the leading domestic consumers of sugar in 2018.<ref name=usda2018/>\n\nBeet sugar comes from regions with cooler climates: northwest and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some areas in the United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing&nbsp;\u2013 the industry can store harvested beets until processed, but a frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.\n\nThe United States sets high sugar prices to support its producers, with the effect that many former purchasers of sugar have switched to [[corn syrup]] (beverage manufacturers) or moved out of the country (candy manufacturers).\n\nThe low prices of [[glucose syrup]]s produced from [[wheat]] and corn ([[maize]]) threaten the traditional sugar market. Used in combination with [[artificial sweetener]]s, they can allow drink manufacturers to produce very low-cost goods.\n\n====High-fructose corn syrup====\n{{main|High-fructose corn syrup}}\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is significantly cheaper as a sweetener for food and beverage manufacturing than refined sucrose.<ref name=\"berk\">{{cite web |author1=Densie Webb |title=Is High-Fructose Corn Syrup Worse Than Regular Sugar? |url=https://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/article/high-fructose-corn-syrup-worse-regular-sugar |publisher=Berkeley Wellness, University of California - Berkeley |accessdate=19 September 2019 |date=7 June 2017}}</ref> This has led to sucrose being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.<ref name=berk/><ref name=tara/>\n\nAlthough reports in public media regard HFCS as unhealthy,<ref name=berk/><ref name=\"tara\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A04E6DA143FF932A1575AC0A9669D8B63.html|author=Parker-Pope, Tara|title=In Worries About Sweeteners, Think of All Sugars|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> clinical [[dietitian]]s, medical professionals, and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) dismiss such concerns because \"Sucrose, HFCS, invert sugar, honey, and many fruits and juices deliver the same sugars in the same ratios to the same tissues within the same time frame to the same metabolic pathways\".<ref name=berk/><ref name=\"fda2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm|title=High Fructose Corn Syrup: Questions and Answers|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> While scientific authorities agree that dietary sugars are a source of [[empty calorie]]s associated with certain health problems, the belief that glucose-fructose syrups such as HFCS are especially unhealthy is not supported by scientific evidence.<ref name=berk/><ref name=fda2014/> Health authorities and the FDA recommend limiting the overall consumption of sugar-based sweeteners.<ref name=berk/><ref name=tara/><ref name=fda2014/>\n\n===Types===\n\n====Cane====\n{{Main|Sugarcane}}\n[[File:Cut sugarcane.jpg|thumb|Harvested sugarcane from Venezuela ready for processing]]\nSince the 6th century BC, cane sugar producers have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane in order to collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with [[calcium oxide|lime (calcium oxide)]]) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually in the process of stirring, to produce sugar crystals. [[Centrifuge]]s usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.\n\nSugarcane is a major component of Brazilian agriculture; the country is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and its derivative products, such as crystallized sugar and [[ethanol]] ([[ethanol fuel]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Sugarcane Producing Countries: Brazil outperforms its next 6 closest competitors combined|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-sugarcane-producing-countries.html|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Beet====\n[[File:SugarBeet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sugar beets]]\n{{Main|Sugar beet}}\nBeet sugar producers slice the washed beets, then extract the sugar with hot water in a \"[[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]]\". An alkaline solution (\"[[Lime water|milk of lime]]\" and [[carbon dioxide]] from the lime kiln) then serves to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] impurities (see [[carbonatation]]). After filtration,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} evaporation concentrates the juice to a content of about 70% solids, and controlled crystallisation extracts the sugar. A centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the liquid, which gets recycled in the crystalliser stages. When economic constraints prevent the removal of more sugar, the manufacturer discards the remaining liquid, now known as [[molasses]], or sells it on to producers of animal feed.\n\nSieving the resultant white sugar produces different grades for selling.\n\n=====Cane versus beet=====\nIt is difficult to distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and cane. One way is by [[isotope analysis]] of carbon. Cane uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], and beet uses [[C3 carbon fixation]], resulting in a different ratio of [[carbon 13|<sup>13</sup>C]] and [[carbon 12|<sup>12</sup>C]] isotopes in the sucrose. Tests are used to detect fraudulent abuse of [[European Union]] subsidies or to aid in the detection of adulterated [[fruit juice]].\n\nSugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the production of sugar cane needs approximately four times as much water as the production of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as [[Egypt]]) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. Some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period in that way.\n\nThe production of sugar leaves residues that differ substantially depending on the raw materials used and on the place of production. While cane [[molasses]] is often used in food preparation, humans find molasses from sugar beets unpalatable, and it consequently ends up mostly as industrial [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] feedstock (for example in [[ethanol|alcohol]] distilleries), or as [[compound feed|animal feed]]. Once dried, either type of molasses can serve as fuel for burning.\n\nPure beet sugar is difficult to find, so labelled, in the marketplace. Although some  makers label their product clearly as \"pure cane sugar\", beet sugar is almost always labeled simply as sugar or pure sugar. Interviews with the 5 major beet sugar-producing companies revealed that many store brands or \"private label\" sugar products are pure beet sugar. The lot code can be used to identify the company and the plant from which the sugar came, enabling beet sugar to be identified if the codes are known.<ref>[http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf January 2010 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162218/http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf |date=2010-09-24 }}, IBS Treatment Center</ref>\n\n====Culinary sugars====\n[[File:Raw sugar closeup.jpg|thumb|Grainy raw sugar]]\n\n=====Mill white=====\nMill white, also called plantation white, crystal sugar or superior sugar is produced from raw sugar.

Blanco directo is more pure than mill white sugar, but less pure than white refined.\n\n=====White refined=====\n{{See also|White sugar}}\nWhite refined is the most common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by dissolving and purifying raw sugar using [[phosphoric acid]] similar to the method used for blanco directo, a [[carbonatation]] process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further purified by filtration through a bed of [[activated carbon]] or [[bone char]].

Brown sugar's color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.\n\n===Measurement===\n\n====Dissolved sugar content====\nScientists and the [[sugar industry]] use degrees [[Brix]] (symbol \u00b0Bx), introduced by [[Adolf Ferdinand Wenceslaus Brix|Adolf Brix]], as units of measurement of the mass ratio of dissolved substance to water in a liquid. A 25 \u00b0Bx sucrose solution has 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose per 100&nbsp;grams of liquid; or, to put it another way, 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose sugar and 75&nbsp;grams of water exist in the 100&nbsp;grams of solution.\n\nThe Brix degrees are measured using an infrared sensor. This measurement does not equate to Brix degrees from a density or refractive index measurement, because it will specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When using a refractometer, one should report the result as \"[[refractometric dried substance]]\" (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as having 20 \u00b0Bx RDS. This refers to a measure of percent by weight of ''total'' dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since sucrose in fact forms the majority of dried solids. The advent of in-line infrared Brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount of dissolved sugar in products economical using a direct measurement.\n\n==Consumption==\n{{Main|History of sugar}}\nRefined sugar was a luxury before the 18th century. It became widely popular in the 18th century, then graduated to becoming a necessary food in the 19th century. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes.<ref name=mintz>{{cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|author=Mintz, Sidney|isbn=978-0-14-009233-2|year=1986|publisher=Penguin|url=https://archive.org/details/sweetnesspowerpl00mint}}</ref> Eventually, table sugar became sufficiently cheap and common enough to influence standard cuisine and flavored drinks.\n\nSucrose forms a major element in [[confectionery]] and [[dessert]]s.

These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable ''S. mutans'', ''S. sanguinis'' and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist natural removal, e.g. by flow of saliva, although they are easily removed by brushing. The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.\nSuch a special role of sucrose in the formation of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.\n\n====Glycemic index====\nSucrose is a [[disaccharide]] made up of 50% [[glucose]] and 50% [[fructose]] and has a [[glycemic index]] of 65.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolever|first=Thomas M.

It is a [[disaccharide]], a molecule composed of two [[monosaccharides]]: [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Sucrose is produced naturally in plants, from which [[table sugar]] is refined. It has the [[molecular formula]] C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>.\n\nFor human consumption, sucrose is extracted and refined from either [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]. [[Sugar mill]]s &ndash; typically located in [[tropics|tropical regions]] near where sugarcane is grown &ndash; crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose. Sugar beet factories are located in [[temperate climate]]s where the beet is grown, and process the beets directly into refined sugar. The sugar refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals before dissolving them into a sugar syrup which is filtered and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour. The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum and crystallized as the final purification process to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.\n\nSugar is often an added ingredient in food production and food [[recipe]]s. About 185 million [[tonne]]s of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017.<ref name=\"prod2017\">{{cite news|title=World 2017/18 sugar production, consumption seen at record: USDA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sugar-usda-supplies/world-2017-18-sugar-production-consumption-seen-at-record-usda-idUSKBN1DH2LV|newspaper=Reuters|author=Marcy Nicholson|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''sucrose'' was coined in 1857 by the English chemist [[William Allen Miller|William Miller]]<ref>William Allen Miller, ''Elements of Chemistry:  Theoretical and Practical'', Part III.

The bond is called a [[glycosidic linkage]]. Glucose exists predominantly as two isomeric \"pyranoses\" (\u03b1 and \u03b2), but only one of these forms links to the fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of \"furanoses\", each of which having \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-[[reducing sugar]].\n\nSucrose crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]] [[space group]] P2<sub>1</sub> with room-temperature lattice parameters ''a'' = 1.08631&nbsp;nm, ''b'' = 0.87044&nbsp;nm, ''c'' = 0.77624&nbsp;nm, \u03b2 = 102.938\u00b0.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Acta Crystallogr|year = 1952|volume = 5|pages = 689\u201390|doi = 10.1107/S0365110X52001908|title = The crystal structure of sucrose|author1=Beevers, C.

In the local Indian language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (\u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921), which is the source of the word ''candy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sugarcane: Saccharum Offcinarum|publisher=USAID, Govt of United States|year=2006|page=7.1|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106015828/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag%26environ/Sugarcane.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\nThe army of Alexander the Great was halted on the banks of river [[Indus River|Indus]] by the refusal of his troops to go further east. They saw people in the Indian subcontinent growing sugarcane and making ''granulated, salt-like sweet powder'', locally called ''s\u0101khar'' (\u0938\u093e\u0916\u0930), pronounced as ''sakcharon'' (\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) in Greek (Modern Greek, ''zachari'' \u03b6\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7). On their return journey, the Greek soldiers carried back some of the \"honey-bearing reeds\". Sugarcane remained a limited crop for over a millennium. Sugar was a rare commodity and traders of sugar became wealthy. Venice, at the height of its financial power, was the chief sugar-distributing center of Europe.<ref name=gr1>{{cite book|title=Something about sugar: its history, growth, manufacture and distribution|author=Rolph, George |year=1873|url=https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutsu00rolprich}}</ref> Arabs started producing it in [[Sicily]] and [[Spain]]. Only after the [[Crusades]] did it begin to rival honey as a sweetener in Europe. The Spanish began cultivating sugarcane in the [[West Indies]] in 1506 ([[Cuba]] in 1523). The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first cultivated sugarcane in [[Brazil]] in 1532.\n\nSugar remained a luxury in much of the world until the 18th century. Only the wealthy could afford it. In the 18th century, the demand for table sugar boomed in Europe and by the 19th century it had become regarded as a human necessity.<ref name=mintz/> The use of sugar grew from use in tea, to [[cake]]s, [[candy|confectionery]] and [[chocolate]]s. Suppliers marketed sugar in novel forms, such as solid cones, which required consumers to use a [[sugar nips|sugar nip]], a pliers-like tool, in order to break off pieces.\n\nThe demand for cheaper table sugar drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and table sugar manufacturing could thrive. Growing sugar cane crop in hot humid climates, and producing table sugar in high temperature sugar mills was harsh, inhumane work. The demand for cheap and docile labor for this work, in part, first drove slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa), followed by indentured labor trade from South Asia (in particular India).<ref name=britain1>{{cite web|title=Forced Labour|year=2010|publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204015712/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm|archivedate=2016-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Lai, Walton|title=Indentured labor, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838\u20131918|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8018-7746-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Vertovik, Steven|editor=Cohen, Robin|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57 57\u201368]|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgesurveyo00robi/page/57}}</ref> Millions of slaves, followed by millions of indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, East Africa, Natal, north and eastern parts of South America, and southeast Asia.

The [[steam engine]] first powered a sugar mill in [[Jamaica]] in 1768, and, soon after, steam replaced direct firing as the source of process heat. During the same century, Europeans began experimenting with sugar production from other crops. [[Andreas Marggraf]] identified sucrose in [[beet root]]<ref>Marggraf (1747) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Experiences chimiques faites dans le dessein de tirer un veritable sucre de diverses plantes, qui croissent dans nos contr\u00e9es\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624083152/https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA79 |date=2016-06-24 }} [Chemical experiments made with the intention of extracting real sugar from diverse plants that grow in our lands], ''Histoire de l'acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin'', pp. 79\u201390.</ref> and his student [[Franz Achard]] built a sugar beet processing factory in Silesia (Prussia).

An expressway for transport is visible in the lower left.]]\n\nTable sugar (sucrose) comes from plant sources. Two important sugar crops predominate: [[sugarcane]] (''Saccharum spp.'') and [[sugar beet]]s (''Beta vulgaris''), in which sugar can account for 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the [[date palm]] (''Phoenix dactylifera''), [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum vulgare''), and the [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water; concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2017, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 185 million tonnes.<ref name=prod2017/>\n\nMost cane sugar comes from countries with warm climates, because sugarcane does not tolerate frost. Sugar beets, on the other hand, grow only in cooler temperate regions and do not tolerate extreme heat. About 80 percent of sucrose is derived from sugarcane, the rest almost all from sugar beets.\n\nIn mid-2018, India and Brazil had about the same production of sugar &ndash; 34 million tonnes &ndash; followed by the [[European Union]], [[Thailand]], and China as the major producers.<ref name=\"usda2018\">{{cite web |title=Sugar: World Markets and Trade |url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/sugar.pdf |publisher=Office of Global Analysis, Foreign Agricultural Service, US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=21 December 2018 |date=4 November 2018}}</ref> India, the European Union, and China were the leading domestic consumers of sugar in 2018.<ref name=usda2018/>\n\nBeet sugar comes from regions with cooler climates: northwest and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some areas in the United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing&nbsp;\u2013 the industry can store harvested beets until processed, but a frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.\n\nThe United States sets high sugar prices to support its producers, with the effect that many former purchasers of sugar have switched to [[corn syrup]] (beverage manufacturers) or moved out of the country (candy manufacturers).\n\nThe low prices of [[glucose syrup]]s produced from [[wheat]] and corn ([[maize]]) threaten the traditional sugar market. Used in combination with [[artificial sweetener]]s, they can allow drink manufacturers to produce very low-cost goods.\n\n====High-fructose corn syrup====\n{{main|High-fructose corn syrup}}\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is significantly cheaper as a sweetener for food and beverage manufacturing than refined sucrose.<ref name=\"berk\">{{cite web |author1=Densie Webb |title=Is High-Fructose Corn Syrup Worse Than Regular Sugar? |url=https://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/article/high-fructose-corn-syrup-worse-regular-sugar |publisher=Berkeley Wellness, University of California - Berkeley |accessdate=19 September 2019 |date=7 June 2017}}</ref> This has led to sucrose being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.<ref name=berk/><ref name=tara/>\n\nAlthough reports in public media regard HFCS as unhealthy,<ref name=berk/><ref name=\"tara\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A04E6DA143FF932A1575AC0A9669D8B63.html|author=Parker-Pope, Tara|title=In Worries About Sweeteners, Think of All Sugars|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> clinical [[dietitian]]s, medical professionals, and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) dismiss such concerns because \"Sucrose, HFCS, invert sugar, honey, and many fruits and juices deliver the same sugars in the same ratios to the same tissues within the same time frame to the same metabolic pathways\".<ref name=berk/><ref name=\"fda2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm|title=High Fructose Corn Syrup: Questions and Answers|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> While scientific authorities agree that dietary sugars are a source of [[empty calorie]]s associated with certain health problems, the belief that glucose-fructose syrups such as HFCS are especially unhealthy is not supported by scientific evidence.<ref name=berk/><ref name=fda2014/> Health authorities and the FDA recommend limiting the overall consumption of sugar-based sweeteners.<ref name=berk/><ref name=tara/><ref name=fda2014/>\n\n===Types===\n\n====Cane====\n{{Main|Sugarcane}}\n[[File:Cut sugarcane.jpg|thumb|Harvested sugarcane from Venezuela ready for processing]]\nSince the 6th century BC, cane sugar producers have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane in order to collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with [[calcium oxide|lime (calcium oxide)]]) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually in the process of stirring, to produce sugar crystals. [[Centrifuge]]s usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.\n\nSugarcane is a major component of Brazilian agriculture; the country is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and its derivative products, such as crystallized sugar and [[ethanol]] ([[ethanol fuel]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Sugarcane Producing Countries: Brazil outperforms its next 6 closest competitors combined|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-sugarcane-producing-countries.html|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Beet====\n[[File:SugarBeet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sugar beets]]\n{{Main|Sugar beet}}\nBeet sugar producers slice the washed beets, then extract the sugar with hot water in a \"[[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]]\". An alkaline solution (\"[[Lime water|milk of lime]]\" and [[carbon dioxide]] from the lime kiln) then serves to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] impurities (see [[carbonatation]]). After filtration,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} evaporation concentrates the juice to a content of about 70% solids, and controlled crystallisation extracts the sugar. A centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the liquid, which gets recycled in the crystalliser stages. When economic constraints prevent the removal of more sugar, the manufacturer discards the remaining liquid, now known as [[molasses]], or sells it on to producers of animal feed.\n\nSieving the resultant white sugar produces different grades for selling.\n\n=====Cane versus beet=====\nIt is difficult to distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and cane. One way is by [[isotope analysis]] of carbon. Cane uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], and beet uses [[C3 carbon fixation]], resulting in a different ratio of [[carbon 13|<sup>13</sup>C]] and [[carbon 12|<sup>12</sup>C]] isotopes in the sucrose. Tests are used to detect fraudulent abuse of [[European Union]] subsidies or to aid in the detection of adulterated [[fruit juice]].\n\nSugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the production of sugar cane needs approximately four times as much water as the production of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as [[Egypt]]) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. Some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period in that way.\n\nThe production of sugar leaves residues that differ substantially depending on the raw materials used and on the place of production. While cane [[molasses]] is often used in food preparation, humans find molasses from sugar beets unpalatable, and it consequently ends up mostly as industrial [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] feedstock (for example in [[ethanol|alcohol]] distilleries), or as [[compound feed|animal feed]]. Once dried, either type of molasses can serve as fuel for burning.\n\nPure beet sugar is difficult to find, so labelled, in the marketplace. Although some  makers label their product clearly as \"pure cane sugar\", beet sugar is almost always labeled simply as sugar or pure sugar. Interviews with the 5 major beet sugar-producing companies revealed that many store brands or \"private label\" sugar products are pure beet sugar. The lot code can be used to identify the company and the plant from which the sugar came, enabling beet sugar to be identified if the codes are known.<ref>[http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf January 2010 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162218/http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf |date=2010-09-24 }}, IBS Treatment Center</ref>\n\n====Culinary sugars====\n[[File:Raw sugar closeup.jpg|thumb|Grainy raw sugar]]\n\n=====Mill white=====\nMill white, also called plantation white, crystal sugar or superior sugar is produced from raw sugar. It is exposed to [[sulfur dioxide]] during the production to reduce the concentration of color compounds and helps prevent further color development during the crystallization process. Although common to sugarcane-growing areas, this product does not store or ship well. After a few weeks, its impurities tend to promote discoloration and clumping; therefore this type of sugar is generally limited to local consumption.<ref>{{cite book | author = Steindl, Roderick | date = 2005 | title = Syrup Clarification for Plantation White Sugar to meet New Quality Standards | editor = Hogarth, DM | work = Proceedings of the XXV Congress of International Society of Sugar Cane Technologists | pages = 106\u201316 | location = Guatemala, Guatemala City | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4888/1/4888_1.pdf | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130810042657/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4888/1/4888_1.pdf | archivedate = 2013-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n=====Blanco directo=====\nBlanco directo, a white sugar common in India and other south Asian countries, is produced by precipitating many impurities out of cane juice using [[phosphoric acid]] and [[calcium hydroxide]], similar to the [[carbonatation]] technique used in beet sugar refining. Blanco directo is more pure than mill white sugar, but less pure than white refined.\n\n=====White refined=====\n{{See also|White sugar}}\nWhite refined is the most common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by dissolving and purifying raw sugar using [[phosphoric acid]] similar to the method used for blanco directo, a [[carbonatation]] process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further purified by filtration through a bed of [[activated carbon]] or [[bone char]]. Beet sugar refineries produce refined white sugar directly without an intermediate raw stage.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}\n\nWhite refined sugar is typically sold as '''''granulated sugar,''''' which has been dried to prevent clumping and comes in various crystal sizes for home and industrial use:\n[[Image:Sucre blanc cassonade complet rapadura.jpg|thumb|Sugars; clockwise from top left: Refined, unrefined, brown, unprocessed cane]]\n* {{Anchor|Coarse-grain}}'''Coarse-grain''', such as ''sanding sugar'' (also called \"pearl sugar\", \"decorating sugar\", ''nibbed sugar'' or ''sugar nibs'') is a coarse grain sugar used to add sparkle and flavor atop baked goods and candies.

Brown sugar's color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.\n\n===Measurement===\n\n====Dissolved sugar content====\nScientists and the [[sugar industry]] use degrees [[Brix]] (symbol \u00b0Bx), introduced by [[Adolf Ferdinand Wenceslaus Brix|Adolf Brix]], as units of measurement of the mass ratio of dissolved substance to water in a liquid. A 25 \u00b0Bx sucrose solution has 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose per 100&nbsp;grams of liquid; or, to put it another way, 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose sugar and 75&nbsp;grams of water exist in the 100&nbsp;grams of solution.\n\nThe Brix degrees are measured using an infrared sensor. This measurement does not equate to Brix degrees from a density or refractive index measurement, because it will specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When using a refractometer, one should report the result as \"[[refractometric dried substance]]\" (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as having 20 \u00b0Bx RDS. This refers to a measure of percent by weight of ''total'' dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since sucrose in fact forms the majority of dried solids. The advent of in-line infrared Brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount of dissolved sugar in products economical using a direct measurement.\n\n==Consumption==\n{{Main|History of sugar}}\nRefined sugar was a luxury before the 18th century. It became widely popular in the 18th century, then graduated to becoming a necessary food in the 19th century. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes.<ref name=mintz>{{cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|author=Mintz, Sidney|isbn=978-0-14-009233-2|year=1986|publisher=Penguin|url=https://archive.org/details/sweetnesspowerpl00mint}}</ref> Eventually, table sugar became sufficiently cheap and common enough to influence standard cuisine and flavored drinks.\n\nSucrose forms a major element in [[confectionery]] and [[dessert]]s.

These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable ''S. mutans'', ''S. sanguinis'' and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist natural removal, e.g. by flow of saliva, although they are easily removed by brushing. The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.\nSuch a special role of sucrose in the formation of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.\n\n====Glycemic index====\nSucrose is a [[disaccharide]] made up of 50% [[glucose]] and 50% [[fructose]] and has a [[glycemic index]] of 65.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolever|first=Thomas M.

A diet rich in sucrose may lead to gout as it raises the level of insulin, which prevents excretion of uric acid from the body.

It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population.\n\nInferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.\n\n== Introduction ==\nStatistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) [[Model selection|selecting]] a [[statistical model]] of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nKonishi & Kitagawa state, \"The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling\".<ref>Konishi & Kitagawa (2008), p. 75.</ref>  Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, \"How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis\".<ref>Cox (2006), p. 197.</ref>\n\nThe [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] of a statistical inference is a statistical [[proposition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Statistical_inference |title=Statistical inference - Encyclopedia of Mathematics |website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org |access-date=2019-01-23 }}</ref> Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following:\n* a [[point estimate]], i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest; \n* an [[interval estimate]], e.g. a [[confidence interval]] (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the [[frequency probability|probability]] at the stated [[confidence level]];\n* a [[credible intervals|credible interval]], i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;\n* rejection of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]];{{NoteTag|According to Peirce, acceptance means that inquiry on this question ceases for the time being.

A '''statistical model''' is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference.<ref name=Cox2006>Cox (2006) page 2</ref> Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Michael |title=Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty |year=2004 |publisher=Freeman and Company|page=267|display-authors=etal |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hkWK8kFzXWIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22descriptive%20statistics%22&f=false |isbn=9780716747420 }}</ref>\n\n=== Degree of models/assumptions ===\nStatisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions;\n* '''[[Parametric model|Fully parametric]]''': The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters.<ref name=Cox2006/> For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]]. The family of [[Generalized linear model#Model components|generalized linear models]] is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.\n* '''[[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|Non-parametric]]''': The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal.<ref>van der Vaart, A.W. (1998) ''Asymptotic Statistics''  Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-78450-6}} (page 341)</ref> For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the [[Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator|Hodges\u2013Lehmann\u2013Sen estimator]], which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.\n* '''[[Semiparametric model|Semi-parametric]]''': This term typically implies assumptions 'in between' fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any [[heteroscedasticity]]). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into 'structural' and 'random variation' components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known [[Cox model]] is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.\n\n=== Importance of valid models/assumptions ===\n{{See also|Statistical model validation}}\n\nWhatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.\n\nIncorrect assumptions of [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]] can invalidate statistical inference.<ref>Kruskal 1988</ref> More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions.<ref>\n[[David A. Freedman|Freedman, D.A.]] (2008) \"Survival analysis: An Epidemiological hazard?\".

In this approach, the [[metric geometry]] of [[probability distribution]]s is studied; this approach quantifies approximation error with, for example, the [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]], [[Bregman divergence]], and the [[Hellinger distance]].<ref>Le Cam (1986) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erik Torgerson (1991) ''Comparison of Statistical Experiments'', volume 36 of Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the [[generalized method of moments]] and the use of [[generalized estimating equation]]s, which are popular in [[econometrics]] and [[biostatistics]]. The magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution (formally, the 'error' of the approximation) can be assessed using simulation<!-- and approximation results -->.<ref>Pfanzagl (1994) : \"By taking a limit theorem as being approximately true for large sample sizes, we commit an error the size of which is unknown.

These schools&mdash;or \"paradigms\"&mdash;are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.\n\nBandyopadhyay & Forster<ref>Bandyopadhyay & Forster (2011). The quote is taken from the book's Introduction (p.3).  See also \"Section&nbsp;III: Four Paradigms of Statistics\".</ref>  describe four paradigms: \"(i) classical statistics or error statistics, (ii) Bayesian statistics, (iii) likelihood-based statistics, and (iv) the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based statistics\".  The classical (or [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]]) paradigm, the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] paradigm, the [[Likelihoodism|likelihoodist]] paradigm, and the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]]-based paradigm are summarized below.\n\n=== Frequentist inference ===\n{{Main|Frequentist inference}}\n\nThis paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset's characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified\u2014although in practice this quantification may be challenging.\n\n==== Examples of frequentist inference ====\n* [[p-value|''p''-value]]\n* [[Confidence interval]]\n\n==== Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory ====\nOne interpretation of [[frequentist inference]] (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of [[frequency probability]]; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman<ref>{{cite journal | last = Neyman | first = J. | author-link = Jerzy Neyman | year = 1937 | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability | jstor = 91337 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 236 | issue = 767| pages = 333\u2013380 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005 }}</ref> develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.\n\nThe frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to [[utility function]]s. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as [[statistical decision theory]], do incorporate [[utility function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]s, or [[uniformly most powerful test]]ing) make use of [[loss function]]s, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property.<ref>Preface to Pfanzagl.</ref> However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under [[absolute value]] loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and [[least squares]] estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.\n\nWhile statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the [[estimators]]/[[Test statistic#Common test statistics|test statistic]] to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as 'objective'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Roderick J.|date=2006|title=Calibrated Bayes: A Bayes/Frequentist Roadmap|journal=The American Statistician|volume=60|issue=3|pages=213\u2013223|issn=0003-1305|jstor=27643780|doi=10.1198/000313006X117837}}</ref>\n\n===Bayesian inference===\n{{See also|Bayesian Inference}}\n\nThe Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the 'language' of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate to one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are [[Bayesian probability#Justification of Bayesian probabilities|several different justifications]] for using the Bayesian approach.\n\n====Examples of Bayesian inference====\n\n* [[Credible interval]] for [[interval estimation]]\n* [[Bayes factor]]s for model comparison\n\n====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====\n\nMany informal Bayesian inferences are based on \"intuitively reasonable\" summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user's [[utility function]] need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been [[Bayesian probability#Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors|proposed]] but not yet fully developed.)\n\nFormally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the 'Bayes rule' is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides [[optimal decision]]s in a [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) [[Coherence (statistics)|incoherent]]; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be [[Coherence (statistics)|coherent]]. Some advocates of [[Bayesian inference]] assert that inference ''must'' take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that [[Bayesian inference]] should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.\n\n===Likelihood-based inference===\n{{Main|Likelihoodism}}\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[Likelihoodism]] approaches statistics by using the [[likelihood function]]. Some likelihoodists reject inference, considering statistics as only computing support from evidence. Others, however, propose inference based on the likelihood function, of which the best-known is [[maximum likelihood estimation]].\n\n===AIC-based inference===\n{{Main|Akaike information criterion}}\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\nThe ''[[Akaike information criterion]]'' (AIC) is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].\n\nAIC is founded on [[information theory]]: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)\n\n===Other paradigms for inference===\n\n====Minimum description length====\n{{Main|Minimum description length}}\n\nThe minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in [[information theory]]<ref name=\"Soofi 2000 1349\u20131353\">Soofi (2000)</ref> and the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref name=HY>Hansen & Yu (2001)</ref>  The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable \"data-generating mechanisms\" or [[probability models]] for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.\n\nHowever, if a \"data generating mechanism\" does exist in reality, then according to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s [[source coding theorem]] it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically.<ref name=HY747>Hansen and Yu (2001), page 747.</ref> In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (using [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum-entropy]] [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian priors]]). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.<ref name=HY747/><ref name=JR>Rissanen (1989), page 84</ref>\n\nThe MDL principle has been applied in communication-[[coding theory]] in [[information theory]], in [[linear regression]],<ref name=JR/> and in [[data mining]].<ref name=HY/>\n\nThe evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from [[computational complexity theory]].<ref>Joseph F.

In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability,  and even fallacious.<ref>Neyman (1956)</ref><ref>Zabell (1992)</ref> However this argument is the same as that which shows<ref>Cox (2006) page 66</ref>  that a so-called [[confidence distribution]] is not a valid [[probability distribution]] and, since this has not invalidated the application of [[confidence interval]]s, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments. An attempt was made to reinterpret the early work of Fisher's [[Fiducial probability|fiducial argument]] as a special case of an inference theory using [[Upper and lower probabilities]].{{sfn|Hampel|2003}}\n\n====Structural inference====\n\nDeveloping ideas of Fisher and of Pitman from 1938 to 1939,<ref>Davison, page 12. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> [[George A.

A '''statistical model''' is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference.<ref name=Cox2006>Cox (2006) page 2</ref> Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Michael |title=Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty |year=2004 |publisher=Freeman and Company|page=267|display-authors=etal |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hkWK8kFzXWIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22descriptive%20statistics%22&f=false |isbn=9780716747420 }}</ref>\n\n=== Degree of models/assumptions ===\nStatisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions;\n* '''[[Parametric model|Fully parametric]]''': The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters.<ref name=Cox2006/> For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]]. The family of [[Generalized linear model#Model components|generalized linear models]] is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.\n* '''[[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|Non-parametric]]''': The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal.<ref>van der Vaart, A.W. (1998) ''Asymptotic Statistics''  Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-78450-6}} (page 341)</ref> For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the [[Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator|Hodges\u2013Lehmann\u2013Sen estimator]], which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.\n* '''[[Semiparametric model|Semi-parametric]]''': This term typically implies assumptions 'in between' fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any [[heteroscedasticity]]). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into 'structural' and 'random variation' components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known [[Cox model]] is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.\n\n=== Importance of valid models/assumptions ===\n{{See also|Statistical model validation}}\n\nWhatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.\n\nIncorrect assumptions of [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]] can invalidate statistical inference.<ref>Kruskal 1988</ref> More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions.<ref>\n[[David A. Freedman|Freedman, D.A.]] (2008) \"Survival analysis: An Epidemiological hazard?\".

For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the [[generalized method of moments]] and the use of [[generalized estimating equation]]s, which are popular in [[econometrics]] and [[biostatistics]].

[. . .] Realistic information about the remaining errors may be obtained by simulations.\" (page ix)\n</ref> The heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications, especially with low-dimensional [[statistical model|models]] with [[logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] [[likelihood function|likelihood]]s (such as with one-parameter [[exponential families]]).\n\n===Randomization-based models===\n{{Main|Randomization}}\n{{See also|Random sample|Random assignment}}\n\nFor a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design, the randomization distribution of a statistic (under the null-hypothesis) is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design.

These schools&mdash;or \"paradigms\"&mdash;are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.\n\nBandyopadhyay & Forster<ref>Bandyopadhyay & Forster (2011). The quote is taken from the book's Introduction (p.3).  See also \"Section&nbsp;III: Four Paradigms of Statistics\".</ref>  describe four paradigms: \"(i) classical statistics or error statistics, (ii) Bayesian statistics, (iii) likelihood-based statistics, and (iv) the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based statistics\".  The classical (or [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]]) paradigm, the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] paradigm, the [[Likelihoodism|likelihoodist]] paradigm, and the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]]-based paradigm are summarized below.\n\n=== Frequentist inference ===\n{{Main|Frequentist inference}}\n\nThis paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset's characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified\u2014although in practice this quantification may be challenging.\n\n==== Examples of frequentist inference ====\n* [[p-value|''p''-value]]\n* [[Confidence interval]]\n\n==== Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory ====\nOne interpretation of [[frequentist inference]] (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of [[frequency probability]]; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman<ref>{{cite journal | last = Neyman | first = J. | author-link = Jerzy Neyman | year = 1937 | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability | jstor = 91337 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 236 | issue = 767| pages = 333\u2013380 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005 }}</ref> develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.\n\nThe frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to [[utility function]]s. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as [[statistical decision theory]], do incorporate [[utility function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]s, or [[uniformly most powerful test]]ing) make use of [[loss function]]s, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property.<ref>Preface to Pfanzagl.</ref> However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under [[absolute value]] loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and [[least squares]] estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.\n\nWhile statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the [[estimators]]/[[Test statistic#Common test statistics|test statistic]] to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as 'objective'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Roderick J.|date=2006|title=Calibrated Bayes: A Bayes/Frequentist Roadmap|journal=The American Statistician|volume=60|issue=3|pages=213\u2013223|issn=0003-1305|jstor=27643780|doi=10.1198/000313006X117837}}</ref>\n\n===Bayesian inference===\n{{See also|Bayesian Inference}}\n\nThe Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the 'language' of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate to one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are [[Bayesian probability#Justification of Bayesian probabilities|several different justifications]] for using the Bayesian approach.\n\n====Examples of Bayesian inference====\n\n* [[Credible interval]] for [[interval estimation]]\n* [[Bayes factor]]s for model comparison\n\n====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====\n\nMany informal Bayesian inferences are based on \"intuitively reasonable\" summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user's [[utility function]] need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been [[Bayesian probability#Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors|proposed]] but not yet fully developed.)\n\nFormally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the 'Bayes rule' is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides [[optimal decision]]s in a [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) [[Coherence (statistics)|incoherent]]; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be [[Coherence (statistics)|coherent]]. Some advocates of [[Bayesian inference]] assert that inference ''must'' take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that [[Bayesian inference]] should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.\n\n===Likelihood-based inference===\n{{Main|Likelihoodism}}\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[Likelihoodism]] approaches statistics by using the [[likelihood function]]. Some likelihoodists reject inference, considering statistics as only computing support from evidence. Others, however, propose inference based on the likelihood function, of which the best-known is [[maximum likelihood estimation]].\n\n===AIC-based inference===\n{{Main|Akaike information criterion}}\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\nThe ''[[Akaike information criterion]]'' (AIC) is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].\n\nAIC is founded on [[information theory]]: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)\n\n===Other paradigms for inference===\n\n====Minimum description length====\n{{Main|Minimum description length}}\n\nThe minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in [[information theory]]<ref name=\"Soofi 2000 1349\u20131353\">Soofi (2000)</ref> and the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref name=HY>Hansen & Yu (2001)</ref>  The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable \"data-generating mechanisms\" or [[probability models]] for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.\n\nHowever, if a \"data generating mechanism\" does exist in reality, then according to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s [[source coding theorem]] it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically.<ref name=HY747>Hansen and Yu (2001), page 747.</ref> In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (using [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum-entropy]] [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian priors]]). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.<ref name=HY747/><ref name=JR>Rissanen (1989), page 84</ref>\n\nThe MDL principle has been applied in communication-[[coding theory]] in [[information theory]], in [[linear regression]],<ref name=JR/> and in [[data mining]].<ref name=HY/>\n\nThe evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from [[computational complexity theory]].<ref>Joseph F.

In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability,  and even fallacious.<ref>Neyman (1956)</ref><ref>Zabell (1992)</ref> However this argument is the same as that which shows<ref>Cox (2006) page 66</ref>  that a so-called [[confidence distribution]] is not a valid [[probability distribution]] and, since this has not invalidated the application of [[confidence interval]]s, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments.
