Following the demise of his first wife, he marries Muthu Lakshmi Ammal so that the child from his marriage will not grow up without the love and care of a mother. Unknown to him, Muthu Lakshmi already has a son, who she called muthu.\n\nOn the night of the wedding, Muthu knocks at the door of Raja Rathnam Pillai, demanding that he be shown his mother. Once Raja Rathnam comes to know the truth, he takes Muthu into his care, giving him love, affection and a new name, \"Rajamanikyam\". Muthu returns the favour duly, as when Raja Rathnam's son ends up killing one of the children of the village, he takes the blame and leaves the village.\nSeveral years later, Raja Rathnam's two grown-up children, Rajaselvam ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) and Rani Rathnam ([[Sindhu Menon]]), start fighting for their father's wealth. Rajaselvam, aided by his childhood buddy Simon Nadar ([[Ranjith (actor)|Ranjith]]) also notches up a plot to frame his own father in a murder case. As a result, Raja Rathnam is arrested, but dies of a heart attack while being taken to prison. After his death the two siblings call the family lawyer to read out Raja Rathnam's will in public. But to their surprise, they find that control of all the assets of their father have been given to a cattle dealer in [[Bellary]], known by the name of Bellary Raja ([[Mammootty]]), a billionaire. They fail to recognize that Bellary Raja is none other than Rajamanikyam. How Rajamanikyam returns to his home town to unite the warring siblings forms the rest of the story.\n\nDuring the course of the movie, Rajaselvam and Rani Rathnam tries to thwart Bellary Raja in order to regain control of their father's wealth. But Bellary Raja never falls for any of their attempts and he uses his secretary, educated Raju([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]) to stabilize the assets of his stepfather and prevents it from getting into the hands of his siblings, thereby preserving it. Raja effectively uses the help of his thug friends to restore order in the establishment. Simon and Rajaselvam send a goon to kill Bellary from his blind side. However Bellary thwart the attempt, causing him minor wound., Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument. Simon Nadar, who wants to harm Rajaselvam, betrays him and he is held by one of his old trade partner, who demands a lot of money for the release of Rajaselvam. Rani, unknown to this, blame Rajamanikyam in order deny them their control on their father's wealth.  Rajamanikyam comes to his rescue, pays the required amount of money to release Rajaselvam. He emotionally reveals that he is none other than Rajaselvam's stepbrother and Rani's elder brother. Feeling regret to fulfill his father's wish to unite their family, He leave and prepare to go back. At night Rajaselvam, being drunk came to Bellary and apologize to him where both of them settle their old enmities. He ask Bellary not to leave them and reveal the truth behind their father's death. Towards the end of the movie, Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument which turns into a fight. Selvam, beaten badly by Simon and his goons was about to be killed. However Bellary and his men came to rescue and fight off Simon.\n\nAt the Climax, Bellari releases a bull towards Simon for killing his father and trying to destroy his family and kills him. He reunited with Rajaselvam and takes him home. The movie ends when Rajamanikyam, who is half-blind, says, \"Now I have both eyes\", signifying Raju (whom he considers a brother) and Rajaselvam.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Rajamanikyam aka Bellary Raja(stepson of Raja Rathnam Pillai)\n* [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]] as Raju\n* [[Manoj K.

He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019.

As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]]. He skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m from [[Lit, Sweden|Lit]], formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals. Team Eriksson came in second place to the team from Sundyberg skipped by his future teammate [[Rasmus Wran\u00e5]], who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lindstr\u00f6m, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His primary team during this period was with his team from Lit, which he skipped first as part of Team Lindstr\u00f6m and then as Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>. From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, his primary team became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]].

for the [[Niklas Edin]] rink. He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]]. He skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m, formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals. Team Eriksson came in second place to the team from Sundyberg skipped by his future teammate [[Rasmus Wran\u00e5]], who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lindstr\u00f6m, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His primary team during this period was with his team from Lit, which he skipped first as part of Team Lindstr\u00f6m and then as Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>. From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, his primary team became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]].

He was also a president of the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC).\n\nGuillion played college basketball for [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] from 1921 to 1924, leading the [[Big Ten Conference]] in scoring in 1922. Following his playing career, Gullion coached at the high school level and in 1927 was named head coach for Earlham College. He coached there for eight seasons and led the program to its only undefeated season in school history, going 15\u20130 in the 1932\u201333 campaign.<ref name=EC>{{cite news|title=Coach Gullion provided many memories for EC|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/252781008/?terms=Blair%2BGullion%2BIndiana%2Bbasketball%2Bhall%2Bof%2Bfame|newspaper=[[Palladium-Item]]|date=February 23, 1999|page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 11, 2017}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his time at Earlham, Gullion moved to [[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]], where he went 47\u201319 over three seasons, and then [[Cornell Big Red men's basketball|Cornell]], where he went 48\u201343 over four seasons.

It lies on the rivers [[Wertach River|Wertach]] and [[Singold]], on the edge of the Augsburg-Westliche W\u00e4lder Nature Park, in [[Augsburg (district)|Augsburg District]], some 13&nbsp;km south of [[Augsburg]] itself.\n\n== History ==\nThe placename \"Bobingen\" goes back to the [[Alamanni]]c settler \"Pobo\" (''ca'' 506). About 993, Bobingen was called \"Pobinga\" (\"at Pobo's people's house\"). Also about 993 came Bobingen's first documentary mention in the ''Vita S. Udalrici''. Bobingen in today's administrative region of [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia]] was later an administrative centre of the Augsburg Church Estate. As a result of the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803, the city came under Bavarian [[sovereignty]]. In 1847, the [[railway]] arrived, joining Bobingen to [[Lindau]] and [[Hof, Germany|Hof]]. In 1899, the [[rayon]] factory was founded, starting production in 1902. In 1953, the town was raised to [[market town]], and in 1969 to city. In 1972, the communities of Stra\u00dfberg, Reinhartshausen and Burgwalden were amalgamated into Bobingen. Bobingen now belongs to the Augsburg district. In 1975, the communities of Waldberg and Kreuzanger were also amalgamated into Bobingen. In 1993, the city hall (Singoldhalle) was completed. In 1994, the city held a thousandth-anniversary celebration, as well as celebrating 25 years as a city. In 2004, the city saw the completion of the rehabilitation and expansion of the city [[hospital]]. In 2005, the city's buildings underwent beautification.\n\n=== The Bobingen ''\"B\u00fcble\"'' Legend ===\nThere is more than one version of the story about the Bobingen ''B\u00fcble'' (\"lad\" or \"young man\"). In a second, later version, the story even ends with the characters' arrest and execution. This, however, cannot be true from an historical point of view, as there were no [[gallows]] in Bobingen, and therefore no hangings could be carried out. The Church Estate's [[Blutgericht|High Justice]] establishment had its execution place at [[Schwabm\u00fcnchen]].\n\nThe following legend is the earliest version, drawn from Alexander Sch\u00f6ppner's \"Bayerische Sagen\" (Bavarian Legends):\n\n:''Three hours south of Augsburg on the so-called Hochstra\u00dfe (a \"high road\", built on embankments or viaducts), lies the great and beautiful village of Bobingen. There, however, it is not good to ask \"Wo geht's Bobingen zu?\" (\"How does one get to Bobingen\"), and quite a few have ended up with bloody heads from it. At the least one will be mauled with insult and scoffing, and with blasphemous talk, whomever one wishes to ask. This came about as follows: Once, a long time ago, there was a young man from Bobingen who was prosecuted before a court. The accused appealed to a [[lawyer]] with a good name in Augsburg to fight his case for him. He advised the young man to behave like an idiot before the court, to answer every question asked of him by saying \"Bobingen zu\" (which is rather nonsensical), at the same time pointing with his right hand under his nose from right to left. He did just as he was advised, and since neither a confession nor anything else could be got out of him, the court released him. After a time, he came to the town on business and met the lawyer, who was curious to know the case's outcome. After hearing of the fortunate success, he said \"It is now time for you to pay me for this advice; I demand two Karolins for my troubles.\"''\n\n:''The young man, however, replied with a \"Bobingen zu\", turned round the street corner and since that time has left the lawyer waiting for his fee.''\n\n== Constituent communities ==\n*[[Central business district|''Kernstadt'']] with Bobingen-Siedlung (pop. 14,403)\n*[[Stadtteil]] Stra\u00dfberg (pop. 1,142)\n*Burgwalden (pop. 80)\n*Reinhartshausen (pop. 571)\n*Waldberg (pop. 424)\n*Kreuzanger (pop. 167)\n\n== Politics ==\nThe mayor has been, since 1996, Bernd M\u00fcller ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).\n\nPlaces on the 25-seat city council are apportioned as follows (as of municipal elections in 2014):<ref>https://www.stadt-bobingen.de/Mandatstraeger.n311.html</ref>\n\n* SPD: 10 seats\n* [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]: 9 seats\n* \"[[Free Voters]]\" (non-aligned citizens' group): 2 seat\n* Free Citizens' Union: 2 seat\n* [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]]: 2 seat\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\n'''Arms description''': Azure a peak argent, therein a horseshoe sable.\n\n'''Arms history''': The meaning of the [[horseshoe]] in the municipal coat of arms is not entirely clear. The horseshoe could to some be a reminder of a once intensive horse raising industry in the town. Others see in it a reference to finding horseshoes \u2013 which happens often around Bobingen \u2013 which are called \"Ungarneisen\" (\"[[Hungary]] irons\"). They supposedly date from the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (10 August 955) in which the Hungarians were defeated. A seal from the time around 1815 with a horseshoe in the shield has its roots in a local emblem that places along the so-called ''Hochstra\u00dfe'', following then [[Prince-Bishop]] Clemens Wenzeslaus von Sachsen's (1739\u20131812) wishes, assumed for marking border stones, border posts, and even posts around pastures. After the national emblem was bestowed by King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] in 1837, the municipal arms bore the [[National colours of Germany|Bavarian national colours]] overlaid with the black horseshoe.\n\n=== City partnership ===\nSince 1969 there has been a city partnership with the [[France|French]] town of [[Aniche]].\n\n== Education ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n*Staatl. [[Realschule]]\n*Dr. Jaufmann [[Hauptschule]]\n*Laurentius Grundschule ([[primary school]])\n*Freie Aktive Schule\n*Grundschule Bobingen an der Singold (primary)\n*Krankenpflegeschule im St\u00e4dt. Krankenhaus ([[nursing school]])\n\n== Hospital ==\nThe hospital of Bobingen is located at the Wertachstra\u00dfe 55, next to the river Wertach. The formerly municipal hospital belongs since 2006, together with the hospital of [[Schwabm\u00fcnchen]], to the Komunalunternehmen (city owned company) Wertachkliniken (wertach hospitals), owned by the cities Bobingen and Schwabm\u00fcnchen. The official name is Wertachklinik (Wertach Hospital) Bobingen. The Wertachklinik Bobingen provides the main departments anaesthesiology, trauma and reconstructive surgery and internal medicine and the departments gynaecology and midwifery, ENT and plastic surgery with attending doctors. All departments together provide 130 beds. The first hospital in Bobingen was founded in 1858.\n\n== Public safety==\n\n*Police\nThe police station of Bobingen is located at the Hochstra\u00dfe (high street) 22 in Bobingen.\nThe area of responsibility is the town of Bobingen, the town of K\u00f6nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen and Wehringen.\n\n*Rescue service\nThe rescue station of the Bavarian Red Cross is located at the Krumbacher Stra\u00dfe 4A in Bobingen.\nHere a rescue ambulance and a patient transport ambulance are stationed. There is no fixed area of responsibility for the rescue service. The [[Public-safety answering point]] (PSAP) of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the rescue service. The PSAP is always alerting the closest rescue vehicle to an emergency. Administrative borders like counties etc. do not matter here. The area of operation is about the south of Augsburg County and the town of Augsburg itself.\n\n*Fire brigade\nThe fire station of the volunteer fire brigade of Bobingen is located at Michael-Sch\u00e4ffer-Stra\u00dfe 12 in Bobingen. Here a L\u00f6schzug (platoon for fire fighting) and a R\u00fcstzug (platoon for technical relief, e.g. traffic collisions) are stationed. The PSAP of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the fire brigade, also. Therefore there is no fixed area of responsibility for the fire brigade. The area of operation is about the town of Bobingen itself and the district Siedlung and for support all other districts of Bobingen and the town of K\u00f6nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen, Wehringen und Gro\u00dfaitingen.\nThe volunteer fire brigade of Bobingen was founded in 1871. The fire brigade is alarmed about 130 times per year.<ref name=\"FDBobingen\">[http://www.feuerwehr-bobingen.de Fire Brigade Bobingen].</ref>\n\nThe districts Stra\u00dfberg, Reinhartshausen and Waldberg/Kreuzanger do have independent fire brigades with one small fire truck, each.\n\n== Culture und sightseeing ==\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n* St. Wolfgang- und Wendelin-Kapelle (chapel)\n* St. Felizitas\n* Rokoko-Wallfahrtskirche Mariae Himmelfahrt (Rococo Pilgrimage Church)\n* [[Mosque]]\n\n=== Other sights ===\n* Late mediaeval wayside atonement cross\n* Lower ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen'' (small palace)\n* Middle mill\n* Middle ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* Holy cross ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* Upper mill\n* [[Brewery]] and former [[Public house#Inns|inn]]\n* Cosimosinisches Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen\n* Upper ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* [[Milestone]] from historic [[Roman road]]\n* Stauden-Haus\n* Singoldhalle (City hall)\n* Bobinger B\u00fcble (a sculpture relating to the story above)\n* Westliche W\u00e4lder Nature Park\n\n<gallery>\nFile:St._Felizitas_Kirche_Bobingen.JPG|St.Felizitas Church\nFile:Stadthalle_Bobingen.JPG|Singoldhalle (City hall)\nFile:Sp\u00e4tmittelalterliches_S\u00fchnekreuz.JPG|Late mediaeval wayside atonement cross\nFile:Mittlere_M\u00fchle_Bobingen.JPG|Middle mill\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n* Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] passes a few kilometres north of [[Augsburg]].\n* Bundesstra\u00dfe (Federal highway) 17B east of Bobingen, B 300 north of Bobingen.\n* Railway line [[Augsburg]] \u2013 [[Buchloe]].\n* Railway line [[Augsburg]] \u2013 [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]].\n\n==Personalities==\n* [[Roy Black (singer)|Roy Black]] (1943\u20131991), was a German hit singer and [[actor]] in many German musical films\n* [[Marco Holzer]] (born 1988) Formula BMW driver and won the 2005 Formula BMW World Series in Bahrain\n* [[Andreas Farny]] (born 1992) ice hockey player\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{dmoz|World/Deutsch/Regional/Europa/Deutschland/Bayern/Landkreise/Augsburg/St\u00e4dte_und_Gemeinden/Bobingen}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Augsburg (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Augsburg (district)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Bobingen in Bavaria|B\u00f6bingen in Rhineland-Palatinate|B\u00f6bingen|B\u00f6bingen in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|B\u00f6bingen an der Rems}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox German location\n|name = Bobingen\n|image_coa = Wappen Bobingen.svg\n|image_photo = Rathaus Bobingen.JPG\n|image_caption = Town hall\n|image_plan = Bobingen in A.svg\n|state = Bavaria\n|regbzk = Schwaben\n|district = [[Augsburg (district)|Augsburg]]\n|population_ref = \n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 09772125\n|pop_dens = 333\n|area = 50.45\n|elevation = 500\n|coordinates = {{coord|48|16|N|10|49|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| lat_hem = N | lon_hem = E\n|postal_code = 86399\n|area_code = 08234\n|licence = A\n|mayor = Bernd M\u00fcller\n|party = SPD\n|website = [https://www.stadt-bobingen.de/ www.stadt-bobingen.de]\n}}\n\n'''Bobingen''' ([[Swabian German|Swabian]]: ''Boobenge''<ref>[[:gsw:Bobingen|Bobingen]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}</ref>) is a [[Town#Germany|town]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

He advised the young man to behave like an idiot before the court, to answer every question asked of him by saying \"Bobingen zu\" (which is rather nonsensical), at the same time pointing with his right hand under his nose from right to left. He did just as he was advised, and since neither a confession nor anything else could be got out of him, the court released him. After a time, he came to the town on business and met the lawyer, who was curious to know the case's outcome. After hearing of the fortunate success, he said \"It is now time for you to pay me for this advice; I demand two Karolins for my troubles.\"''\n\n:''The young man, however, replied with a \"Bobingen zu\", turned round the street corner and since that time has left the lawyer waiting for his fee.''\n\n== Constituent communities ==\n*[[Central business district|''Kernstadt'']] with Bobingen-Siedlung (pop. 14,403)\n*[[Stadtteil]] Stra\u00dfberg (pop. 1,142)\n*Burgwalden (pop. 80)\n*Reinhartshausen (pop. 571)\n*Waldberg (pop. 424)\n*Kreuzanger (pop. 167)\n\n== Politics ==\nThe mayor has been, since 1996, Bernd M\u00fcller ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).\n\nPlaces on the 25-seat city council are apportioned as follows (as of municipal elections in 2014):<ref>https://www.stadt-bobingen.de/Mandatstraeger.n311.html</ref>\n\n* SPD: 10 seats\n* [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]: 9 seats\n* \"[[Free Voters]]\" (non-aligned citizens' group): 2 seat\n* Free Citizens' Union: 2 seat\n* [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]]: 2 seat\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\n'''Arms description''': Azure a peak argent, therein a horseshoe sable.\n\n'''Arms history''': The meaning of the [[horseshoe]] in the municipal coat of arms is not entirely clear. The horseshoe could to some be a reminder of a once intensive horse raising industry in the town. Others see in it a reference to finding horseshoes \u2013 which happens often around Bobingen \u2013 which are called \"Ungarneisen\" (\"[[Hungary]] irons\"). They supposedly date from the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (10 August 955) in which the Hungarians were defeated. A seal from the time around 1815 with a horseshoe in the shield has its roots in a local emblem that places along the so-called ''Hochstra\u00dfe'', following then [[Prince-Bishop]] Clemens Wenzeslaus von Sachsen's (1739\u20131812) wishes, assumed for marking border stones, border posts, and even posts around pastures. After the national emblem was bestowed by King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] in 1837, the municipal arms bore the [[National colours of Germany|Bavarian national colours]] overlaid with the black horseshoe.\n\n=== City partnership ===\nSince 1969 there has been a city partnership with the [[France|French]] town of [[Aniche]].\n\n== Education ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n*Staatl. [[Realschule]]\n*Dr. Jaufmann [[Hauptschule]]\n*Laurentius Grundschule ([[primary school]])\n*Freie Aktive Schule\n*Grundschule Bobingen an der Singold (primary)\n*Krankenpflegeschule im St\u00e4dt. Krankenhaus ([[nursing school]])\n\n== Hospital ==\nThe hospital of Bobingen is located at the Wertachstra\u00dfe 55, next to the river Wertach. The formerly municipal hospital belongs since 2006, together with the hospital of [[Schwabm\u00fcnchen]], to the Komunalunternehmen (city owned company) Wertachkliniken (wertach hospitals), owned by the cities Bobingen and Schwabm\u00fcnchen. The official name is Wertachklinik (Wertach Hospital) Bobingen. The Wertachklinik Bobingen provides the main departments anaesthesiology, trauma and reconstructive surgery and internal medicine and the departments gynaecology and midwifery, ENT and plastic surgery with attending doctors. All departments together provide 130 beds. The first hospital in Bobingen was founded in 1858.\n\n== Public safety==\n\n*Police\nThe police station of Bobingen is located at the Hochstra\u00dfe (high street) 22 in Bobingen.\nThe area of responsibility is the town of Bobingen, the town of K\u00f6nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen and Wehringen.\n\n*Rescue service\nThe rescue station of the Bavarian Red Cross is located at the Krumbacher Stra\u00dfe 4A in Bobingen.\nHere a rescue ambulance and a patient transport ambulance are stationed. There is no fixed area of responsibility for the rescue service. The [[Public-safety answering point]] (PSAP) of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the rescue service. The PSAP is always alerting the closest rescue vehicle to an emergency. Administrative borders like counties etc. do not matter here. The area of operation is about the south of Augsburg County and the town of Augsburg itself.\n\n*Fire brigade\nThe fire station of the volunteer fire brigade of Bobingen is located at Michael-Sch\u00e4ffer-Stra\u00dfe 12 in Bobingen. Here a L\u00f6schzug (platoon for fire fighting) and a R\u00fcstzug (platoon for technical relief, e.g. traffic collisions) are stationed. The PSAP of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the fire brigade, also. Therefore there is no fixed area of responsibility for the fire brigade. The area of operation is about the town of Bobingen itself and the district Siedlung and for support all other districts of Bobingen and the town of K\u00f6nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen, Wehringen und Gro\u00dfaitingen.\nThe volunteer fire brigade of Bobingen was founded in 1871. The fire brigade is alarmed about 130 times per year.<ref name=\"FDBobingen\">[http://www.feuerwehr-bobingen.de Fire Brigade Bobingen].</ref>\n\nThe districts Stra\u00dfberg, Reinhartshausen and Waldberg/Kreuzanger do have independent fire brigades with one small fire truck, each.\n\n== Culture und sightseeing ==\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n* St. Wolfgang- und Wendelin-Kapelle (chapel)\n* St. Felizitas\n* Rokoko-Wallfahrtskirche Mariae Himmelfahrt (Rococo Pilgrimage Church)\n* [[Mosque]]\n\n=== Other sights ===\n* Late mediaeval wayside atonement cross\n* Lower ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen'' (small palace)\n* Middle mill\n* Middle ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* Holy cross ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* Upper mill\n* [[Brewery]] and former [[Public house#Inns|inn]]\n* Cosimosinisches Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen\n* Upper ''Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen''\n* [[Milestone]] from historic [[Roman road]]\n* Stauden-Haus\n* Singoldhalle (City hall)\n* Bobinger B\u00fcble (a sculpture relating to the story above)\n* Westliche W\u00e4lder Nature Park\n\n<gallery>\nFile:St._Felizitas_Kirche_Bobingen.JPG|St.Felizitas Church\nFile:Stadthalle_Bobingen.JPG|Singoldhalle (City hall)\nFile:Sp\u00e4tmittelalterliches_S\u00fchnekreuz.JPG|Late mediaeval wayside atonement cross\nFile:Mittlere_M\u00fchle_Bobingen.JPG|Middle mill\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n* Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] passes a few kilometres north of [[Augsburg]].\n* Bundesstra\u00dfe (Federal highway) 17B east of Bobingen, B 300 north of Bobingen.\n* Railway line [[Augsburg]] \u2013 [[Buchloe]].\n* Railway line [[Augsburg]] \u2013 [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]].\n\n==Personalities==\n* [[Roy Black (singer)|Roy Black]] (1943\u20131991), was a German hit singer and [[actor]] in many German musical films\n* [[Marco Holzer]] (born 1988) Formula BMW driver and won the 2005 Formula BMW World Series in Bahrain\n* [[Andreas Farny]] (born 1992) ice hockey player\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{dmoz|World/Deutsch/Regional/Europa/Deutschland/Bayern/Landkreise/Augsburg/St\u00e4dte_und_Gemeinden/Bobingen}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Augsburg (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Augsburg (district)]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobingen"}

The album pays tribute to late [[Music history of the United States in the 1970s|1970s]] and early [[Music history of the United States in the 1980s|1980s]] American music, particularly from [[Los Angeles]]. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements, and a [[web series]].\n\nFollowing the minimal production of their previous studio album, ''[[Human After All]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"GQ\" /> Daft Punk recruited [[session musician]]s to perform [[live instrumentation]] and limited the use of [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] to [[Drum machine|drum machines]], a custom-built [[modular synthesizer]], and vintage [[Vocoder|vocoders]]. The album features collaborations with [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]], [[Julian Casablancas]], [[Todd Edwards]], [[DJ Falcon]], [[Chilly Gonzales]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], [[Nathan East]], and [[Pharrell Williams]]. It is Daft Punk's first album released through Columbia Records.\n\n''Random Access Memories'' became Daft Punk's first album to top the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 339,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also topped the charts in over twenty-five countries. Its lead single \"[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]\" was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in over thirty countries and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling digital singles of all time]]. The album received critical acclaim, appearing on several year-end lists, and won in several categories at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronica Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]]. \"Get Lucky\" also won the awards for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nShortly after finishing their [[Alive 2006/2007]] tour, Daft Punk began working on new material in 2008, recording demos for approximately six months.

He recalled Daft Punk's visible joy in listening to the raw session recordings made early in the production of the album, as well as the impending years-long challenge that would be faced in completing the record. Gonzales expressed that the duo were aware of how the keys of each song would contribute to the emotional progression of the album as a whole. He therefore performed the piano in the song \"Within\" to accommodate the cycle.

He also added that their masks hide who they are from the public and allow the listeners to enjoy the music for what it is. Paul Williams worked with the duo at [[Henson Recording Studios]], the former studio of [[A&M Records]] where he had worked previously, including his compositions for [[Jim Henson]]'s films featuring [[the Muppets]], such as \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung from the point of view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed. He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote, as every day for him being sober has been wonderful compared to his prior life of excess.<ref name=collabrs7&8 /><ref name=collaborators8>{{cite web|last=Lachman|first=Ed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C683ACADxkw|title=Daft Punk &#124; ''Random Access Memories'' &#124; ''The Collaborators'', Episode 8: Paul Williams|date=10 May 2013|accessdate=10 May 2013|work=The Creators Project|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711041049/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C683ACADxkw|archivedate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Global album launch ===\nThe 79th Annual Wee Waa Show, held on 17 May 2013 in the rural Australian town of [[Wee Waa]], was selected as the venue for the worldwide album launch.<ref name=weewaa /> The tickets for the Wee Waa album launch were completely sold within thirteen minutes of release, even though it was widely understood that Daft Punk would not be in attendance at the launch\u2014the album launch details revealed that the album would be streamed live to the 4,000 audience members.

The album pays tribute to late [[Music history of the United States in the 1970s|1970s]] and early [[Music history of the United States in the 1980s|1980s]] American music, particularly from [[Los Angeles]]. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements, and a [[web series]].\n\nFollowing the minimal production of their previous studio album, ''[[Human After All]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"GQ\" /> Daft Punk recruited [[session musician]]s to perform [[live instrumentation]] and limited the use of [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] to [[Drum machine|drum machines]], a custom-built [[modular synthesizer]], and vintage [[Vocoder|vocoders]]. The album features collaborations with [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]], [[Julian Casablancas]], [[Todd Edwards]], [[DJ Falcon]], [[Chilly Gonzales]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], [[Nathan East]], and [[Pharrell Williams]]. It is Daft Punk's first album released through Columbia Records.\n\n''Random Access Memories'' became Daft Punk's first album to top the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 339,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also topped the charts in over twenty-five countries.

Paul Williams worked with the duo at [[Henson Recording Studios]], the former studio of [[A&M Records]] where he had worked previously, including his compositions for [[Jim Henson]]'s films featuring [[the Muppets]], such as \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung from the point of view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed.
