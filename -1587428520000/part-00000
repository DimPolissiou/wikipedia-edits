Using the power of the Pretty Cards and their changing forms, alongside Cure Honey and Cure Fortune, they form the Happiness Charge Pretty Cure team as they are given the task to collect all of the Pretty Cards and protect the Earth against the Phantom Empire.\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== HappinessCharge Pretty Cures ===\nThe Pretty Cures are legendary Warriors of Light who are chosen to protect the Earth from evil threats.

The two initially did not get on well during filming, as Yasamaru focused more on the suit's appearance than on its practicality, at one point making the character's hand-hooks out of pure [[fiberglass]], making lifting them almost impossible.<ref>''The Art of Suit Acting'' (2006) - Classic Media ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' DVD featurette</ref> In portraying Gigan, Satsuma deliberately emphasized the character's destructive personality. For Gigan's appearance in ''Zone Fighter'', Satsuma did not reprise the role.<ref>David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/satsum2.htm \"Kenpachiro Satsuma Interview I\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1993)</ref> Special effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] had initially wanted to give Gigan the ability to fire a laser beam from its forehead in homage to [[Buddhist art]] depicting the [[Buddha]] sporting a halo around his head, but the idea was scrapped, as Nakano felt that the character was already powerful enough. The beam was nevertheless included in some promotional stills, along with various Godzilla video games.<ref>David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/nakano.htm \"Teruyoshi Nakano Interview\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (July 1994)</ref>\nIn January 2019, director of the 2019 film ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'', [[Michael Dougherty]] expressed his interest in bringing back both Gigan and [[Biollante]] in future sequels of Legendary's [[MonsterVerse]] as he was quoted as saying \"I wanted to do it, but if I had the opportunity to do it again, I would have Biollante. Oh, and Gigan!\".\n\n===Characteristics===\nGigan, as a cyborg, possesses a [[circular saw]] in his abdomen and razor-sharp hooked blades in place of hands, which the monster uses to both batter and stab his opponents. According to ''[[Zone Fighter]]'', the tips of the hooks can also release an explosive charge on contact with an enemy (Gigan's hooks were replaced with double-bladed [[chainsaws]] after being initially defeated by Godzilla in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''). In addition, ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' and ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' also give Gigan an optically-mounted laser and the ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' version of his eye laser was named ''Giganume Cluster'' in ''[[Godzilla: The Game]]''. He was also equipped with [[jetpack]]s and [[grappling hooks]]. The Pipeworks trilogy gave Gigan the ability to teleport, as well. ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' also introduced Gigan's ability to shoot boomerang circular saw blades which were named ''Blooded Slicer'' in ''Godzilla: The Game''. However, his shuriken boomerang effect turned out to be a double-edged sword, as they unintentionally ended up killing him in the climax of the film. When Gigan was modified in ''Godzilla: Final Wars'', his hooks were replaced with two-pronged chainsaws, along with his head and neck being altered (now with longer horns and a reinforced neck piece).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997\u20131998)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] \u2013 1988)\n* ''[[Kaij\u016b-\u014d Godzilla]]'' / ''King of the Monsters, Godzilla'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' ([[Turbo Duo]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'' / ''Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters'' ([[Super Famicom]] \u2013 1994)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Giant Monster March|Godzilla Giant Monster March]]'' ([[Game Gear]] \u2013 1995)\n* ''[[Godzilla Trading Battle]]'' ([[PlayStation]] \u2013 1998)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' ([[Nintendo GameCube|GCN]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] \u2013 2002/2003)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' ([[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] \u2013 2004)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' ([[Wii]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 The Millennium version is exclusive in the [[Wii]] version.\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed#PlayStation 2 version|Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' (PS2 \u2013 2007) \u2013 The Showa version is exclusive to the [[PlayStation 2]] version.\n* ''Godzilla Defense Force'' (2019)\n\n===Literature===\n* ''[[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)#Godzilla at World's End|Godzilla at World's End]]'' (novel - 1998)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Legends]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Ongoing]]'' (comic - 2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: The Half-Century War]]'' (comic - 2012-2013)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Rulers of Earth]]'' (comic - 2013-2015)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Oblivion]]'' (comic - 2016)\n* ''GODZILLA: Project Mechagodzilla'' (novel - 2018)\n\n===Music===\n* Gigan (a.k.a.

Upon realizing that Gigan was regenerating, Godzilla used its atomic heat beam to completely annihilate Gigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://godzillareviews.wordpress.com/2019/02/22/anime-gigan/|title=Gigan In The Anime Universe|last=Brykczynski|first=Ben|work=Godzilla Movie Reviews|date=February 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nCreated during the early 1970s, when the Godzilla films had undergone a comic book-like shift both in tone and special effects, budgets were greatly reduced, so Gigan was designed as both a marketing ploy for children's toys and as a completely alien creature whose design would not have necessitated the same attention to detail needed for Godzilla's previously more animalistic opponents.<ref name=\"kalat2010\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=[[McFarland & Co.]]|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=115, 125|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nThe character was first conceived by [[Takeshi Kimura|Kaoru Mabuchi]] in his script ''Godzilla vs. the Space Monsters - Earth Defense Directive'', which contained elements that would later be incorporated into ''Godzilla vs. Gigan'', including having a mind-controlled Gigan being teamed up with [[King Ghidorah]], though the script also included [[Megalon]], and the mastermind behind the space monsters' actions was a living brain called Miko.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.176\">{{cite book |title=Japan\u2019s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/176 176] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/176 }}</ref>\n\nThe first Gigan suit was designed by illustrator Takayoshi Mizuki, modeled by suitmaker Noboyuki Yasamaru, and was worn by [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]]. The two initially did not get on well during filming, as Yasamaru focused more on the suit's appearance than on its practicality, at one point making the character's hand-hooks out of pure [[fiberglass]], making lifting them almost impossible.<ref>''The Art of Suit Acting'' (2006) - Classic Media ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' DVD featurette</ref> In portraying Gigan, Satsuma deliberately emphasized the character's destructive personality. For Gigan's appearance in ''Zone Fighter'', Satsuma did not reprise the role.<ref>David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/satsum2.htm \"Kenpachiro Satsuma Interview I\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1993)</ref> Special effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] had initially wanted to give Gigan the ability to fire a laser beam from its forehead in homage to [[Buddhist art]] depicting the [[Buddha]] sporting a halo around his head, but the idea was scrapped, as Nakano felt that the character was already powerful enough. The beam was nevertheless included in some promotional stills, along with various Godzilla video games.<ref>David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/nakano.htm \"Teruyoshi Nakano Interview\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (July 1994)</ref>\nIn January 2019, director of the 2019 film ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'', [[Michael Dougherty]] expressed his interest in bringing back both Gigan and [[Biollante]] in future sequels of Legendary's [[MonsterVerse]] as he was quoted as saying \"I wanted to do it, but if I had the opportunity to do it again, I would have Biollante. Oh, and Gigan!\".\n\n===Characteristics===\nGigan, as a cyborg, possesses a [[circular saw]] in his abdomen and razor-sharp hooked blades in place of hands, which the monster uses to both batter and stab his opponents. According to ''[[Zone Fighter]]'', the tips of the hooks can also release an explosive charge on contact with an enemy (Gigan's hooks were replaced with double-bladed [[chainsaws]] after being initially defeated by Godzilla in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''). In addition, ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' and ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' also give Gigan an optically-mounted laser and the ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' version of his eye laser was named ''Giganume Cluster'' in ''[[Godzilla: The Game]]''. He was also equipped with [[jetpack]]s and [[grappling hooks]]. The Pipeworks trilogy gave Gigan the ability to teleport, as well. ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' also introduced Gigan's ability to shoot boomerang circular saw blades which were named ''Blooded Slicer'' in ''Godzilla: The Game''. However, his shuriken boomerang effect turned out to be a double-edged sword, as they unintentionally ended up killing him in the climax of the film. When Gigan was modified in ''Godzilla: Final Wars'', his hooks were replaced with two-pronged chainsaws, along with his head and neck being altered (now with longer horns and a reinforced neck piece).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997\u20131998)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] \u2013 1988)\n* ''[[Kaij\u016b-\u014d Godzilla]]'' / ''King of the Monsters, Godzilla'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' ([[Turbo Duo]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'' / ''Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters'' ([[Super Famicom]] \u2013 1994)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Giant Monster March|Godzilla Giant Monster March]]'' ([[Game Gear]] \u2013 1995)\n* ''[[Godzilla Trading Battle]]'' ([[PlayStation]] \u2013 1998)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' ([[Nintendo GameCube|GCN]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] \u2013 2002/2003)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' ([[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] \u2013 2004)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' ([[Wii]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 The Millennium version is exclusive in the [[Wii]] version.\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed#PlayStation 2 version|Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' (PS2 \u2013 2007) \u2013 The Showa version is exclusive to the [[PlayStation 2]] version.\n* ''Godzilla Defense Force'' (2019)\n\n===Literature===\n* ''[[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)#Godzilla at World's End|Godzilla at World's End]]'' (novel - 1998)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Legends]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Ongoing]]'' (comic - 2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: The Half-Century War]]'' (comic - 2012-2013)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Rulers of Earth]]'' (comic - 2013-2015)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Oblivion]]'' (comic - 2016)\n* ''GODZILLA: Project Mechagodzilla'' (novel - 2018)\n\n===Music===\n* Gigan (a.k.a.

It seems that in the relatively early ''[[Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra]]'', for example, the ''bodhicitta'' is a much vaguer concept, more \"a certain state of mind\" in which a Bodhisattva acts (Nattier 2003a: 148). [...] Pagel points out that many Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, including the ''Bodhisattvapi\u1e6daka'', hold that the arising of ''bodhicitta'' (''bodhicittotp\u0101da'') is not simply a static thing that occurs just at the beginning of the Bodhisattva path. Rather it is continuously retaken and evolves through practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Williams (Buddhist studies scholar)|title=Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2008|page=355|ISBN=9781134250578}}</ref>}}\n\n===Late Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts===\nAmong the most important later [[source text]]s on bodhicitta, used by traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, are:\n\n* [[Shantideva|\u015a\u0101ntideva]]'s ''[[A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way Of Life]]'' (c. 700 CE),\n* Thogme Zangpo's ''Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/resources/37_practices_bodhisattva.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603034457/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/resources/37_practices_bodhisattva.html|title=The Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva|archivedate=June 3, 2004|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> (12th century CE),\n* [[Langri Tangpa]]'s ''Eight Verses for Training the Mind''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonmindfulness.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/EightVerses.pdf|title=Eight Verses for Training the Mind|publisher=[[Prison Mindfulness Institute]]|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> (c. 1100 CE), and\n* [[Geshe Chekhawa]] ''Training the Mind in Seven Points'' in the 12th century CE.\n\n==Practice==\nMahayana Buddhism propagates the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-ideal]], in which the [[Paramitas|Six perfections]] are being practiced. Arousing bodhicitta is part of this Bodhisattva-ideal.\n\n===Ideal===\nIn [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] and [[Vajray\u0101na]] Buddhism, the goal of Buddhist practice is primarily to be reborn infinite numbers of times to liberate all those other beings still trapped in sams\u0101ra.\n\n===P\u0101ramit\u0101-s===\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism teaches that the broader motivation of achieving one's own enlightenment \"in order to help all sentient beings\" is the best possible motivation one can have for any action, whether it be working in one's vocation, teaching others, or even making an incense offering. The Six Perfections ([[P\u0101ramit\u0101s]]) of Buddhism only become true \"perfections\" when they are done with the motivation of bodhicitta. Thus, the action of giving (Skt. [[d\u0101na]]) can be done in a mundane sense, or it can be a [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]] if it is conjoined with bodhicitta.

[...] Pagel points out that many Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, including the ''Bodhisattvapi\u1e6daka'', hold that the arising of ''bodhicitta'' (''bodhicittotp\u0101da'') is not simply a static thing that occurs just at the beginning of the Bodhisattva path.

The Six Perfections ([[P\u0101ramit\u0101s]]) of Buddhism only become true \"perfections\" when they are done with the motivation of bodhicitta. Thus, the action of giving (Skt. [[d\u0101na]]) can be done in a mundane sense, or it can be a [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]] if it is conjoined with bodhicitta.

The creation of CCLL was supported by the [[Galician People's Union]], that at the time tried to create a ''National-popular movement'' with sectoral organizations, like the [[Galician Workers Union]], [[ADEGA]] or CCLL itself. Due to the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]] the union was illegal, and its activities clandestine. In the winter of 1973 the official newspaper of CCLL, ''Fouce'' (Sickle), appeared. In 1974 and 1975 the union experienced a significant growth. The main struggles during those years were the recovery of the ''Montes Comunais'' (territories that traditionally were a common property of a [[Parroquia (Spain)|parroquia]] that were that had been nationalized by the state in the 19th and 20th centuries) and the struggle against the abusive payments to the [[Social security|Social Security network]]. CCLL also organized protests, rallies and [[boikot]]s against the construvtion of dams in the Galician rivers, that flooded entire [[Parroquia (Spain)|parroquias]].
