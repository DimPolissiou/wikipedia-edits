He was the son of an unnamed sister of his predecessor, [[Kaloyan]]. After Kaloyan died unexpectedly in October 1207, Boril married his widow, a [[Kumankata|Cuman princess]], to seize the throne. His cousin, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen]], fled from Bulgaria, enabling Boril to strengthen his position. His other kinsmen, [[Strez]] and [[Alexius Slav]],  refused to acknowledge him as the lawful monarch. Strez took possession of the land between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Vardar]] rivers with the support of [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia]]. Alexius Slav secured his rule in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] with the assistance of [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], the [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]].\n\nBoril launched unsuccessful military campaigns against the Latin Empire and the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] during the first years of his reign. He convoked the [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]] in early 1211. At the assembly, the bishops condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] for heresy. After an uprising broke out against him in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214, he sought assistance from [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], who sent reinforcements to suppress the riot. He made peace with the Latin Empire in late 1213 or early 1214. After Henry died in 1216 and Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary for a crusade, Ivan Asen returned to Bulgaria. He defeated Boril, who was captured and blinded in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in 1218.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBoril was the son of a sister of [[Peter II of Bulgaria|Peter&nbsp;II]], [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;I]] and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], who were emperors (or [[tsars]]) of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=53}} The etymology of his name is uncertain, because it may be connected either to the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''boriti'' (\"to fight\"), or to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] noun ''b\u00f6ri'' (\"wolf\").{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=177}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barbolova |first=Zoya |title=\u0422\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0438 ''[Turkic elements of the names of the tsars of the Asenid dynasty]'' |journal=\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 LiterNet |volume=3 |issue=196 |publisher=LiterNet |date=25 March 2016 |language=bg |url=https://liternet.bg/publish28/zoia-barbolova/asenevci.htm |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> Historian Alexandru Madgearu says most recorded variants of the name ''(Boril\u01d4, Burile, Borilus, Burillus)'' suggest that \"it was pronounced Boril\u01ce, as in Romanian\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nKaloyan died suddenly during the siege of [[Thessaloniki]] in October 1207.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=87}} Rumours started to spread claiming that the [[patron saint]] of the besieged town, [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], killed him.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} A version of these stories names one Manastras as the murderer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} The [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]], [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], stated in one of his letters that Boril \"had imposed his will by violence and usurped the imperial name and insignia\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=171}} Henri de Valenciennes (who continued the chronicle of [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] after 1207) likewise described Boril as a renegade who unlawfully seized the imperial crown.{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=5, 171}} According to Madgearu, both reports suggest that Boril had his uncle murdered, most probably in cooperation with [[Kumankata|Kaloyan's wife]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=170\u2013171}} Historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|John V.

Strez who had turned against Nemanji\u0107.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=183}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=96}}\n\nBoril convened a [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Church of his realm]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in early 1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}} The bishops confirmed the Orthodox confession adopted at the [[Feast of Orthodoxy|synod of Constantinople]] in 843 and condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], ordering their persecution as heretics.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} The synod established the [[date of Easter]] in accordance with the Catholic

1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}\n\nBoril sent an army to a mountain pass to prepare an ambush for the Latin Emperor Henry who was returning from Thessaloniki to Constantinople in April 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=98}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Having been informed of Boril's plan, Henry gathered his troops from the nearby Latin fortresses and forced Boril to withdraw his army.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Strez invaded the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but Michael of Epirus, who had made peace with the Latins, broke into his realm.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} Boril intervened in the conflict on Strez's behalf, but their united armies were defeated near [[Bitola]] in early summer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} He launched an assault on Thessaloniki in October, but [[Eustace of Flanders]], who administered the kingdom as regent, forced him to lift the siege with the assistance of Alexius Slav.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=186\u2013187}} Alexius Slav also captured Melnik.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}}\n\n=== Uprising ===\n\nFine says Boril held the Church synod to secure the support of the clergy for himself, because \"popular dissatisfaction with his reign may still have existed\" in 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} An uprising which broke out in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214 demonstrated the existence of popular discontent with him.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} The exact circumstances of the movement are uncertain, because the only source of information about these events are in fragmentary data preserved in a Hungarian royal charter issued in 1250.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} \n\nBoril was unable to suppress the rebellion without external assistance.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} He turned to [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], reminding him of \"their reliable friendship\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=58}} Andrew

and [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]] troops.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=58}} Joachim first routed three Cuman chieftains who tried to halt his invasion, then captured Vidin and handed

continued his journey towards [[Constantinople]], implying that his mediation contributed to the subsequent reconciliation between Boril and Henry.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril had already realised that he would be unable to regain the Thracian territories lost to the Latin Empire.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}} However, Henry wanted to resume the war against Theodore&nbsp;I Laskaris, to put an end to his conflict with Bulgaria.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} After lengthy negotiations, Henry married [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Boril's stepdaughter]] (whom modern historians wrongly call Maria) in late 1213 or early 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nIn early 1214, Boril proposed the hand of his daughter to Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary's son and heir, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=192}} Madgearu says he also renounced the lands that Andrew had claimed from Bulgaria (including [[Brani\u010devo (Golubac)|Brani\u010devo]]).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} Henry sent reinforcements to Boril who invaded Serbia and laid siege to [[Ni\u0161]] in 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}} Strez also invaded Serbia from the south, but he was killed during the campaign.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=103}} Conflicts between Boril and the Latin troops prevented them from capturing the town.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=104}}\n\n=== Fall ===\n\nThe Latin Emperor Henry died in July 1216; Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary to lead a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=194}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}} Being deprived of his two principal allies, Boril's position weakened, which enabled his cousin, Ivan Asen, to return to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=386}} Boril was defeated and forced to withdraw to Tarnovo.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} The Byzantine historian, [[George Akropolites]], stated that the siege lasted \"for seven years\",<ref name='George_Akropolites_ch20_p161'/> but he must have confused months for years, according to most historians.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} After Ivan Asen's troops entered the town, Boril tried to flee, but he was captured and blinded.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}}\n\n== Family ==\n\nAkropolites described Boril's first wife (the widow of his uncle) as a \"Scythian\" (or Cuman).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=147}} Boril's marriage to her violated canon law, but the Church did not protest against it.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}} [[Baldwin of Avesnes]], the ''Chronicle of Flanders'' and other Western European chronicles say that an unnamed niece of the Latin Emperor Henry (the daughter of his sister, [[Yolanda of Flanders]], and [[Peter&nbsp;II of Courtenay]]) was given in marriage to \"Johannis\", who is associated with Boril.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Historians who accept the reliability of this report{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} say that Boril married Henry's niece after their peace treaty in 1213 or 1214.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=61}} If this theory is valid, Boril's first wife either had died or had been sent to a monastery.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril's daughter was engaged to the Hungarian crown prince, B\u00e9la, in 1214, but the marriage never took

Alexius Slav secured his rule in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] with the assistance of [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], the [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]].\n\nBoril launched unsuccessful military campaigns against the Latin Empire and the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] during the first years of his reign. He convoked the [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]] in early 1211. At the assembly, the bishops condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] for heresy. After an uprising broke out against him in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214, he sought assistance from [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], who sent reinforcements to suppress the riot. He made peace with the Latin Empire in late 1213 or early 1214. After Henry died in 1216 and Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary for a crusade, Ivan Asen returned to Bulgaria. He defeated Boril, who was captured and blinded in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in 1218.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBoril was the son of a sister of [[Peter II of Bulgaria|Peter&nbsp;II]], [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;I]] and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], who were emperors (or [[tsars]]) of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=53}} The etymology of his name is uncertain, because it may be connected either to the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''boriti'' (\"to fight\"), or to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] noun ''b\u00f6ri'' (\"wolf\").{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=177}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barbolova |first=Zoya |title=\u0422\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0438 ''[Turkic elements of the names of the tsars of the Asenid dynasty]'' |journal=\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 LiterNet |volume=3 |issue=196 |publisher=LiterNet |date=25 March 2016 |language=bg |url=https://liternet.bg/publish28/zoia-barbolova/asenevci.htm |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> Historian Alexandru Madgearu says most recorded variants of the name ''(Boril\u01d4, Burile, Borilus, Burillus)'' suggest that \"it was pronounced Boril\u01ce, as in Romanian\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nKaloyan died suddenly during the siege of [[Thessaloniki]] in October 1207.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=87}} Rumours started to spread claiming that the [[patron saint]] of the besieged town, [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], killed him.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} A version of these stories names one Manastras as the murderer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} The [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]], [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], stated in one of his letters that Boril \"had imposed his will by violence and usurped the imperial name and insignia\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=171}} Henri de Valenciennes (who continued the chronicle of [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] after 1207) likewise described Boril as a renegade who unlawfully seized the imperial crown.{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=5, 171}} According to Madgearu, both reports suggest that Boril had his uncle murdered, most probably in cooperation with [[Kumankata|Kaloyan's wife]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=170\u2013171}} Historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|John V.

their lord in early 1209.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=97}} Henry intervened and made his own supporter the ruler of Serres.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=97}} Boril concluded an alliance with [[Theodore&nbsp;I Laskaris]],

Strez who had turned against Nemanji\u0107.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=183}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=96}}\n\nBoril convened a [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Church of his realm]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in early 1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}} The bishops confirmed the Orthodox confession adopted at the [[Feast of Orthodoxy|synod of Constantinople]] in 843 and condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], ordering their persecution as heretics.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} The synod established the [[date of Easter]] in accordance with the Catholic

1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}\n\nBoril sent an army to a mountain pass to prepare an ambush for the Latin Emperor Henry who was returning from Thessaloniki to Constantinople in April 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=98}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Having been informed of Boril's plan, Henry gathered his troops from the nearby Latin fortresses and forced Boril to withdraw his army.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Strez invaded the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but Michael of Epirus, who had made peace with the Latins, broke into his realm.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} Boril intervened in the conflict on Strez's behalf, but their united armies were defeated near [[Bitola]] in early summer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} He launched an assault on Thessaloniki in October, but [[Eustace of Flanders]], who administered the kingdom as regent, forced him to lift the siege with the assistance of Alexius Slav.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=186\u2013187}} Alexius Slav also captured Melnik.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}}\n\n=== Uprising ===\n\nFine says Boril held the Church synod to secure the support of the clergy for himself, because \"popular dissatisfaction with his reign may still have existed\" in 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} An uprising which broke out in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214 demonstrated the existence of popular discontent with him.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} The exact circumstances of the movement are uncertain, because the only source of information about these events are in fragmentary data preserved in a Hungarian royal charter issued in 1250.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} \n\nBoril was unable to suppress the rebellion without external assistance.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} He turned to [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], reminding him of \"their reliable friendship\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=58}} Andrew

continued his journey towards [[Constantinople]], implying that his mediation contributed to the subsequent reconciliation between Boril and Henry.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril had already realised that he would be unable to regain the Thracian territories lost to the Latin Empire.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}} However, Henry wanted to resume the war against Theodor&nbsp;I Laskaris, to put an end to his conflict with Bulgaria.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} After lengthy negotiations, Henry married [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Boril's stepdaughter]] (whom modern historians wrongly call Maria) in late 1213 or early 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nIn early 1214, Boril proposed the hand of his daughter to Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary's son and heir, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=192}} Madgearu says he also renounced the lands that Andrew had claimed from Bulgaria (including [[Brani\u010devo (Golubac)|Brani\u010devo]]).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} Henry sent reinforcements to Boril who invaded Serbia and laid siege to [[Ni\u0161]] in 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}} Strez also invaded Serbia from the south, but he was killed during the campaign.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=103}} Conflicts between Boril and the Latin troops prevented them from capturing the town.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=104}}\n\n=== Fall ===\n\nThe Latin Emperor Henry died in July 1216; Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary to lead a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=194}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}} Being deprived of his two principal allies, Boril's position weakened, which enabled his cousin, Ivan Asen, to return to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=386}} Boril was defeated and forced to withdraw to Tarnovo.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} The Byzantine historian, [[George Akropolites]], stated that the siege lasted \"for seven years\",<ref name='George_Akropolites_ch20_p161'/> but he must have confused months for years, according to most historians.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} After Ivan Asen's troops entered the town, Boril tried to flee, but he was captured and blinded.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}}\n\n== Family ==\n\nAkropolites described Boril's first wife (the widow of his uncle) as a \"Scythian\" (or Cuman).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=147}} Boril's marriage to her violated canon law, but the Church did not protest against it.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}} [[Baldwin of Avesnes]], the ''Chronicle of Flanders'' and other Western European chronicles say that an unnamed niece of the Latin Emperor Henry (the daughter of his sister, [[Yolanda of Flanders]], and [[Peter&nbsp;II of Courtenay]]) was given in marriage to \"Johannis\", who is associated with Boril.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Historians who accept the reliability of this report{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} say that Boril married Henry's niece after their peace treaty in 1213 or 1214.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=61}} If this theory is valid, Boril's first wife either had died or had been sent to a monastery.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril's daughter was engaged to the Hungarian crown prince, B\u00e9la, in 1214, but the marriage never took

Bush]] on October 3, 2008. It was a component of the government's measures in 2008 to address the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].\n\nThe TARP originally authorized expenditures of $700 billion. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] created the TARP. The [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law in 2010, reduced the amount authorized to $475 billion. By October 11, 2012, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) stated that total disbursements would be $431 billion, and estimated the total cost, including grants for mortgage programs that have not yet been made, would be $24 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43662 |title=CBO &#124; Report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program\u2014October 2012 |publisher=Cbo.gov |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the [[U.S. Treasury]] sold its remaining holdings of [[Ally Financial]], essentially ending the program.\n\n==Purpose==\nTARP allowed the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] to purchase or insure up to $700 billion of \"troubled assets,\" defined as \"(A) residential or commercial obligations will be bought, or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages, that in each case was originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008, the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial market stability; and (B) any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability, but only upon transmittal of such determination, in writing, to the appropriate committees of Congress\".<ref name=\"cbo.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9961&type=1 |title=CBO &#124; The Troubled Asset Relief Program: Report on Transactions Through December 31, 2008 |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn short, this allows the Treasury to purchase illiquid, difficult-to-value assets from banks and other financial institutions. The targeted assets can be [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, which were sold in a booming market until 2007, when they were hit by widespread [[foreclosure]]s on the underlying loans. TARP was intended to improve the liquidity of these assets by purchasing them using secondary market mechanisms, thus allowing participating institutions to stabilize their balance sheets and avoid further losses.\n\nTARP does not allow banks to recoup losses already incurred on troubled assets, but officials expect that once trading of these assets resumes, their prices will stabilize and ultimately increase in value, resulting in gains to both participating banks and the Treasury itself. The concept of future gains from troubled assets comes from the hypothesis in the financial industry that these assets are oversold, as only a small percentage of all mortgages are in default, while the relative fall in prices represents losses from a much higher default rate.\n\nThe [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA) requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure was designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110184334/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |title=Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother important goal of TARP was to encourage banks to resume lending again at levels seen before the crisis, both to each other and to consumers and businesses. If TARP can stabilize bank capital ratios, it should theoretically allow them to increase lending instead of hoarding cash to cushion against future unforeseen losses from troubled assets. Increased lending equates to \"loosening\" of credit, which the government hopes will restore order to the financial markets and improve investor confidence in financial institutions and the markets. As banks gain increased lending confidence, the interbank lending interest rates (the rates at which the banks lend to each other on a short term basis) should decrease, further facilitating lending.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nTARP will operate as a \"revolving purchase facility\". The Treasury will have a set spending limit, $250 billion at the start of the program, with which it will purchase the assets and then either sell them or hold the assets and collect the [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]]. The money received from sales and [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]] will go back into the pool, facilitating the purchase of more assets.

As with the other programs, the equity purchase program will be voluntary and designed with attractive terms to encourage participation from healthy institutions. It will also encourage firms to raise new private capital to complement public capital.\n#Homeownership preservation: When we purchase mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, we will look for every opportunity possible to help homeowners.

To receive capital under the program banks are also \"required to provide a specific business plan for the next two or three years and explain how they plan to deploy the capital\".<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Eligible assets and asset valuation==\nTARP allowed the Treasury to purchase both \"troubled assets\" and any other asset the purchase of which the Treasury determined was \"necessary\" to further economic stability. Troubled assets included real estate and mortgage-related assets and securities based on those assets. This included both the mortgages themselves and the various financial instruments created by pooling groups of mortgages into one security to be bought on the market. This category probably included foreclosed properties as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nReal estate and mortgage-related assets (and securities based on those kinds of assets) were eligible if they originated (that is, were created) or were issued on or before March 14, 2008, the date of the Bear Stearns bailout.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOne of the more difficult issues that the Treasury faced in managing TARP was the pricing of the troubled assets. The Treasury had to find a way to price extremely complex and sometimes unwieldy instruments for which a market did not exist. In addition, the pricing had to strike a balance between efficiently using public funds provided by the government and providing adequate assistance to the financial institutions that need it.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe Act encouraged the Treasury to design a program using market mechanisms to the extent possible. This had led to the expectation that the Treasury would use a [[reverse auction]] to price assets. Theoretically, the system would create a market price from bidders that would want to sell at the highest possible price, but also be able to make a sale, therefore the price must set a low enough price to be competitive. The Treasury was required to publish its methods for pricing, purchasing, and valuing troubled assets no later than two days after the purchase of their first asset.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) used procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) to value assets purchased under the TARP.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\"/>\n\nIn a report dated February 6, 2009, the Congressional Oversight Panel concluded that the Treasury paid substantially more for the assets it purchased under the TARP than their then-current market value. The COP found the Treasury paid $254 billion, for which it received assets worth approximately $176 billion, for a shortfall of $78 billion. The COP's valuation analysis assumed that \"securities similar to those issued under the TARP were trading in the capital markets at fair values\" and employed multiple approaches to cross-check and validate the results. The value was estimated for each security as of the time immediately following the announcement by Treasury of its purchase. For example, the COP found that the Treasury bought $25 billion of assets from Citigroup on October 14, 2008, however, the actual value was estimated to be $15.5, creating a 38 percent (or $9.5 billion) subsidy.<ref name=\"cop.senate.gov\"/>\n\n==Protection of government investment==\n#'''Equity stakes'''\n##The Act requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure is designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Limits on executive compensation'''\n##The Act sets some limits on the compensation of the five highest-paid executives at companies that elect to participate significantly in TARP. The Act treats companies that participate through the auction process differently from those that participate through direct sale (that is, without a bidding process).\n###'''Companies who sell more than $300 million in assets through an auction process''' are prohibited from signing new \"golden parachute\" contracts (employment contracts that provide for large payments upon termination) with any future executives. It will also place a $500,000 limit on annual tax deductions for payment of each executive, as well as a deduction limit on severance benefits for any golden parachutes already in place.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n###'''Companies in which the Treasury acquires equity because of direct purchases''' must meet tougher standards to be established by the Treasury. These standards will require the companies to eliminate compensation structures that encourage \"unnecessary and excessive\" risk-taking by executives, provide for claw-back (forced repayment of bonuses in the event of a post-payment determination that the bonuses were paid on the basis of false data) of bonuses already paid to senior executives based on financial statements later proven to be inaccurate, and prohibit payment of previously established golden parachutes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Recoupment'''\n##This provision was a big factor in the eventual passage of the EESA. It gives the government the opportunity to \"be repaid\". The recoupment provision requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit a report on TARP's financial status to Congress five years after its enactment. If TARP has not been able to recoup its outlays through the sale of the assets, the Act requires the President to submit a plan to Congress to recoup the losses from the financial industry. Theoretically, this prevents TARP from adding to the national debt. The use of the term \"financial industry\" in the provision leaves open the possibility that such a plan would involve the entire financial sector rather than only those institutions that availed themselves of TARP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Disclosure and Transparency'''\n##Though the Treasury will ultimately determine the type and extent of disclosure required for participation in the TARP, it is clear that these requirements will be extensive, particularly with respect to any asset acquired by TARP. It seems certain that institutions who participate in TARP will have to publicly disclose information pertaining to their participation, including the number of assets they sold to TARP, what type of assets were sold, and at what price. More extensive disclosure may be required at the discretion of the Treasury.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n##The Act also seems to give a broad mandate to the Treasury to determine, for each \"type\" of institution that sells assets to TARP, whether the current disclosure and transparency requirements on the sources of the institution's exposure (such as off-balance sheet transactions, derivative instruments, and contingent liabilities) are adequate. If the Treasury finds that a particular institution has not provided sufficient disclosures, it has the power to make recommendations for new disclosure requirements to the institution's regulators, which will probably include foreign-government regulators for those foreign financial institutions that have \"significant operations\" in the United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Judicial Review of Treasury Actions'''\n##The Act provides for judicial review of the actions taken by the Treasury under the EESA. In other words, the Treasury may be taken to court for actions it takes pursuant to the Act. Specifically, Treasury actions may be held unlawful if they involve an abuse of discretion, or are found to be \"arbitrary, capricious . . . or not in accordance with law\". However, a financial institution that sells assets to TARP is cannot challenge the Treasury's actions with respect to that institution's specific participation in TARP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== Expenditures and commitments ==\n{{As of|2012|June|30|df=US}}, $467 billion had been allotted, and $416 billion spent, according to a literature review on the TARP.<ref>Wilson, Linus, TARP (October 19, 2012).

Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2164559</ref> Among the money committed, includes:\n\n* $204.9 billion to purchase bank equity shares through the [[Capital Purchase Program]]\n* $67.8 billion to purchase preferred shares of [[American International Group]] (AIG), then among the top 10 US companies, through the program for Systemically Significant Failing Institutions;\n* $1.4 billion to back any losses that the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] might incur under the [[Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility]];\n* $40 billion in stock purchases of Citigroup and Bank of America ($20 billion each) through the Targeted Investment Program ($40 billion spent).  All that money had been returned.\n* $5 billion in loan guarantees for Citigroup ($5 billion). The program closed, with no payment made, on December 23, 2009.\n* $79.7 billion in loans and capital injections to automakers and their financing arms through the Automotive Industry Financing Program.\n* $21.9 billion to buy \"toxic\" mortgage-related securities.\n* $0.6 billion in capital for banks in [[Community Development Capital Initiative]] (CDCI) for banks serving disadvantaged communities.\n* $45.6 billion for homeowner foreclosure assistance. Only $4.5 billion had been spent at the time.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office released a report in January 2009, reviewing the transactions enacted through the TARP. The CBO found that through December 31, 2008, transactions under the TARP totaled $247 billion. According to the CBO's report, the Treasury had purchased $178 billion in shares of preferred stock and warrants from 214 U.S. financial institutions through its Capital Purchase Program (CPP). This included the purchase of $40 billion of preferred stock in AIG, $25 billion of preferred stock in Citigroup, and $15 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America. The Treasury also agreed to lend $18.4 billion to General Motors and Chrysler. The Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve have also agreed to guarantee a $306 billion portfolio of assets owned by Citigroup.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\" />\n\nThe CBO also estimated the subsidy cost for transactions under TARP. The subsidy cost is defined as, broadly speaking, the difference between what the Treasury paid for the investments or lent to the firms and the market value of those transactions, where the assets in question were valued using procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA), but adjusting for market risk as specified in the EESA.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\" /> The CBO estimated that the subsidy cost of the $247 billion in transactions before December 31, 2008 amounts to $64 billion. As of August 31, 2015, TARP is projected to cost approximately $37.3 billion total\u2014significantly less than the $700 billion originally authorized by Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/about-tarp/Pages/default.aspx|title=About TARP|author=|date=|website=www.treasury.gov|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe May 2015 report of the TARP to Congress stated that $427.1 billion had been disbursed, total proceeds by April 30, 2015 were $441.8 billion, exceeding disbursements by $14.1 billion, though this included $17.7 billion in non-TARP AIG shares. The report predicted a total net cash outflow of $37.7 billion (excluding non-TARP AIG shares), based on the assumption the TARP housing programs' ([[Hardest Hit Fund]], [[Making Home Affordable]] and FHA refinancing) funds are fully taken up.

Bush]] on October 3, 2008. It was a component of the government's measures in 2008 to address the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].\n\nThe TARP originally authorized expenditures of $700 billion. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] created the TARP. The [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law in 2010, reduced the amount authorized to $475 billion. By October 11, 2012, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) stated that total disbursements would be $431 billion, and estimated the total cost, including grants for mortgage programs that have not yet been made, would be $24 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43662 |title=CBO &#124; Report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program\u2014October 2012 |publisher=Cbo.gov |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the [[U.S. Treasury]] sold its remaining holdings of [[Ally Financial]], essentially ending the program.\n\n==Purpose==\nTARP allowed the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] to purchase or insure up to $700 billion of \"troubled assets,\" defined as \"(A) residential or commercial obligations will be bought, or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages, that in each case was originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008, the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial market stability; and (B) any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability, but only upon transmittal of such determination, in writing, to the appropriate committees of Congress\".<ref name=\"cbo.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9961&type=1 |title=CBO &#124; The Troubled Asset Relief Program: Report on Transactions Through December 31, 2008 |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn short, this allows the Treasury to purchase illiquid, difficult-to-value assets from banks and other financial institutions. The targeted assets can be [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, which were sold in a booming market until 2007, when they were hit by widespread [[foreclosure]]s on the underlying loans. TARP was intended to improve the liquidity of these assets by purchasing them using secondary market mechanisms, thus allowing participating institutions to stabilize their balance sheets and avoid further losses.\n\nTARP does not allow banks to recoup losses already incurred on troubled assets, but officials expect that once trading of these assets resumes, their prices will stabilize and ultimately increase in value, resulting in gains to both participating banks and the Treasury itself. The concept of future gains from troubled assets comes from the hypothesis in the financial industry that these assets are oversold, as only a small percentage of all mortgages are in default, while the relative fall in prices represents losses from a much higher default rate.\n\nThe [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA) requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure was designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110184334/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |title=Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother important goal of TARP was to encourage banks to resume lending again at levels seen before the crisis, both to each other and to consumers and businesses. If TARP can stabilize bank capital ratios, it should theoretically allow them to increase lending instead of hoarding cash to cushion against future unforeseen losses from troubled assets. Increased lending equates to \"loosening\" of credit, which the government hopes will restore order to the financial markets and improve investor confidence in financial institutions and the markets. As banks gain increased lending confidence, the interbank lending interest rates (the rates at which the banks lend to each other on a short term basis) should decrease, further facilitating lending.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nTARP will operate as a \"revolving purchase facility\". The Treasury will have a set spending limit, $250 billion at the start of the program, with which it will purchase the assets and then either sell them or hold the assets and collect the [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]]. The money received from sales and [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]] will go back into the pool, facilitating the purchase of more assets. The initial $250 billion could be increased to $350 billion upon the [[President of the United States|president]]'s certification to [[United States Congress|Congress]] that such an increase was necessary.<ref name= 'Senate-EESA-Summary'>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20081004201320/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/latestversionEESASummary.pdf Summary of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008] United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.

Here, we are designing the detailed auction protocols and will work with vendors to implement the program.\n#Whole loan purchase program: Regional banks are particularly clogged with whole residential mortgage loans. This team is working with bank regulators to identify which types of loans to purchase first, how to value them, and which purchase mechanism will best meet our policy objectives.\n#Insurance program: We are establishing a program to insure troubled assets. We have several innovative ideas on how to structure this program, including how to insure mortgage-backed securities as well as whole loans. At the same time, we recognize that there are likely other good ideas out there that we could benefit from. Accordingly, on Friday we submitted to the Federal Register a public Request for Comment to solicit the best ideas on structuring options. We are requiring responses within fourteen days so we can consider them quickly, and begin designing the program.\n#[[Stock|Equity]] purchase program: We are designing a standardized program to purchase equity in a broad array of financial institutions. As with the other programs, the equity purchase program will be voluntary and designed with attractive terms to encourage participation from healthy institutions. It will also encourage firms to raise new private capital to complement public capital.\n#Homeownership preservation: When we purchase mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, we will look for every opportunity possible to help homeowners. This goal is consistent with other programs \u2013 such as HOPE NOW \u2013 aimed at working with borrowers, counselors and servicers to keep people in their homes. In this case, we are working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to maximize these opportunities to help as many homeowners as possible, while also protecting the government.\n#[[Executive compensation]]: The law sets out important requirements regarding executive compensation for firms that participate in the TARP. This team is working hard to define the requirements for financial institutions to participate in three possible scenarios: One, an auction purchase of troubled assets; two, a broad equity or direct purchase program; and three, a case of an intervention to prevent the impending failure of a systemically significant institution.\n#[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]]: The law establishes important oversight and compliance structures, including establishing an Oversight Board, on-site participation of the General Accounting Office and the creation of a Special Inspector General, with thorough reporting requirements.</blockquote>\n\n[[Eric Thorson]] was the [[Inspector General]] of the [[US Department of the Treasury]] and was responsible for the oversight of the TARP but expressed concerns about the difficulty of properly overseeing the complex program in addition to his regular responsibilities. Thorson called oversight of TARP a \"mess\" and later clarified this to say \"The word 'mess' was a description of the difficulty my office would have in providing the proper level of oversight of the TARP while handling its growing workload, including conducting audits of certain failed banks and thrifts at the same time that efforts are underway to nominate a special inspector general.\"<ref>Eric Thorson.

The Treasury would need to define what institutions will be included under the term \"financial institution\" and what will constitute \"significant operations\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Companies that sell their bad assets to the government must have provided [[Warrant (finance)|warrant]]s so that the government would benefit from future growth of the companies.<ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/> Certain institutions seemed to be guaranteed participation. These included: U.S. banks, U.S. branches of a foreign bank, U.S. savings banks or credit unions, U.S. broker-dealers, U.S. insurance companies, U.S. mutual funds or other U.S. registered investment companies, tax-qualified U.S. employee retirement plans, and bank holding companies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe President was to submit a law to cover government losses on the fund, using \"a small, broad-based fee on all financial institutions\".<ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/> To participate in the bailout program, \"...companies will lose certain tax benefits and, in some cases, must limit [[executive pay]].

It was being used to classify the nation's 8,500 banks into five categories, where a ranking of 1 means they are most likely to be helped and a 5 most likely to not be helped.

[... Banks] that have been profitable over the last year are the most likely to receive capital. Banks that have lost money over the last year, however, must pass additional tests. [...] They are also asking if a bank has enough capital and reserves to withstand severe losses to its construction loan portfolio, nonperforming loans and other troubled assets.\"<ref name=NYT/> Some banks received capital with the understanding the banks would try to find a merger partner. To receive capital under the program banks are also \"required to provide a specific business plan for the next two or three years and explain how they plan to deploy the capital\".<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Eligible assets and asset valuation==\nTARP allowed the Treasury to purchase both \"troubled assets\" and any other asset the purchase of which the Treasury determined was \"necessary\" to further economic stability. Troubled assets included real estate and mortgage-related assets and securities based on those assets. This included both the mortgages themselves and the various financial instruments created by pooling groups of mortgages into one security to be bought on the market. This category probably included foreclosed properties as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nReal estate and mortgage-related assets (and securities based on those kinds of assets) were eligible if they originated (that is, were created) or were issued on or before March 14, 2008, the date of the Bear Stearns bailout.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOne of the more difficult issues that the Treasury faced in managing TARP was the pricing of the troubled assets. The Treasury had to find a way to price extremely complex and sometimes unwieldy instruments for which a market did not exist. In addition, the pricing had to strike a balance between efficiently using public funds provided by the government and providing adequate assistance to the financial institutions that need it.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe Act encouraged the Treasury to design a program using market mechanisms to the extent possible. This had led to the expectation that the Treasury would use a [[reverse auction]] to price assets. Theoretically, the system would create a market price from bidders that would want to sell at the highest possible price, but also be able to make a sale, therefore the price must set a low enough price to be competitive. The Treasury was required to publish its methods for pricing, purchasing, and valuing troubled assets no later than two days after the purchase of their first asset.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) used procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) to value assets purchased under the TARP.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\"/>\n\nIn a report dated February 6, 2009, the Congressional Oversight Panel concluded that the Treasury paid substantially more for the assets it purchased under the TARP than their then-current market value. The COP found the Treasury paid $254 billion, for which it received assets worth approximately $176 billion, for a shortfall of $78 billion. The COP's valuation analysis assumed that \"securities similar to those issued under the TARP were trading in the capital markets at fair values\" and employed multiple approaches to cross-check and validate the results. The value was estimated for each security as of the time immediately following the announcement by Treasury of its purchase. For example, the COP found that the Treasury bought $25 billion of assets from Citigroup on October 14, 2008, however, the actual value was estimated to be $15.5, creating a 38 percent (or $9.5 billion) subsidy.<ref name=\"cop.senate.gov\"/>\n\n==Protection of government investment==\n#'''Equity stakes'''\n##The Act requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure is designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Limits on executive compensation'''\n##The Act sets some limits on the compensation of the five highest-paid executives at companies that elect to participate significantly in TARP. The Act treats companies that participate through the auction process differently from those that participate through direct sale (that is, without a bidding process).\n###'''Companies who sell more than $300 million in assets through an auction process''' are prohibited from signing new \"golden parachute\" contracts (employment contracts that provide for large payments upon termination) with any future executives. It will also place a $500,000 limit on annual tax deductions for payment of each executive, as well as a deduction limit on severance benefits for any golden parachutes already in place.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n###'''Companies in which the Treasury acquires equity because of direct purchases''' must meet tougher standards to be established by the Treasury. These standards will require the companies to eliminate compensation structures that encourage \"unnecessary and excessive\" risk-taking by executives, provide for claw-back (forced repayment of bonuses in the event of a post-payment determination that the bonuses were paid on the basis of false data) of bonuses already paid to senior executives based on financial statements later proven to be inaccurate, and prohibit payment of previously established golden parachutes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Recoupment'''\n##This provision was a big factor in the eventual passage of the EESA. It gives the government the opportunity to \"be repaid\". The recoupment provision requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit a report on TARP's financial status to Congress five years after its enactment. If TARP has not been able to recoup its outlays through the sale of the assets, the Act requires the President to submit a plan to Congress to recoup the losses from the financial industry. Theoretically, this prevents TARP from adding to the national debt. The use of the term \"financial industry\" in the provision leaves open the possibility that such a plan would involve the entire financial sector rather than only those institutions that availed themselves of TARP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Disclosure and Transparency'''\n##Though the Treasury will ultimately determine the type and extent of disclosure required for participation in the TARP, it is clear that these requirements will be extensive, particularly with respect to any asset acquired by TARP. It seems certain that institutions who participate in TARP will have to publicly disclose information pertaining to their participation, including the number of assets they sold to TARP, what type of assets were sold, and at what price. More extensive disclosure may be required at the discretion of the Treasury.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n##The Act also seems to give a broad mandate to the Treasury to determine, for each \"type\" of institution that sells assets to TARP, whether the current disclosure and transparency requirements on the sources of the institution's exposure (such as off-balance sheet transactions, derivative instruments, and contingent liabilities) are adequate. If the Treasury finds that a particular institution has not provided sufficient disclosures, it has the power to make recommendations for new disclosure requirements to the institution's regulators, which will probably include foreign-government regulators for those foreign financial institutions that have \"significant operations\" in the United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n#'''Judicial Review of Treasury Actions'''\n##The Act provides for judicial review of the actions taken by the Treasury under the EESA. In other words, the Treasury may be taken to court for actions it takes pursuant to the Act. Specifically, Treasury actions may be held unlawful if they involve an abuse of discretion, or are found to be \"arbitrary, capricious . . . or not in accordance with law\". However, a financial institution that sells assets to TARP is cannot challenge the Treasury's actions with respect to that institution's specific participation in TARP.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== Expenditures and commitments ==\n{{As of|2012|June|30|df=US}}, $467 billion had been allotted, and $416 billion spent, according to a literature review on the TARP.<ref>Wilson, Linus, TARP (October 19, 2012).

Only $4.5 billion had been spent at the time.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office released a report in January 2009, reviewing the transactions enacted through the TARP. The CBO found that through December 31, 2008, transactions under the TARP totaled $247 billion. According to the CBO's report, the Treasury had purchased $178 billion in shares of preferred stock and warrants from 214 U.S. financial institutions through its Capital Purchase Program (CPP). This included the purchase of $40 billion of preferred stock in AIG, $25 billion of preferred stock in Citigroup, and $15 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America. The Treasury also agreed to lend $18.4 billion to General Motors and Chrysler. The Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve have also agreed to guarantee a $306 billion portfolio of assets owned by Citigroup.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\" />\n\nThe CBO also estimated the subsidy cost for transactions under TARP. The subsidy cost is defined as, broadly speaking, the difference between what the Treasury paid for the investments or lent to the firms and the market value of those transactions, where the assets in question were valued using procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA), but adjusting for market risk as specified in the EESA.<ref name=\"cbo.gov\" /> The CBO estimated that the subsidy cost of the $247 billion in transactions before December 31, 2008 amounts to $64 billion.
