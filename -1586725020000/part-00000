On March 16, in the midst of break, production of the show was temporarily suspended. The suspension impacted three previously announced episodes: March 28, April 4, and April 11. The host and musical guest for the March 28 episode had been previously announced as [[John Krasinski]] and [[Dua Lipa]] respectively. The episode would have been Krasinski's first hosting appearance and Lipa's second musical guest appearance since [[Saturday Night Live (season 43)|2018]].<ref name=\"stop\" /> The March 28 and April 4 episodes were  replaced by reruns.

In fact, this version of the show seems constitutionally preordained to settle precisely in the middle, no matter how long ''SNL'' eventually runs.

Thus, Milner spent nearly four years traveling the U.S. for the series, sometimes taking his wife and children along.<ref name=\"LAT\"/>\n\nMilner appeared on Broadway once in the short-lived comedy ''The Ninety Day Mistress'' in 1967.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/arts/television/martin-milner-dies-at-83-actor-made-his-name-on-route-66.html?_r=0|title=Martin Milner, Clean-Cut Star of 'Route 66' and 'Adam-12,' Dies at 83|first=Anita|last=Gates|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 7, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Adam-12''===\nMilner and Webb had a long-established working relationship by the time it came to cast ''Adam-12''. Milner appeared in numerous episodes of both the radio and television versions of the series ''Dragnet''. Milner also worked with Webb in the films ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]'' (1950) and ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]'' (1955).\n\nIn 1968, Milner returned to television as seven-year [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] veteran uniform patrol Officer Peter Joseph \"Pete\" Malloy in ''[[Adam-12]]'', the Webb-produced police drama. [[Kent McCord]] played his partner, rookie Officer James A. \"Jim\" Reed. The series ran from 1968 to 1975. Like Webb's ''Dragnet'', it was based on real Los Angeles Police Department procedures and cases.\n\nMilner was Webb's choice for Pete Malloy in part because his relative youth and prior acting credits and because of his on-camera driving experience from his days on ''Route 66''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prime-time hits: television's most popular network program| first=Susan|last=Sackett|year=1993|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|isbn=978-0823083923|page=}}</ref> He guest-starred in three episodes of ''[[Emergency!]]'' between 1972 and 1976, during and after ''Adam-12''{{'}}s run on NBC, the best known and first of which was the pilot episode ''[[The Wedsworth-Townsend Act]]''.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Martin Milner 1975.JPG|thumb|Milner in ''The Swiss Family Robinson'' in 1975]]\nAfter ''Adam-12'', Milner starred as Karl Robinson in a television series version of ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson (1975 TV series)|The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1975\u20131976), produced by [[Irwin Allen]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Most of his following work was as a television guest star, including action-adventure series ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' (as James MacGyver, MacGyver's father), ''[[Airwolf]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[RoboCop: The Series]]''. In 1983, Milner hosted a morning radio wake-up show on AM 600 [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]] in San Diego.\n\nMilner also portrayed the victim in the premiere episode of ''[[Columbo]]'' titled \"Murder by the Book\". In 1990, Milner teamed again with Kent McCord in the cable TV-movie ''Nashville Beat'' (1990), originally shown on the now-defunct [[The Nashville Network]]. The story, partly written by McCord, had McCord as an LAPD detective who teams with his old partner, Milner, in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1992, he guest-starred on five episodes of ABC's ''[[Life Goes On (TV series)|Life Goes On]]''. After retiring from acting, Milner co-hosted a radio show about fishing called \"Let's Talk Hook-Up\" on San Diego-area sports station [[XEWW-AM|XETRA]] AM 690 (now XEWW).<ref name=\"LAT\"/> In 1998, Milner decided to pay an homage of sorts to ''Route 66'', with the documentary film '' Route 66: Return to the Road with Martin Milner'', which featured Milner in a 1961 Corvette on a journey from Chicago to Santa Monica on the highway.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nIn May 1956, Milner met singer and actress Judith Bess Jones<ref name=\"Dagan\"/> at a Hollywood dinner party.
