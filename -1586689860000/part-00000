Wartski firstly established a jewellery business on Bangor's High Street and then a drapery store. His son, Isidore, went on to develop the drapery business and to create a large, fashionable, store. He also developed the Castle Inn on High Street in Bangor, into the high-class Castle Hotel. He was a popular mayor of the city and a patron of local sports and charities. Wartski Fields were bequeathed to the city and people of Bangor by his widow, Winifred Marie, in memory of Isidore Wartski.\n\nAnother of Morris's sons went on to develop the jewellery part of the business into an international player. Morris Wartski's two sons, Harry and Charles, went into the business but when Charles was injured in a cycling accident, the business was moved in 1907 to the seaside town of [[Llandudno]] for the sake of his health.  The [[Marquess of Anglesey]] was the best customer and [[David Lloyd George]] was engaged as the firm's lawyer. When Charles died in 1914, Harry ran the business with his father Morris and two brothers-in-law S. M. Benjamin and [[Emanuel Snowman]].  \n\nAfter the death of Morris Wartski and Benjamin, Harry was joined in the business in Llandudno by his son, Charles Wartski, and a nephew, Cecil Manson.  A second jewellery and antique establishment was opened in Mostyn street, Llandudno. So fond of Llandudno was Harry Wartski that when the firm opened a branch in London's New Bond Street in 1911, it was given the name of Wartski of Llandudno. \n\nThe firm moved via premises in the Quadrant Arcade, Regent Street and 139 Regent Street to its current location at 14 Grafton Street, [[Mayfair]]. The firm's distinctive shop-front on Grafton Street, designed by [[John Bruckland]] in 1974, was [[Grade II listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in 2012.<ref name=EH>{{cite web|title=Shop Front to Wartski, 14 Grafton Street, London, W1S 4DE|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1410175|work=English Heritage|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> It is a rare survival of innovative twentieth century retail architecture in Mayfair.\n\nWith the Russian revolution, many of the aristocracy took with them large quantities of jewellery made by Carl Faberg\u00e9, jeweller to the Tsar.  The pieces found their way into shops all over Europe.  Harry Wartski painstakingly tracked them down and bought them for his shop.  He and Snowman also bought some pieces from the Soviet government, whose collection attracted Royal patronage to the firm.  Emanuel Snowman travelled to the [[USSR]] from 1925 onwards to negotiate the purchase of former [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] jewels and ''[[objets d'art]]'' from the ''Antiquariat'', a commissariat established by the Bolsheviks to raise foreign currency.  \n\nWhen [[King Farouk]] was deposed, Kenneth Snowman (Emmanuel Snowman's son) went to [[Cairo]] to buy up some of the Egyptian crown jewels which also included many Faberg\u00e9 pieces. \n[[File:Wartski 3171.JPG|thumb|Wartski on 14 Grafton Street, London (2011)]]\n[[Kenneth Snowman|(Abraham) Kenneth Snowman]] (1919\u20132002), ran the London shop and wrote standard works, ''The Art of Carl Faberg\u00e9'' (1953), followed by ''Carl Faberg\u00e9: Goldsmith to the Imperial Court of Russia'' and ''Eighteenth Century Gold Boxes of Europe'' (1966), written at the urging of [[Sacheverell Sitwell]].  As a curator, Snowman organised the exhibitions of Faberg\u00e9 at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (1977) and at the [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]], New York (1983).

Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.<ref name=\"partnerplatform\"

that in most industrial countries foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices ranged from simple legalization, through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extreme cases as in Germany, where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.\nThe German Parliamentary Financial Commission rejected a Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition, which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA from 1977), thus fostering national export corporations.<ref>[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] \"Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD

(Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).<ref name=study />\n\nBelgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\"\n\n====\"Specific\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====\nReferring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991\u20131994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term \"official\" had been limited to German jurisdiction.

[[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers \"shelter behind a wall\" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.\n\n''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''\n\nThe [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2|\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \"unspotted from the world.\"<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably \"deal with the world,\"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of \"as if not\" in all their dealings.

Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.\n\nIn 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption.

There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity.

(Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).<ref name=study />\n\nBelgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\"\n\n====\"Specific\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====\nReferring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991\u20131994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term \"official\" had been limited to German jurisdiction.

Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others.

He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''\n\nThe [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2|\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \"unspotted from the world.\"<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably \"deal with the world,\"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of \"as if not\" in all their dealings.

The tankia came from some of the Miaotsz' tribes so early that their origin is unknown.1  The modern classifications of the people, recognized, however, more by law than custom, are various and comprehensive. First, natives and aliens; the latter include the unsubdued mountaineers and aboriginal tribes living in various parts, races of boat-people on the coasts, and all foreigners residing within the Empire, each of whom are subject to particular laws. Second, conquerors and conquered; having reference almost entirely to a prohibition of intermarriages between Manchus and Chinese. Third, freemen and slaves; every native is allowed to purchase slaves and retain their children in servitude, and free persons sometimes forfeit their freedom on account of their crimes, or mortgage themselves into bondage. Fourth, the honorable and the mean, who cannot intermarry without the former forfeiting their privileges; the latter comprise, besides aliens and slaves, criminals, executioners, police-runners, actors, jugglers, beggars, and all other vagrant or vile persons, who are in general required to pursue for three generations some honorable and useful employment before they are eligible to enter the literary examinations. These four divisions extend over the whole body of the people, but really affect only a small minority.  It is worthy of note how few have been the slaves in China, and how easy has been their condition in comparison with what' it was in Greece and Rome. Owing chiefly to the prevalence of education in the liberal principles of the Four Books, China has been saved from this disintegrating element. The proportion of slaves to freemen cannot be stated, but the former have never attracted notice by their numbers nor excited dread by their restiveness.

Mohammedan temple. The head priest is a man of a remarkably benign and intelligent countenance. His air is very gentlemanly. He must be 45 years of age. His figure is slender but tall. His native place is in Shantung, but his ancestors came from Medina in Arabia. He himself can read the Arabic scriptures most readily, and talks that language fluently; but of Chinese writing and reading, he is as ignorant as an Englishman in England. This is very surprising, considering that he can talk it so well, was born and educated in China, and is a minister of religion among the Chinese. He laments much that his supporters are so few ;\u2014they do not number more than twenty or thirty families. He took me into the place of worship, which adjoins his apartments. On ascending a flight of steps, you get under a plain roof, beneath which, on either side, you find a mass of old furniture and agricultural implements covered with dust. The pillars to support the roof are ornamented with sentences out of the Koran.* Facing you is an ornamented pair of small doors hung upon the wall, within which the sacred seat is supposed to lie; and on one side is a convenient book-case that contains the Mohammedan scriptures in 24 parts. He showed me his usual officiating dress, which is simply a white robe with a pointed turban. Except at religious service, he wears the Chinese habit, and never appears out\" of doors in his sacred habiliments. They have one day of rest in seven, and keep it on our Thursday. On being asked if I might be permitted to attend any of their services, it was replied, that if their adherents had business on that day they did not trouble themselves to attend service.  From this excellent man I was able to learn that the stronghold of his religion lies in Hangchau fii, the capital of this province, where there are several large mosques. But the low state of Mohammedanism in this department seems to dampen his spirits not a little. His reigning desire is to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and he made the fullest inquiries as to the probable distance and length of voyage by steam to that sacred city. He made the most particular inquiries also respecting the Mohammedans among the seamen and soldiers that have come to China during the late expedition, and I have promised to introduce him to some of his brethren when the steamer comes to Ningpo.  His adherents in this city are few; one or two of them are officers.  But he does not seem to put much confidence in official favor Happening to see in the mosque, and on the threshold as you enter the sacred ground, a tablet \u2022 similar to that found in every other temple, with the inscription Hto&ngtx, wdnsui, w&nsui, teiinwdnsui, (which is equivalent to saying, \"The emperor, may he live for ever,\" or, \"The emperor, the everliving!\") I asked him how he could allow such a blasphemous monument to stand in a spot which he regarded as consecrated to the worship of 'Aloha,' the name he gives to the one living and true God. He protested that he did not and never would worship it; and as an evidence of the truth of his statement, pointed to the low place given it on the ground-floor, so far removed from the sacred seat; he added, that it was only for the sake of expediency it was allowed any place in the temple, for if they were ever charged by the enemies of Mohammedanism with being disloyal, they could appeal to the presence of this tablet.\n|accessdate=8 May 2011}}(Original from Harvard University)</ref>\n\nThe Hui population of Ningbo were descended from Hui people from Shandong who moved to Ningbo during the 17th century.

ANIGHT'S ride in a comfortable steamer from Shanghai carried the traveler to Ningpo, on the Ningpo river, twelve miles from the sea. This station in the Central China Mission has been occupied by the Presbyterian Board since 1845, and is exerting the influence throughout this great district which one would expect from faithful work over a period of sixty years.  Some of the workers were off on itinerating tours, but the writer met all that were home. He was entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Harrison K. Wright, who were busily engaged'in mastering the Chinese language. If the reader will turn to another page under the heading: \"Woman's Board of Foreign Missions,\" he will learn something about the difficulties which beset the missionary on his arrival in China.  Mrs. Wright was a member of the Crescent Avenue Church, of Plainfleld, N. J., when Dr. Richards, now in the Brick Church, of New York, was its pastor. Although half way around the world, he was still her pastor, and many pleasant recollections were revived by the visit of one who knew and loved the clergyman whose words and example and friendship meant so much for her. As the personal representatives of the Rutgers Church, in New York, the young couple were deeply interested in Dr. Mackenzie and his people, but they did not know them so well as the Plainfleld Church and its former pastor. With their Chinese teachers they were deeply engrossed in their new studies, and life seemed filled with opportunities for service. A little year and a brief cable message from Central China announced the translation of the young wife to another school.  One of the ablest young educational leaders in China is the Rev. Robert F. Fitch, the son of the Rev. George F. Fitch, the head of the great Shanghai Press. Mr. Fitch has recently superintended the starting of the Ningpo College, erected by the Chinese but placed entirely under his management, an unprecedented occurrence in this country. He is to dictate the religious as well as the scholastic influence of the college.  There are four trustees to this institution, and they are natives of the Ningpo Fu. Three of them have Taotai rank, and at present, with the exception of one of them, are in the wholesale business. The one exception, Mr. Li Tsing-u, returned in the spring from an audience with the Emperor and has just received an official appointment in the province of Hupeh. The grandfather of his recent bride is Wong Veng-ziao, of the Wai Wu Pu, or foreign office at Peking. These four men have taken great interest in the college, but the building work had received a temporary check owing to the recent attitude of students from Anglo-Chinese colleges in talking sedition against the present Manchu dynasty. Also the money market has been exceptionally tight during the last few months, so that It was hard to continue the work of raising subscriptions.  Up to the present $21,500 has been paid by the Chinese for ground and building, about $1,000 has been raised and deposited in a bank by Mr. Boa Yinhan, one of our Christians, for the furnishing of the ground floor, and in June the Board of Public Works paid over to Mr. Fitch $2,000 for laboratory equipment. Before long over $1,300 worth of apparatus will have arrived, and Mr. LI Tsing-u has promised a suite of rooms in his semi-foreign hotel for the temporary storing of the apparatus. The trustees decided that the work must be completed this year (1904), and they are taking up the matter with even more energy than before. All that has to be done is to put down the floors and put in the doors and windows. The building is three hundred feet long, over fifty feet deep, doors and windows of red hardwood, and floors of Oregon pine. The coping and pillars are of green stone, the latter being of Corinthian pattern.  It is interesting to note that in all their conversations about the school the trustees show no inclination to depart in the slightest from the original agreement regarding the management and the having of Christian services.  One of the infant Sunday-schools in Ningpo under Mrs. Fitch's supervision has over one hundred scholars. Miss Rolle  stone, Miss Cunningham, Miss Morton and Mr. and Mrs. Kepler have all done itinerating work in the country. Of an interesting plan pursued by Miss Rollestone a recent report states:  \"After this Miss Rollestone arranged for a two months' trip to the Hae-deo region. The trip required more planning than usual, as it was Miss Rollestone's desire to give the Christians there some industrial work in connection with other teaching. The pastor of that district had also been most desirous for a long time of giving them some trade by which they could support themselves when crops failed, and which they might also ply In their leisure time. Weaving the small, rough towels now so commonly used by the Chinese, and which is-at present a good business, was suggested by him, but could not be accomplished at the time. Probably it can be managed at a later date. Making straw hats, the kind worn by the farmers of the locality, was planned for in the meantime. While getting the straw, and making other arrangements which caused some delay, Miss Rollestone bought some native cloth, gathered the young women together with the hope of teaching them how to cut and make their own garments, one garment being promised t\u00a3> each woman when she had finished it. Several young women came. In the forenoon they studied and in the afternoon sewed.\"  Mr. and Mrs. Wright also made during the year their first country tour. For three months and a half Miss Cunningham was in the country, mostly in a houseboat. \"Ten days were spent at a farming village. Here, afternoon meetings were held for the women church members; house to house visiting was also done, and some teaching in the mornings. She lived in the home of one of the Christians, and the work there was much enjoyed. The last two weeks were spent at one of the out-stations, from which many villages and homes were visited, both Christian and heathen. One woman impressed Miss Cunningham as being especially interested in the Gospel story. Her heart seemed to be prepared to receive the truth, and while other women were asking all manner of questions about other things, she said, 'Oh tell me more about the Gospel! I want to learn all I can.' She is a young woman with three children, and her husband is a business man.\"  The last report of the station suggests at the beginning a difficulty which is now felt in almost all missions in China, namely, the change in financial conditions: \"Our force of native workers has remained the same. High prices have made it a hard year for them, but in spite of the temptations they have had, we believe on the whole that the year has been comparatively free from going into lawsuits of a questionable nature. Most of the men are getting old and are unable to do the work they once did, and before long there will be a most pressing need for consecrated, able young men. Most of the latter are students of English in our academy, and as we cannot give them reasonable prospects, we shall probably lose them, and then our work will be most seriously crippled. Young men who would give up a good salary in business for one-half or one-third that amount, to work in the ministry, are worth more than young men who enter the ministry for a smaller amount but who could not make more elsewhere. The former would also build up self-supporting churches more rapidly than the latter. It would be better to get first-class men to work at a sacrifice than to get mediocre men to work for less at no sacrifice.\"  It was a great pleasure to visit the school under the care of the missionaries, and with Dr. Wright and Mr. Fitch and others at different times see the various activities carried on by them, and to learn of the new ventures planned to follow as soon as more workers are sent there.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}(the New York Public Library)</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNrNAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA59\n|title=Annual report, Volumes 66\u201367\n|volume=\n|year=1903\n|author=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

There are four trustees to this institution, and they are natives of the Ningpo Fu. Three of them have Taotai rank, and at present, with the exception of one of them, are in the wholesale business. The one exception, Mr. Li Tsing-u, returned in the spring from an audience with the Emperor and has just received an official appointment in the province of Hupeh. The grandfather of his recent bride is Wong Veng-ziao, of the Wai Wu Pu, or foreign office at Peking. These four men have taken great interest in the college, but the building work had received a temporary check owing to the recent attitude of students from Anglo-Chinese colleges in talking sedition against the present Manchu dynasty. Also the money market has been exceptionally tight during the last few months, so that it was hard to continue the work of raising subscriptions. Up to the present $21,500 has been paid by the Chinese for ground and building, about $1000 has been raised and deposited in a bank by Mr. Boa Yinhan, one of our Christians, for the furnishing of the ground floor, and in June the Board of Public Works paid over to Mr. Fitch $2000 for laboratory equipment. Before long over $1300 worth of apparatus will have arrived, and Mr. Li Tsing-u has promised a suite of rooms in his semi-foreign hotel for the temporary storing of the apparatus. At last, only one day before making this report, the trustees have rallied again and decided that the work must be completed this year, and they are taking up the matter with even more energy than before. All that has to be done is to put down the floors and put in the doors and windows. The building is three hundred feet long, over fifty feet deep, doors and windows of red hardwood, and floors of Oregon pine. The coping and pillars are of green stone, the latter being of Corinthian pattern.  It is interesting to note that in all their conversations about the school the trustees show no inclination to depart in the slightest from the original agreement regarding the management and the having of Christian services.  Twelve have been in attendance at the Girls' Short Term Boarding School, and the building has been got ready for the new Anglo-Chinese School for Girls, from the better families, which previous methods of work have not been able to reach. Fourteen men came to the Men's Training Class, and thirteen women to the Women's Training Class.  The ages of the women ranged from twenty-one to sixty-seven. The majority of them were elderly (over fifty), and that helped to make the work easier, as younger women often have more trouble among themselves, or have children who make trouble.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}(the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison)</ref>\n\nOne of the infant Sunday-schools in Ningpo under Mrs. Fitch's supervision had over 100 scholars.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0WYsAAAAYAAJ\n|title=Annual report of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America\n|volume=\n|year=1904\n|author=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

The report of the Station suggests at the beginning a difficulty which is now felt in almost all Missions in China, namely, the change in financial conditions.  Our force of native workers has remained the same. High prices have made it a hard year for them, but in spite of the temptations they have had, we believe on the whole that the year has been comparatively free from going into lawsuits of a questionable nature. Most of the men are getting old and are unable to do the work they once did, and before long there will be a most pressing need for consecrated, able young men. Most of the latter are students of English in our academy, and as we cannot give them reasonable prospects, we shall probably lose them, and then our work will be most seriously crippled. Young men who would give up a good salary in business tor one-half or one-third that amount, to work in the ministry, are worth more than young men who enter the ministry for a smaller amount but who could not make more elsewhere. The'former would also build up self-supporting churches more rapidly than the latter. It would be better to get first-class men to work at a sacrifice than to get mediocre men to work for less at no sacrifice.  EVANGELISTIC WORK.\u2014The church at Yu-Yiao has raised $800 Mexican toward the erection of their new church building. With reference to the case of Mr. Yi discussed in last year's report, the Station relates:  Mr. Yi, who was formerly pastor in the Zong-yu field, was susponded from the ministry by act of Presbytery in June, 1902. He then went to Shanghai and entered a business position in the Shanghai Dispensary. In February of this, year he moved his family from Zong-yu to Shanghai. Later on, in June, when his term of suspension had come to its limit, a special meeting of Presbytery was called to consider his case, and ultimately all the native members voted to restore Mr. Yi to the ministry.  One of the infant Sunday-schools in Ningpo under Mrs. Fitch's supervision has now over 100 scholars.  Miss Rollestone, Miss Cunningham, Miss Morton and Mr. and Mrs. Kepler have all done itinerating work in the country. Of an interesting plan pursued by Miss Rollestone the report states:  After this Miss Rollestone arranged for a two months' trip to the Hae-deo region. The trip required more planning than usual, as it was Miss Rollestone's desire to give the Christians there some industrial work in connection with other teaching. The pastor of that district had also been most desirous for a long time of giving them some trade by which they could support themselves when crops failed, and which they might also ply in their leisure time. Weaving the small, rough towels now so commonly used by the Chinese, and which is at present a good business, was suggested by him, but could not be accomplished at the time. Probably it can be managed at a later date. Making straw hats, the kind worn by the farmers of the locality, was planned for in the meantime. While getting the straw, and making other arrangements which caused some delay, Miss Rollestone bought f<vte native cloth, gathered the young women together with the hope of teaching them how to cut and make their own garments, one garment being promised to each woman when she had finished it. Several young women came. In the forenoon they studied and in the afternoon sewed.  Mr. and Mrs. Wright also made during the year their first country tour. For three months and a half Miss Cunningham was in the country, mostly in a houseboat.  Ten days were spent at a farming village. Here, afternoon meetings were held for the women church members; house to house visiting was also done, and some teaching in the mornings. She lived in the home of one of the Christians, and the work there was much enjoyed. The last two weeks were spent at one of the out-stations, from which many villages and homes were visited, both Christian and heathen. One woman impressed Miss Cunningham as being especially interested in the Gospel story. Her heart seemed to be prepared to receive the truth, and while other women were asking all manner of questions about other things, she said, \"Oh, tell me more about the Gospel! I want to learn all I can.\" She is a young woman with three children, and her husband is a business man.  EDUCATIONAL.\u2014There are five boys' day-schools, two of which are self-supporting.  The latest one is the school at the Fu-zin church which pastor Zi organized. He secured the services of an excellent English teacher *ho, with a teacher of classics, is doing good work. In the summer examinations the boys were presented for inspection also, and although their faces and hands looked well, yet their finger nails and necks could have endured a little more soap. But it is to their teacher's credit that he looks after them even to this extent.  The only girls' day-school is the primary department of the Boys' Boarding School, which has been, as usual, under Miss Morton's charge.  The enrollment has been thirty-nine. All are children or grandchildren of Christians. One girl was married at the Chinese New Year to a Christian tailor in Hangchow; another served as pupil teacher for a term, and still another, from the China Inland Mission, after several years in the school, returned to her home at the end of the year, where she is doing excellent work teaching the Christians and visiting among the heathen, accompanied by her mother or her aunt. As an impetus to good scholarship in this school, Cupid has impressed three of the girls into his service. One of these is engaged to a young man serving at present in the Diffusion Society. As he expects to take a course in the United States in a college and later in law, it will be many years before they can be married. Meanwhile his affianced hopes to spend a few years in Tokyo, perfecting herself in English and other branches, and then continue her work as teacher.  It would seem to be just the time to send a few picked girls to neighboring Japan to prepare them in the excellent schools already established there for the work of higher education for girls, which must soon come in China. Chinese girls especially need a change of environment to give them larger views of life and higher ideals, that they may be ready to assist in the work of regenerating their country.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}(Harvard University)</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhPPAAAAMAAJ&q=ningpo+station+infant\n|title=Reports of the missionary and benevolent boards and committees to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America\n|volume=\n|year=1904\n|author=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

A Chinese Tribute. Translated by the Rev. J. E. Shoemaker. Note.\u2014The following tribute to the memory of the founder of the Presbyterian Mission at Ningpo was written by the native pastor of the church at Bao KOh-tah, an eastern suburb of that city, some eight miles distant from its center. It is a significant expression of the sentiments still entertained by the native Christian community towards an early missionary in that part of China, thirty years after he has ceased to dwell among them. It shows how beneficent and wide an influence the medical missionary may exert, how deep and lasting an impression he may leave on the minds of the people whom he serves, and how high an estimate the native Chinaman may place upon the enterprise of foreign missions The writer of this tribute bears the name of U6h Cong-eng. Both himself nnd his wife from their childhood remember Dr. McCartee with grateful affection. Both are graduates of the mission schools, which they so worthily represent. His own theological training was received from the early Presbyterian missionaries at Ningpo, and for many years he has been the efficient pastor of the church now in his car*. This article will be followed by another in the next issue of this journal regarding Dr. McCartee as an American missionary statesman. It will exhibit other features of a highly varied career in the Far East, especially the international and political value wnich the foreign missionary has often possessed alike for his own government and for that of the people among whom he lives This is a very different value from that now popularly attributed to the missionary. The article was written by the gentleman who was best acquainted with the facts\u2014the Hon. K. T. Sheppard of San Francisco. late Adviser in International Law to the Government of Japan. Henry W. Rankin. of the Divine plan for him, and dared or. hesitate to endure privation and suffering for Him Who left the glory of heaven and became a man of sorrows, even giving aj His life for man's redemption. The young physician accordingly signified to Dr. Lowrie his willingness to go, and set ui. from New York in October of the same year.  Behold what love for his Saviour and his fellow men in China must have fiEec the breast of this young man of twentythree to enable him to brave the dangers c: the deep, and go alone to that far off lax: to give them the gospel. It was February 19, 1844, when he reached Hongkong, and tarried there and at Macao a few weeks for a favorable opportunity of proceeding north. A little later he made his way la Chusan Island, then held by the Ensr'.-: as a naval station, and, securing the services of a Chinese druggist to act as teacher, began the study of the language He made remarkable progress, and in as almost incredibly short time was able E talk to the people and treat their diseases. In June of this same year he made a trip up the river to Ningpo, where he was by-*pitably received by the British Consul, wrn did what he could to make him comfortable. But the malarial climate proved at first me much for him; and he had to return:? Chusan to recuperate and wait for coaler weather. It was in November that he again returned to Ningpo, and this time succeeded in renting a hovel on the north shore of the river, just opposite the city, and laid the foundations for the Presbyterian Missirin this part of China.  With the exception of a member of the American Baptist Mission, who had arrived a few months earlier, but whose re>> dence in the place was much interrupted and brief, Dr. McCartee was the first missionary to reach Ningpo with a view to remaining. In December, 1844, he secured rooms in the Yiu-sing-kwan, a Taoist temple inside the city near the north gate, where he remained two years, and carried on his medical and evangelistic work. But these were troublous times. Hostilities had barely ceased; the Chinese looked upor all foreigners as enemies and lost no opportunity to persecute them. Dr. McCartee was truly as a Iamb in the midst of wolves. The officials demanded that he be expelled from the temple and sent out of the city; but fortunately his meekness and gentleness won the day; and when he pointed out that he had in no way violated the treaties, nor done any one an injury, they took pity on his loneliness and let him stay. Eventually these same officials were won over to be his warm friends and often asked his assistance when difficulties with a foreign power arose. Dr. McCartee was manifestly a tool of God's own choosing for laying the foundation of this work in Ningpo; for nothing but his loving, peaceful, gentle disposition could have overcome such opposition as he had to meet. His friendly relations with the native scholars enabled him to purchase land on the north bank, and secure an old ancestral hall, and so have habitations ready for Rev. Messrs. Way, Culbertson, Lowrie, and Coulter, who were sent to Ningpo in 1845. In the same year Miss Aldersy, an English lady, became affiliated with these workers, and did much to develop educational work, especially for girls.  Dr. McCartee was one of the prime movers in the establishment of the Boys' School; and when in 1868 Mr. Green wished to move the school, church, and all to Hangchow, it was Dr. McCartee's opposition that hindered this scheme, and so saved to the people of Ningpo the Fu-zin church and the school building; a service which they will never forget who have shared the benefits thus secured.  When the first Presbyterian church was organized in Ningpo in 1845, Dr. McCartee was one of the elders. On the 19th of August, 1849, the Rev. Walter Lowrie, as he was returning from Shanghai in a Chinese junk, fell into the hands of pirates, and was drowned. Dr. McCartee took up the case, pushing it with such energy and perseverance that the officials, very indifferent at first, finally took up the matter earnestly, and captured seven of the pirates, who were summarily executed. So salutary was this example that no foreigner in this region has been molested since that time by pirates. except on one occasion in 1855 when no real harm followed. During the two weary months that this matter dragged on. Dr. McCartee labored so incessantly and with a heart so burdened that he grew haggard and pale as though he had been ill.  Through his efforts a memorial stone was placed in the Ningpo cemetery in honor of Mr. Lowrie, which is there still.  Not only was Dr. McCartee a leading man in his own mission, but he was on such terms with all the members of the other two missions working in Ningpo, the American Baptist and the English Church Missions, that he was largely instrumental in bringing about that condition of harmony and good fellowship which made the three missions practically one. So highly was he esteemed by the men of other missions that when he left Ningpo in 1872 some of them shed tears as they bade him goodbye, saying: \"The Presbyterian Mission is losing a glorious light. This man was truly a blessing to his church and to us all.\"  Dr. McCartee's literary work was considerable, embracing a number of books: \"Verses for Beginners,\" \"The Bible Topically Divided,\" and a \"Harmony of the Gospels\"; also several smaller tracts such as \"The Three Character Classic,\" \"Four Character Classic,\"* \"Six Warnings Against Opium,\" \"The Truth Easily Known,\" \"The Important Teaching of Jesus,\" \"The Three Bonds of Belief,\" \"Laws of the Protestant Church,\" etc. Dr. McCartee also assisted in putting the Ningpo system of Roman script into the final form which has made it such a help to the church in this whole district.  Dr. McCartee was a physician of unusual skill. He had made a reputation for scholarship before leaving America; and upon his arrival in China acquainted himself with the native practice and treatises on medicine. Hence the people, officials and wealthy classes, as well as the common people, had a wonderful confidence in his skill, which was only increased by the success of his treatment. His reputation spread throughout the whole Ningpo region, and whenever he went on his itinerations among the neighboring villages the people received him gladly. They not only entertained him, but willingly rented buildings for the opening of chapels. And converts not a few were the direct result of his medical and evangelistic work. Some who afterwards became useful preachers and teachers were reached in this way.  After the murder of Mr. Lowrie the American government wished Dr. McCartee  \u2022 Both are in constant and wide use yet\u2014J. E. S. to act as consul for Ningpo. He long declined, saying he had no time for any but his religious duties, but finally consented to take the office temporarily. All his dealings with the officials were most friendly; and he never lost an opportunity to explain the gospel to them in his interviews. It was probably in a good measure due to this perfect understanding that the officials of Ningpo have always been willing to protect the Christians in their jurisdiction.  When the new treaties of 1858 opened other ports, Dr. McCartee felt that God was opening doors for the gospel which ought to be entered at once. Accordingly, with a native helper, Zia Ying-tong, he moved to Chefoo, in July, 1862, and there remained three years; being afterwards joined by Dr. Nevius and others. Thus he was the first to open up this great work as well as that at Ningpo. He returned to Ningpo from the north in September, 1865. some time after the expulsion of the Tai-ping rebels from this place; and, after a furlough in the United States during 1869 and 1870, he was by December, 1870, here again.  Dr. McCartee one day met a man who had heard the gospel from Dr. Nevius in Hangchow, where he had been in business until the rebellion drove him to his home near Ningpo. Dr. McCartee took this man to his home, and treated him most cordially, instructing him more fully in the gospel. This opened the way for work in a village seven miles from Ningpo, out of which has grown the Kao-gyiao church. which now has sixty members and a large new building, erected almost entirely by the members themselves. When Rev. William Morrison gave up the church in Bao K6-tah in 1865, being compelled to return to America on account of failing health, the members desired Dr. McCartee to take charge of their church; which he accordingly did as their elder, walking the seven miles to and from Ningpo every Sabbath morning and evening, and thus bearing a strong testimony to the sanctity of the Sabbath day. He would not have another labor on that day merely to give him comfort.  I need not speak of his diligence and willingness to endure hardship, since everybody saw it for themselves. He was carrying on simultaneously four lines of work, either of which might have consumed all of one  man's time\u2014looking after a church, the consular office, literary work, medical work; and besides all this there were many consultations with other workers, both of his own and other missions. From morning till night there was not an idle moment. Even while at his meals he would be reading books and magazines. Because of this overwork and too much exposure to the sun, he was subject to spells of dizziness. In addition to all the above, were weekly trips to Chin-hae and Z-kyi, from which he often returned entirely exhausted; just as Paul says of himself in 2 Cor. xi. 27. Dr. McCartee had regular days and hours for dispensing medicine, but no one was ever sent away empty, no matter at what hour he came, nor did he ever refuse to answer a call, regardless of the distance or difficulties of the journey. Sometimes he would receive the sick into his own home, attending them in person, even sitting up with them through the night; nor did he make a difference in his treatment of Christians and outsiders, but showed the same consideration for all. He never went out but people along the way asked for medicine, and he always supplied them from his case.  His unfailing love was a great stimulus to all those with whom he came into contact One of the prominent traits in Dr. McCartee's character was his sympathy, especially toward fatherless children. In 1866 Mrs. Kying, wife of the pastor of the church in Yu-yiao, died of cholera, followed in a few days by her husband. Dr. McCartee took their little children, a boy of seven and a girl of two and brought them up as his own children. In the eleventh month of the same year the wife of one of the helpers suddenly died, leaving an infant son. Dr. McCartee happened to be present at the time, and wept with the sorrowing husband. Having wrapped the little one in one of his own garments he took it to a foster mother, who nourished and cared for it. In the churches at Ningpo, Kao-gyiao and Bao Ko-tah there were fatherless children brought to him almost every month, and he would find a place for them, paying for their keep from his own purse. This he did for many years, just as the Scripture says in Isa. IviiL 7. He had many boys in school who were orphans of Christians. Indeed fhose who shared his bounty were well nigh numberless. While at home on a furlough between 1869\u20131870, he raised funds to establish a hospital and an orphan asylum in Ningpo, but on his return to the field some dissension in the station hindered his purpose, and we in Ningpo were deprived of the blessing he had planned for us.  Dr. McCartee's home was always open to guests, and they accepted his hospitality in large numbers. His friendly ways both with foreigners and Chinese drew them to him like a magnet. Nor did his welcome fade with the passing days. In his treatment of his servants, too, his consideration was most marked, and they served with great faithfulness, unwilling to leave one who was more like a father than a master. Several of his servants became Christians, and all wept with genuine sorrow when he left Ningpo. I have already told of his care for the children of deceased Christians, nor was his care for the dead less notable. When about to leave Ningpo in 1869, he had stones put at the graves of all deceased Christians, saying, \"Now have I done my duty by the dead.\" Thus all his actions manifested love. When the end of life closed his labors, his parting message was, \"Give my love to all.\" This was all the legacy he left. His money had been used to do good during his lifetime, so that he had little laid by on earth, but he is now enjoying the treasure laid up in heaven, as promised in Matt. xxv. 40.  When Dr. McCartee returned to Ningpo in December, 1870, it was with the purpose of spending the rest of his days there, and he immediately set about arranging for the hospital and asylum, for which the funds had been raised, and the furnishings, medicines, etc., brought with him.  Difficulties arose in the station, and the opposition to his plan developed to such a strength that, with much sorrow of heart, he gave up his cherished plan, returned the money to the donors, and decided to leave Ningpo, which he did in January, 1872. A great crowd of foreigners and Chinese accompanied him to the steamer, many of them in tears. In his parting message to them the doctor said, as the tears streamed down his face: \"It was not my wish to leave you, but now I feel it is better for  me to go than to quarrel with my colleagues. Only my body goes, my heart remains with you. Stand firm in the Lord, my God and your God, my Father and your Father, and in the future we shall meet again in the Saviour's kingdom. This is my parting wish for you. May the Lord abide with you.\"  When he arrived in Shanghai the Consul General for the United States asked him to take the place of one of the consuls who was on sick leave, and this position he occupied for six months. At the end of that time he accepted a chair in the Imperial University of Japan, and prepared at once for his new work. Just as he was setting out for the journey there came a commission from the Chinese government empowering him to act as special envoy to Japan, to secure the release of certain coolies who had been kidnapped. He set out on this double mission in September, 1872. Having discharged his obligations to the Chinese government, he proceeded to Tokyo, and entered upon the duties of instructor in natural science, etc., in the university. His wisdom and learning were much praised by all who knew him, or studied in his classes. But as the story of his twentyeight years' work for Japan has been written in full I need not repeat it here.  The year after he left Ningpo, there came a letter from the Mission Board pointing out the station's mistake in its treatment of Dr. McCartee, and urging that the members of the station write to him, confessing the wrong done him, and asking him to return to Ningpo. This was done, but as a field of usefulness had already opened for him in Japan he decided to remain there. Yet, true to his parting word, his heart remained ever in Ningpo. He always delighted to meet any one from there, and missed no opportunity to send back greetings to hrs host of friends. Moreover, he continued through his life to send money for the aid of Bao K6-tah helping the people with their new building, and making an annual subscription to the pastor's salary, besides aiding in the support of sev eral poor dependents under the church's care. His love never failed while life lasted.  In October, 1899, he returned to his native land, on account of failing health, and took up his residence in San Francisco, Cal.  There on the 17th of July, 1900, his earthly labors ended at the ripe age of nearly eightyone. At his death, as in his life, his one thought was love. \"Divide my love among all\"\u2014was a true expression of the whole motive of his life. His love flowed out as the ceaseless flow of a river. Who has not been a sharer in it? As the Lord Jesus Himself, so this true servant became poor that others might be made rich. His only store was that laid up in heaven.  Though Dr. McCartee is dead, he yet lives even here. There are four ways in which he lives: (1) The books which he wrote are still being read, and in them he still speaks to men; (2) those who were helped by him are still here to proclaim his praises; (3) those who were his pupils are still here, living out his instructions\u2014his life is reproduced in them; (4) his example is fixed indelibly in the hearts of all who knew him, and stirs them with a desire to be such as he was. Is it not eminently true of Dr. McCartee as the Scripture says. \"He being dead yet speaketh\"?  At the meeting of the Ningpo Presbytery in the fall of 1900, when the death of Dr McCartee was reported, all were very sorrowfull, and expressed the hope that his life in Ningpo might be recorded in a permanent form, so that it might be known by succeeding generations. A committee was therefore appointed, consisting of Uoh Cong-eng, Lu Cing-veng and Su Me-lcah (Shoemaker), to prepare a biography with the hope that funds might be procured to have it printed. In accordance with the will of the presbytery this brief outline of Dr. McCartee's life has been drawn up, to help us remember him and follow his example of faithfulness to the Lord and love to men, knowing that if we follow earnestly his example we shall meet him at the Lord's side, and with him enjoy eternal bliss. This is our longing desire.  Signed by the Committee,  Uoh Cong-eng.

A correspondent of the Pr&byterian write* from Ningpo. China. Nov. <5:  The Presbytery of Ningpo held its annual meeting at Ningpo. commencing October 31st, and ending November 5th. The opening sermon was preached by the retiring Moderator. Rev. J. Butler, from Uaiab. 57; 15, after which the Rev. Baa Kwonghji was chosen Moderator.  On Monday evening, after prayer meeting, there was a regular meeting of Presbytery, at which time an account of the work in the different fields of labour was given by the members of Presbytery. The dark, as well as the bright side was brought out by almost every speaker, and the encouragements and discouragements of the work were set forth in such a way as to make the listener feel that the presbyters were anxiously desiring to fulfil the trust committed to them. Some of them reported additions to their churches, and also report*d a number of inquirers who were desiring of uniting with the church, noting the obstacles which were in the way of inquirers publicly confessing Christ.  Another interesting account was given of an opium smoker who was an anxious inquirer, but was not quite willing to endure the suffering which the casting off of his opium would bring upon him.  Another brother gave an account of an inquirer who kept a shop for the sale of idolatrous articles, who, by becoming a Christian, would have to give up his present means of livelihood.  Another related the case of a man who was secretary to the governor of the province, who wanted to unite with the church, but as his duties required his presence at the Yarnen all the morning, he was only able to keep half of the \"Lord's day,\" therefore was not admitted to church membership.  Another interesting case was narrated of an itinerant doctor who bad been an inquirer for some time, and had passed a very good examination before the session, but could not see his way clear to keep the Sabbath. He is obliged to be at his port on every market day, which sometimes occurs on the Sabbath, or he will lose his business. Many interesting cases were told of those who were willing to risk the loss of all things to gain Christ.  On Tuesday they bad a very interesting session, when several practical questions were discussed.  First. \"Marriages and Funerals.\" What can lie done to lessen the expenses connected with these two important events? The discussion was opened by Rev. Uoh Cang-eng.  He bemoaned the necessity for the great expenses connected with marriages and funerals, but could suggest no way out of the difficulty; possibly marriages might be brought about with less display, but as to funerals the Christians bad already, in many ways, curtailed the burial ceremonies, and he could not see that they could at present lessen expenses. He would, however, venture to suggest that Presbytery might fix a certain price to be paid for the bride\u2014say $48 as the minimum, and $60 as the maximum to be paid over to the parents of the girl. Another brother thought this sum too small, and suggested that $60 ah on id be the minimum and $100 the maximum price for a bride. One brother thought the fault lay mostly with the women, and it would be a good plan to exhort them to dispense with costly bridal ornaments and ex pensive outfits.  The Rev Zi Kyno jing said he had been able to persuade a few brides to give up certain expensive articles of dress and jewelry, and to appear plainer as becomes Christian women. The Rev. Yi Zing fah said that the maidens were most unwilling to dispense with what they considered a be coming outfit, and notwithstanding what was believed to the contrary, the youthful bride had somewhat to say as to what her outfit should be. She was determined to appear in what would be considered proper style, and if she could not, would burst into tears, and instead of the mirth of the marriage-feast they would hear the wailings of a funeral. Several of the brethren acknowledged that the heavy debts which most of them bore were the result of the expenses connected with marriages.  The second question was \"Occupation* for the Children of Native Christians.\" This was opened by the Rev. Zi Kyno jing, and was freely discussed. Many examples were cited to show what efforts had been made by Christian parents to secure work for their sons which would not involve them in heathen practices. In some instances arrangements were made with the employer, that if the boy should be allowed to keep the Sabbath his apprenticeship should continue for six months longer than the usual term, or the sum of money received at the end of his time should be less than that commonly received. One brother spoke of the difficulties connected with learning trades or being clerks. The custom is that the boys must perform the idolatrous service before the patron god, and an arrangement must be made to free the Icy from this duty. As there are plenty of heathen boys who would gladly perform this service, they, of course, are taken in preference to those who are unwilling to do this idolatrous work. The more genteel the employment the more idolatry was there connected with it, and the more menial the employment the fewer the obstacles there were connected with it. It was urged that all the boys should have some education enough, at least, to enable them to read the Scriptures.  The third question was, \"The Best Method for Securing Self support.\" It was opened by the Rev. Bao Kwonghyi. Mr. Bao urged the pastors to exhort the people to give. He was interrupted by an elder, who said, \"What! a pastor ask for his own support 1 that would be a hard thing to do. No,\" said he, \"a pastor cannot exhort the people to give to his own support.\" Mr. Bao replied, \"I think I shall exhort my people to give.\" I may remark that Mr. Fino's church shows that the pastor has exhorted his people to give, for in the matter of self support it is the best in the Presbytery. The rev. Uoh Cang eng thought the pastor should urge his people to give, and they should be told, before uniting with the church, that it was a Christian duty to give as God had prospered them. He thought some of the difficulty lay in the pastor having too much pity for his people, and too much fear of offending them. Mr. Uoh is pastor of a self-supporting church. The Rev. J. Butler reminded them that the money given was not to the pastor, nor to the poor, but to the Lord. A pastor must not appear before his people as a beggar, but as one who is teaching the Lord's will concerning his people. The Presbytery seemed quite stirred up on this subject, and alive to the fact that giving is a Christian duty.  The fourth subject was \"Foot-binding.\" The discussion was opened by Yu Kohtsing, who tried to set forth some of the disadvantages connected with the practice of foot binding. There was nothing to be said in its favor except that it was the custom to bind their daughters' feet. Some of the speakers could not see that it was any more sinful than some customs of foreign countries which are tolerated amongst Christians. Others thought it was at least a step in advance to agitate the subject, and referred to what had already been done by individuals in the direction of unbinding their daughters' feet. A number of cases could be pointed to where the wives and daughters had unbound feet, and hope was expressed that in a few years at least there would not be any bound feet amongst the Christians.  At the 3 o'clock P. M. a special meeting was held in view of the present stale of affairs in China. The burden of the prayers and exhortations was that, whatever the outcome of the war should be, God might be glorified and China become a Christian nation.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}()</ref>\n\nThe Status of the Presbyterian Mission in Ningbo in 1845 was stated as: \"Ningpo: on the Ningpo River, 12 miles from the sea; occupied as a Mission station, 1845\u2013 missionary laborers\u2014Rev.

The anti-foreign party may push matters to an extremity. They may think the present an opportune moment to carry out their policy, viz. the expulsion of foreigners; and outrages may be committed where there is no such pretence as that of which they availed themselves at Tien tsin. There is undoubtedly, along the coast, a very restless feeling, even in places which have been remarkably free from such disquietude. We may quote, in proof of this, the following letter from our Corresponding Secretary at Ningpo, the Rev.W. A. Russell, dated July 26 of the present year.  Since I last wrote to you we have been passing through one of those extraordinary panics, so many of which I had experienced in past years, but which I had hoped, from the unusual quietness which prevailed in this province since my return to China, were to be known amongst us no more. The cause of it has been the dreadful massacre which has taken place at Tien tsin. It has indeed been a most awful affair, such as I could scarcely have believed the Chinese capable of perpetrating. The singular feature of it is, that it should have been directed in such a marked way against the Roman Catholics and the French. This, no doubt, from some as yet unascertained cause, was the original programme; but when the work of destruction was once begun, the wonder is that it went no further. The shock of it naturally vibrated through every European community in China, from Peking to Hong Kong, and led at each place the evil-disposed to work upon the fears and hopes of the people, and to avail themselves of the opportunity to drive all foreigners out of China. For this purpose a most able but most inflammatory paper has been widely circulated among the readers of this province, and probably elsewhere. It purports to be a letter from Tseng-kwo-fan, the governor of the Chih-li province, to Mr. Wade, and deals at length with the three points of commercial intercourse, the propagation of Christianity, and the future independence of the Chinese Empire. It was so ably drawn up, and so calculated to produce the end it had in view, that I thought it wise to make a translation of it, and to send it to one of the Shanghae papers for publication, in order to show foreigners in China the steps that were being taken to excite the populace against them. It has certainly roused the people against us in this place in a most extraordinary way\u2014at one time almost to the verge of open violence; but happily just at present  things are beginning to assume a quieter aspect again. None of us have as yet left our posts; neither our dear brother, George Moule, who, with his family, are alone at Hangchow, nor Mr. Gretton, who has also firmly held on at Shaou-hying under most trying circumstances. I am in hopes that the storm will be weathered, although a good deal will depend upon the way in which the Tien tsin affair is settled, and that by the kind care and over-ruling providence of the Almighty, wo may be permitted still to go on with the prosecution of our work in this province. Our position, however, at present, is one of great danger and of great perplexity, needing the prayers and sympathies of our Christian friends in England, that we may he kept in this hour of trial, and have that faith in God, and that practical wisdom imparted unto us which wo now especially need.  In all probability the present crisis in China will be overruled, and that speedily, to further concessions to Europeans, and further openings for Missionary work throughout the Chinese Empire. Let us not, then, be fainthearted, but go forward in the full assurance of faith, that China, as well as the rest of the world, will be given to the Son for His inheritance, and that man's extremity is very often God's opportunity. I myself am firmly convinced that this is not the time for ua to be resting on our oars, but to be up and doing, with boldness, energy, and faithfulness to our Master, the work which He has committed to us. For such services we want, indeed, men who will not flinch at the cry of battle: others had better stay at home; but with such, and with our great Captain leading us on, victory must be ours.

The tankia, or boat-people, at Canton form a class in some respects beneath the other portions of the community, and have many customs peculiar to themselves. At Ningpo there is a degraded set called to min, amounting to nearly three thousand persons, with whom the people will not associate. The men are not allowed to enter the examinations or follow an honorable calling, but are play-actors, musicians, or sedan-bearers; the women are match-makers or female barbers and are obliged to wear a peculiar dress, and usually go abroad carrying a bundle wrapped in a checkered handkerchief. The tankia at Canton also wear a similar handkerchief on their head, and do not cramp their feet. The to min are supposed to be descendants of the Kin, who held northern China in A.d. 1100, or of native traitors who aided the Japanese, in 15551563, in their descent upon Chehkiang. The tankia came from some of the Miaotsz' tribes so early that their origin is unknown.1  The modern classifications of the people, recognized, however, more by law than custom, are various and comprehensive. First, natives and aliens; the latter include the unsubdued mountaineers and aboriginal tribes living in various parts, races of boat-people on the coasts, and all foreigners residing within the Empire, each of whom are subject to particular laws. Second, conquerors and conquered; having reference almost entirely to a prohibition of intermarriages between Manchus and Chinese. Third, freemen and slaves; every native is allowed to purchase slaves and retain their children in servitude, and free persons sometimes forfeit their freedom on account of their crimes, or mortgage themselves into bondage. Fourth, the honorable and the mean, who cannot intermarry without the former forfeiting their privileges; the latter comprise, besides aliens and slaves, criminals, executioners, police-runners, actors, jugglers, beggars, and all other vagrant or vile persons, who are in general required to pursue for three generations some honorable and useful employment before they are eligible to enter the literary examinations. These four divisions extend over the whole body of the people, but really affect only a small minority.  It is worthy of note how few have been the slaves in China, and how easy has been their condition in comparison with what' it was in Greece and Rome. Owing chiefly to the prevalence of education in the liberal principles of the Four Books, China has been saved from this disintegrating element. The proportion of slaves to freemen cannot be stated, but the former have never attracted notice by their numbers nor excited dread by their restiveness. Girls are more readily sold than boys; at Peking a healthy girl under twelve years brings from thirty to fifty taels, rising to two hundred and fifty or three hundred for one of seventeen to eighteen years old. In times of famine orphans or needy children are exposed for sale at the price of a few cash.1\n|accessdate=8 May 2011}}(Original from Harvard University)</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qUMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA412&dq=At+Ningpo+there+is+a+degraded+set+called+the+Min,+amounting+to+nearly+three+thousand+persons,+with+whom+the+people&hl=en&ei=X-DRTe7KNsrB0AHvvuXQCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=At%20Ningpo%20there%20is%20a%20degraded%20set%20called%20the%20Min%2C%20amounting%20to%20nearly%20three%20thousand%20persons%2C%20with%20whom%20the%20people&f=false\n|title=The Middle Kingdom: a survey of the geography, government, literature, social life, arts, and history of the Chinese empire and its inhabitants, Volume 1\n|author=Samuel Wells Williams\n|year=1882\n|edition=revised\n|publisher=C.

He visited the mosque of the local [[Hui people]]. The imam was  from Shandong, and claimed to be  a descendant of Muslims from the city of [[Medina]]. He spoke both Arabic and Chinese, and could read Arabic as well. Around 30 families attended his congregation, Quranic verses decorated his apartments, and his possessions included Muslim holy texts and clothing. However, the imam described [[Hangzhou]] as being the \"Stronghold\" of Islam in the region.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wEMAAAAYAAJ&q=mohammedan#v=onepage&q=mohammedan%20temple%20arabic&f=false\n|title=The Chinese repository, Volume 13\n|year=1844\n|edition=\n|publisher=Printed for the proprietors\n|location=VICTORIA HONGKONG\n|page=31\n|isbn=\n|quote=In my peregrinations, I called at the mosque, over the entrance to which are engraved on a stone in large characters Hioui-hwui I'ang, i. e. Mohammedan temple. The head priest is a man of a remarkably benign and intelligent countenance. His air is very gentlemanly. He must be 45 years of age. His figure is slender but tall. His native place is in Shantung, but his ancestors came from Medina in Arabia. He himself can read the Arabic scriptures most readily, and talks that language fluently; but of Chinese writing and reading, he is as ignorant as an Englishman in England. This is very surprising, considering that he can talk it so well, was born and educated in China, and is a minister of religion among the Chinese. He laments much that his supporters are so few ;\u2014they do not number more than twenty or thirty families. He took me into the place of worship, which adjoins his apartments. On ascending a flight of steps, you get under a plain roof, beneath which, on either side, you find a mass of old furniture and agricultural implements covered with dust. The pillars to support the roof are ornamented with sentences out of the Koran.* Facing you is an ornamented pair of small doors hung upon the wall, within which the sacred seat is supposed to lie; and on one side is a convenient book-case that contains the Mohammedan scriptures in 24 parts. He showed me his usual officiating dress, which is simply a white robe with a pointed turban. Except at religious service, he wears the Chinese habit, and never appears out\" of doors in his sacred habiliments. They have one day of rest in seven, and keep it on our Thursday. On being asked if I might be permitted to attend any of their services, it was replied, that if their adherents had business on that day they did not trouble themselves to attend service.  From this excellent man I was able to learn that the stronghold of his religion lies in Hangchau fii, the capital of this province, where there are several large mosques. But the low state of Mohammedanism in this department seems to dampen his spirits not a little. His reigning desire is to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and he made the fullest inquiries as to the probable distance and length of voyage by steam to that sacred city. He made the most particular inquiries also respecting the Mohammedans among the seamen and soldiers that have come to China during the late expedition, and I have promised to introduce him to some of his brethren when the steamer comes to Ningpo.  His adherents in this city are few; one or two of them are officers.  But he does not seem to put much confidence in official favor Happening to see in the mosque, and on the threshold as you enter the sacred ground, a tablet \u2022 similar to that found in every other temple, with the inscription Hto&ngtx, wdnsui, w&nsui, teiinwdnsui, (which is equivalent to saying, \"The emperor, may he live for ever,\" or, \"The emperor, the everliving!\") I asked him how he could allow such a blasphemous monument to stand in a spot which he regarded as consecrated to the worship of 'Aloha,' the name he gives to the one living and true God. He protested that he did not and never would worship it; and as an evidence of the truth of his statement, pointed to the low place given it on the ground-floor, so far removed from the sacred seat; he added, that it was only for the sake of expediency it was allowed any place in the temple, for if they were ever charged by the enemies of Mohammedanism with being disloyal, they could appeal to the presence of this tablet.\n|accessdate=8 May 2011}}(Original from Harvard University)</ref>\n\nThe Hui population of Ningbo were descended from Hui people from Shandong who moved to Ningbo during the 17th century. Their main profession was trade, and they spoke the Shandong Mandarin dialect. The Hui Muslim mosque was called \"Hwuy-Hwuy Tang\" HuiHui Tang, in Chinese. The keepers of the building were from Shandong and spoke Mandarin. The mosque was a small building, with many Arabic inscriptions, 500 Muslims lived in Ningbo.

ANIGHT'S ride in a comfortable steamer from Shanghai carried the traveler to Ningpo, on the Ningpo river, twelve miles from the sea. This station in the Central China Mission has been occupied by the Presbyterian Board since 1845, and is exerting the influence throughout this great district which one would expect from faithful work over a period of sixty years.  Some of the workers were off on itinerating tours, but the writer met all that were home. He was entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Harrison K. Wright, who were busily engaged'in mastering the Chinese language. If the reader will turn to another page under the heading: \"Woman's Board of Foreign Missions,\" he will learn something about the difficulties which beset the missionary on his arrival in China.  Mrs. Wright was a member of the Crescent Avenue Church, of Plainfleld, N. J., when Dr. Richards, now in the Brick Church, of New York, was its pastor. Although half way around the world, he was still her pastor, and many pleasant recollections were revived by the visit of one who knew and loved the clergyman whose words and example and friendship meant so much for her. As the personal representatives of the Rutgers Church, in New York, the young couple were deeply interested in Dr. Mackenzie and his people, but they did not know them so well as the Plainfleld Church and its former pastor. With their Chinese teachers they were deeply engrossed in their new studies, and life seemed filled with opportunities for service. A little year and a brief cable message from Central China announced the translation of the young wife to another school.  One of the ablest young educational leaders in China is the Rev. Robert F. Fitch, the son of the Rev. George F. Fitch, the head of the great Shanghai Press. Mr. Fitch has recently superintended the starting of the Ningpo College, erected by the Chinese but placed entirely under his management, an unprecedented occurrence in this country. He is to dictate the religious as well as the scholastic influence of the college.  There are four trustees to this institution, and they are natives of the Ningpo Fu. Three of them have Taotai rank, and at present, with the exception of one of them, are in the wholesale business. The one exception, Mr. Li Tsing-u, returned in the spring from an audience with the Emperor and has just received an official appointment in the province of Hupeh. The grandfather of his recent bride is Wong Veng-ziao, of the Wai Wu Pu, or foreign office at Peking. These four men have taken great interest in the college, but the building work had received a temporary check owing to the recent attitude of students from Anglo-Chinese colleges in talking sedition against the present Manchu dynasty. Also the money market has been exceptionally tight during the last few months, so that It was hard to continue the work of raising subscriptions.  Up to the present $21,500 has been paid by the Chinese for ground and building, about $1,000 has been raised and deposited in a bank by Mr. Boa Yinhan, one of our Christians, for the furnishing of the ground floor, and in June the Board of Public Works paid over to Mr. Fitch $2,000 for laboratory equipment. Before long over $1,300 worth of apparatus will have arrived, and Mr. LI Tsing-u has promised a suite of rooms in his semi-foreign hotel for the temporary storing of the apparatus. The trustees decided that the work must be completed this year (1904), and they are taking up the matter with even more energy than before. All that has to be done is to put down the floors and put in the doors and windows. The building is three hundred feet long, over fifty feet deep, doors and windows of red hardwood, and floors of Oregon pine. The coping and pillars are of green stone, the latter being of Corinthian pattern.  It is interesting to note that in all their conversations about the school the trustees show no inclination to depart in the slightest from the original agreement regarding the management and the having of Christian services.  One of the infant Sunday-schools in Ningpo under Mrs. Fitch's supervision has over one hundred scholars. Miss Rolle  stone, Miss Cunningham, Miss Morton and Mr. and Mrs. Kepler have all done itinerating work in the country. Of an interesting plan pursued by Miss Rollestone a recent report states:  \"After this Miss Rollestone arranged for a two months' trip to the Hae-deo region. The trip required more planning than usual, as it was Miss Rollestone's desire to give the Christians there some industrial work in connection with other teaching. The pastor of that district had also been most desirous for a long time of giving them some trade by which they could support themselves when crops failed, and which they might also ply In their leisure time. Weaving the small, rough towels now so commonly used by the Chinese, and which is-at present a good business, was suggested by him, but could not be accomplished at the time. Probably it can be managed at a later date. Making straw hats, the kind worn by the farmers of the locality, was planned for in the meantime. While getting the straw, and making other arrangements which caused some delay, Miss Rollestone bought some native cloth, gathered the young women together with the hope of teaching them how to cut and make their own garments, one garment being promised t\u00a3> each woman when she had finished it. Several young women came. In the forenoon they studied and in the afternoon sewed.\"  Mr. and Mrs. Wright also made during the year their first country tour. For three months and a half Miss Cunningham was in the country, mostly in a houseboat. \"Ten days were spent at a farming village. Here, afternoon meetings were held for the women church members; house to house visiting was also done, and some teaching in the mornings. She lived in the home of one of the Christians, and the work there was much enjoyed. The last two weeks were spent at one of the out-stations, from which many villages and homes were visited, both Christian and heathen. One woman impressed Miss Cunningham as being especially interested in the Gospel story. Her heart seemed to be prepared to receive the truth, and while other women were asking all manner of questions about other things, she said, 'Oh tell me more about the Gospel! I want to learn all I can.' She is a young woman with three children, and her husband is a business man.\"  The last report of the station suggests at the beginning a difficulty which is now felt in almost all missions in China, namely, the change in financial conditions: \"Our force of native workers has remained the same. High prices have made it a hard year for them, but in spite of the temptations they have had, we believe on the whole that the year has been comparatively free from going into lawsuits of a questionable nature. Most of the men are getting old and are unable to do the work they once did, and before long there will be a most pressing need for consecrated, able young men. Most of the latter are students of English in our academy, and as we cannot give them reasonable prospects, we shall probably lose them, and then our work will be most seriously crippled. Young men who would give up a good salary in business for one-half or one-third that amount, to work in the ministry, are worth more than young men who enter the ministry for a smaller amount but who could not make more elsewhere. The former would also build up self-supporting churches more rapidly than the latter. It would be better to get first-class men to work at a sacrifice than to get mediocre men to work for less at no sacrifice.\"  It was a great pleasure to visit the school under the care of the missionaries, and with Dr. Wright and Mr. Fitch and others at different times see the various activities carried on by them, and to learn of the new ventures planned to follow as soon as more workers are sent there.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}(the New York Public Library)</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNrNAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA59&dq=Li+Veng-eing+Ningpo&hl=en&ei=W7fhTvm2Asbc0QHxvdTIBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDsQ6AEwADgU\n|title=Annual report, Volumes 66-67\n|volume=\n|year=1903\n|author=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

The report of the Station suggests at the beginning a difficulty which is now felt in almost all Missions in China, namely, the change in financial conditions.  Our force of native workers has remained the same. High prices have made it a hard year for them, but in spite of the temptations they have had, we believe on the whole that the year has been comparatively free from going into lawsuits of a questionable nature.

The'former would also build up self-supporting churches more rapidly than the latter. It would be better to get first-class men to work at a sacrifice than to get mediocre men to work for less at no sacrifice.  EVANGELISTIC WORK.\u2014The church at Yu-Yiao has raised $800 Mexican toward the erection of their new church building. With reference to the case of Mr. Yi discussed in last year's report, the Station relates:  Mr. Yi, who was formerly pastor in the Zong-yu field, was susponded from the ministry by act of Presbytery in June, 1902. He then went to Shanghai and entered a business position in the Shanghai Dispensary. In February of this, year he moved his family from Zong-yu to Shanghai. Later on, in June, when his term of suspension had come to its limit, a special meeting of Presbytery was called to consider his case, and ultimately all the native members voted to restore Mr. Yi to the ministry.  One of the infant Sunday-schools in Ningpo under Mrs. Fitch's supervision has now over 100 scholars.  Miss Rollestone, Miss Cunningham, Miss Morton and Mr. and Mrs. Kepler have all done itinerating work in the country. Of an interesting plan pursued by Miss Rollestone the report states:  After this Miss Rollestone arranged for a two months' trip to the Hae-deo region. The trip required more planning than usual, as it was Miss Rollestone's desire to give the Christians there some industrial work in connection with other teaching. The pastor of that district had also been most desirous for a long time of giving them some trade by which they could support themselves when crops failed, and which they might also ply in their leisure time. Weaving the small, rough towels now so commonly used by the Chinese, and which is at present a good business, was suggested by him, but could not be accomplished at the time. Probably it can be managed at a later date. Making straw hats, the kind worn by the farmers of the locality, was planned for in the meantime. While getting the straw, and making other arrangements which caused some delay, Miss Rollestone bought f<vte native cloth, gathered the young women together with the hope of teaching them how to cut and make their own garments, one garment being promised to each woman when she had finished it. Several young women came. In the forenoon they studied and in the afternoon sewed.  Mr. and Mrs. Wright also made during the year their first country tour. For three months and a half Miss Cunningham was in the country, mostly in a houseboat.  Ten days were spent at a farming village. Here, afternoon meetings were held for the women church members; house to house visiting was also done, and some teaching in the mornings. She lived in the home of one of the Christians, and the work there was much enjoyed. The last two weeks were spent at one of the out-stations, from which many villages and homes were visited, both Christian and heathen. One woman impressed Miss Cunningham as being especially interested in the Gospel story. Her heart seemed to be prepared to receive the truth, and while other women were asking all manner of questions about other things, she said, \"Oh, tell me more about the Gospel! I want to learn all I can.\" She is a young woman with three children, and her husband is a business man.  EDUCATIONAL.\u2014There are five boys' day-schools, two of which are self-supporting.  The latest one is the school at the Fu-zin church which pastor Zi organized. He secured the services of an excellent English teacher *ho, with a teacher of classics, is doing good work. In the summer examinations the boys were presented for inspection also, and although their faces and hands looked well, yet their finger nails and necks could have endured a little more soap. But it is to their teacher's credit that he looks after them even to this extent.  The only girls' day-school is the primary department of the Boys' Boarding School, which has been, as usual, under Miss Morton's charge.  The enrollment has been thirty-nine. All are children or grandchildren of Christians. One girl was married at the Chinese New Year to a Christian tailor in Hangchow; another served as pupil teacher for a term, and still another, from the China Inland Mission, after several years in the school, returned to her home at the end of the year, where she is doing excellent work teaching the Christians and visiting among the heathen, accompanied by her mother or her aunt. As an impetus to good scholarship in this school, Cupid has impressed three of the girls into his service. One of these is engaged to a young man serving at present in the Diffusion Society. As he expects to take a course in the United States in a college and later in law, it will be many years before they can be married. Meanwhile his affianced hopes to spend a few years in Tokyo, perfecting herself in English and other branches, and then continue her work as teacher.  It would seem to be just the time to send a few picked girls to neighboring Japan to prepare them in the excellent schools already established there for the work of higher education for girls, which must soon come in China. Chinese girls especially need a change of environment to give them larger views of life and higher ideals, that they may be ready to assist in the work of regenerating their country.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}(Harvard University)</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhPPAAAAMAAJ&q=ningpo+station+infant\n|title=Reports of the missionary and benevolent boards and committees to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America\n|volume=\n|year=1904\n|author=Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

A Chinese Tribute. Translated by the Rev. J. E. Shoemaker. Note.\u2014The following tribute to the memory of the founder of the Presbyterian Mission at Ningpo was written by the native pastor of the church at Bao KOh-tah, an eastern suburb of that city, some eight miles distant from its center. It is a significant expression of the sentiments still entertained by the native Christian community towards an early missionary in that part of China, thirty years after he has ceased to dwell among them. It shows how beneficent and wide an influence the medical missionary may exert, how deep and lasting an impression he may leave on the minds of the people whom he serves, and how high an estimate the native Chinaman may place upon the enterprise of foreign missions The writer of this tribute bears the name of U6h Cong-eng. Both himself nnd his wife from their childhood remember Dr. McCartee with grateful affection. Both are graduates of the mission schools, which they so worthily represent. His own theological training was received from the early Presbyterian missionaries at Ningpo, and for many years he has been the efficient pastor of the church now in his car*. This article will be followed by another in the next issue of this journal regarding Dr. McCartee as an American missionary statesman. It will exhibit other features of a highly varied career in the Far East, especially the international and political value wnich the foreign missionary has often possessed alike for his own government and for that of the people among whom he lives This is a very different value from that now popularly attributed to the missionary. The article was written by the gentleman who was best acquainted with the facts\u2014the Hon. K. T. Sheppard of San Francisco. late Adviser in International Law to the Government of Japan. Henry W. Rankin. of the Divine plan for him, and dared or. hesitate to endure privation and suffering for Him Who left the glory of heaven and became a man of sorrows, even giving aj His life for man's redemption. The young physician accordingly signified to Dr. Lowrie his willingness to go, and set ui. from New York in October of the same year.  Behold what love for his Saviour and his fellow men in China must have fiEec the breast of this young man of twentythree to enable him to brave the dangers c: the deep, and go alone to that far off lax: to give them the gospel. It was February 19, 1844, when he reached Hongkong, and tarried there and at Macao a few weeks for a favorable opportunity of proceeding north. A little later he made his way la Chusan Island, then held by the Ensr'.-: as a naval station, and, securing the services of a Chinese druggist to act as teacher, began the study of the language He made remarkable progress, and in as almost incredibly short time was able E talk to the people and treat their diseases. In June of this same year he made a trip up the river to Ningpo, where he was by-*pitably received by the British Consul, wrn did what he could to make him comfortable. But the malarial climate proved at first me much for him; and he had to return:? Chusan to recuperate and wait for coaler weather. It was in November that he again returned to Ningpo, and this time succeeded in renting a hovel on the north shore of the river, just opposite the city, and laid the foundations for the Presbyterian Missirin this part of China.  With the exception of a member of the American Baptist Mission, who had arrived a few months earlier, but whose re>> dence in the place was much interrupted and brief, Dr. McCartee was the first missionary to reach Ningpo with a view to remaining. In December, 1844, he secured rooms in the Yiu-sing-kwan, a Taoist temple inside the city near the north gate, where he remained two years, and carried on his medical and evangelistic work. But these were troublous times. Hostilities had barely ceased; the Chinese looked upor all foreigners as enemies and lost no opportunity to persecute them. Dr. McCartee was truly as a Iamb in the midst of wolves. The officials demanded that he be expelled from the temple and sent out of the city; but fortunately his meekness and gentleness won the day; and when he pointed out that he had in no way violated the treaties, nor done any one an injury, they took pity on his loneliness and let him stay. Eventually these same officials were won over to be his warm friends and often asked his assistance when difficulties with a foreign power arose. Dr. McCartee was manifestly a tool of God's own choosing for laying the foundation of this work in Ningpo; for nothing but his loving, peaceful, gentle disposition could have overcome such opposition as he had to meet. His friendly relations with the native scholars enabled him to purchase land on the north bank, and secure an old ancestral hall, and so have habitations ready for Rev. Messrs. Way, Culbertson, Lowrie, and Coulter, who were sent to Ningpo in 1845. In the same year Miss Aldersy, an English lady, became affiliated with these workers, and did much to develop educational work, especially for girls.  Dr. McCartee was one of the prime movers in the establishment of the Boys' School; and when in 1868 Mr. Green wished to move the school, church, and all to Hangchow, it was Dr. McCartee's opposition that hindered this scheme, and so saved to the people of Ningpo the Fu-zin church and the school building; a service which they will never forget who have shared the benefits thus secured.  When the first Presbyterian church was organized in Ningpo in 1845, Dr. McCartee was one of the elders. On the 19th of August, 1849, the Rev. Walter Lowrie, as he was returning from Shanghai in a Chinese junk, fell into the hands of pirates, and was drowned. Dr. McCartee took up the case, pushing it with such energy and perseverance that the officials, very indifferent at first, finally took up the matter earnestly, and captured seven of the pirates, who were summarily executed. So salutary was this example that no foreigner in this region has been molested since that time by pirates. except on one occasion in 1855 when no real harm followed. During the two weary months that this matter dragged on. Dr. McCartee labored so incessantly and with a heart so burdened that he grew haggard and pale as though he had been ill.  Through his efforts a memorial stone was placed in the Ningpo cemetery in honor of Mr. Lowrie, which is there still.  Not only was Dr. McCartee a leading man in his own mission, but he was on such terms with all the members of the other two missions working in Ningpo, the American Baptist and the English Church Missions, that he was largely instrumental in bringing about that condition of harmony and good fellowship which made the three missions practically one. So highly was he esteemed by the men of other missions that when he left Ningpo in 1872 some of them shed tears as they bade him goodbye, saying: \"The Presbyterian Mission is losing a glorious light. This man was truly a blessing to his church and to us all.\"  Dr. McCartee's literary work was considerable, embracing a number of books: \"Verses for Beginners,\" \"The Bible Topically Divided,\" and a \"Harmony of the Gospels\"; also several smaller tracts such as \"The Three Character Classic,\" \"Four Character Classic,\"* \"Six Warnings Against Opium,\" \"The Truth Easily Known,\" \"The Important Teaching of Jesus,\" \"The Three Bonds of Belief,\" \"Laws of the Protestant Church,\" etc. Dr. McCartee also assisted in putting the Ningpo system of Roman script into the final form which has made it such a help to the church in this whole district.  Dr. McCartee was a physician of unusual skill. He had made a reputation for scholarship before leaving America; and upon his arrival in China acquainted himself with the native practice and treatises on medicine. Hence the people, officials and wealthy classes, as well as the common people, had a wonderful confidence in his skill, which was only increased by the success of his treatment. His reputation spread throughout the whole Ningpo region, and whenever he went on his itinerations among the neighboring villages the people received him gladly. They not only entertained him, but willingly rented buildings for the opening of chapels. And converts not a few were the direct result of his medical and evangelistic work. Some who afterwards became useful preachers and teachers were reached in this way.  After the murder of Mr. Lowrie the American government wished Dr. McCartee  \u2022 Both are in constant and wide use yet\u2014J. E. S. to act as consul for Ningpo. He long declined, saying he had no time for any but his religious duties, but finally consented to take the office temporarily. All his dealings with the officials were most friendly; and he never lost an opportunity to explain the gospel to them in his interviews. It was probably in a good measure due to this perfect understanding that the officials of Ningpo have always been willing to protect the Christians in their jurisdiction.  When the new treaties of 1858 opened other ports, Dr. McCartee felt that God was opening doors for the gospel which ought to be entered at once. Accordingly, with a native helper, Zia Ying-tong, he moved to Chefoo, in July, 1862, and there remained three years; being afterwards joined by Dr. Nevius and others. Thus he was the first to open up this great work as well as that at Ningpo. He returned to Ningpo from the north in September, 1865. some time after the expulsion of the Tai-ping rebels from this place; and, after a furlough in the United States during 1869 and 1870, he was by December, 1870, here again.  Dr. McCartee one day met a man who had heard the gospel from Dr. Nevius in Hangchow, where he had been in business until the rebellion drove him to his home near Ningpo. Dr. McCartee took this man to his home, and treated him most cordially, instructing him more fully in the gospel. This opened the way for work in a village seven miles from Ningpo, out of which has grown the Kao-gyiao church. which now has sixty members and a large new building, erected almost entirely by the members themselves. When Rev. William Morrison gave up the church in Bao K6-tah in 1865, being compelled to return to America on account of failing health, the members desired Dr. McCartee to take charge of their church; which he accordingly did as their elder, walking the seven miles to and from Ningpo every Sabbath morning and evening, and thus bearing a strong testimony to the sanctity of the Sabbath day. He would not have another labor on that day merely to give him comfort.  I need not speak of his diligence and willingness to endure hardship, since everybody saw it for themselves. He was carrying on simultaneously four lines of work, either of which might have consumed all of one  man's time\u2014looking after a church, the consular office, literary work, medical work; and besides all this there were many consultations with other workers, both of his own and other missions. From morning till night there was not an idle moment. Even while at his meals he would be reading books and magazines. Because of this overwork and too much exposure to the sun, he was subject to spells of dizziness. In addition to all the above, were weekly trips to Chin-hae and Z-kyi, from which he often returned entirely exhausted; just as Paul says of himself in 2 Cor. xi. 27. Dr. McCartee had regular days and hours for dispensing medicine, but no one was ever sent away empty, no matter at what hour he came, nor did he ever refuse to answer a call, regardless of the distance or difficulties of the journey. Sometimes he would receive the sick into his own home, attending them in person, even sitting up with them through the night; nor did he make a difference in his treatment of Christians and outsiders, but showed the same consideration for all. He never went out but people along the way asked for medicine, and he always supplied them from his case.  His unfailing love was a great stimulus to all those with whom he came into contact One of the prominent traits in Dr. McCartee's character was his sympathy, especially toward fatherless children. In 1866 Mrs. Kying, wife of the pastor of the church in Yu-yiao, died of cholera, followed in a few days by her husband. Dr. McCartee took their little children, a boy of seven and a girl of two and brought them up as his own children. In the eleventh month of the same year the wife of one of the helpers suddenly died, leaving an infant son. Dr. McCartee happened to be present at the time, and wept with the sorrowing husband. Having wrapped the little one in one of his own garments he took it to a foster mother, who nourished and cared for it. In the churches at Ningpo, Kao-gyiao and Bao Ko-tah there were fatherless children brought to him almost every month, and he would find a place for them, paying for their keep from his own purse. This he did for many years, just as the Scripture says in Isa. IviiL 7. He had many boys in school who were orphans of Christians. Indeed fhose who shared his bounty were well nigh numberless. While at home on a furlough between 1869-1870, he raised funds to establish a hospital and an orphan asylum in Ningpo, but on his return to the field some dissension in the station hindered his purpose, and we in Ningpo were deprived of the blessing he had planned for us.  Dr. McCartee's home was always open to guests, and they accepted his hospitality in large numbers. His friendly ways both with foreigners and Chinese drew them to him like a magnet. Nor did his welcome fade with the passing days. In his treatment of his servants, too, his consideration was most marked, and they served with great faithfulness, unwilling to leave one who was more like a father than a master. Several of his servants became Christians, and all wept with genuine sorrow when he left Ningpo. I have already told of his care for the children of deceased Christians, nor was his care for the dead less notable. When about to leave Ningpo in 1869, he had stones put at the graves of all deceased Christians, saying, \"Now have I done my duty by the dead.\" Thus all his actions manifested love. When the end of life closed his labors, his parting message was, \"Give my love to all.\" This was all the legacy he left. His money had been used to do good during his lifetime, so that he had little laid by on earth, but he is now enjoying the treasure laid up in heaven, as promised in Matt. xxv. 40.  When Dr. McCartee returned to Ningpo in December, 1870, it was with the purpose of spending the rest of his days there, and he immediately set about arranging for the hospital and asylum, for which the funds had been raised, and the furnishings, medicines, etc., brought with him.  Difficulties arose in the station, and the opposition to his plan developed to such a strength that, with much sorrow of heart, he gave up his cherished plan, returned the money to the donors, and decided to leave Ningpo, which he did in January, 1872. A great crowd of foreigners and Chinese accompanied him to the steamer, many of them in tears. In his parting message to them the doctor said, as the tears streamed down his face: \"It was not my wish to leave you, but now I feel it is better for  me to go than to quarrel with my colleagues. Only my body goes, my heart remains with you. Stand firm in the Lord, my God and your God, my Father and your Father, and in the future we shall meet again in the Saviour's kingdom. This is my parting wish for you. May the Lord abide with you.\"  When he arrived in Shanghai the Consul General for the United States asked him to take the place of one of the consuls who was on sick leave, and this position he occupied for six months. At the end of that time he accepted a chair in the Imperial University of Japan, and prepared at once for his new work. Just as he was setting out for the journey there came a commission from the Chinese government empowering him to act as special envoy to Japan, to secure the release of certain coolies who had been kidnapped. He set out on this double mission in September, 1872. Having discharged his obligations to the Chinese government, he proceeded to Tokyo, and entered upon the duties of instructor in natural science, etc., in the university. His wisdom and learning were much praised by all who knew him, or studied in his classes. But as the story of his twentyeight years' work for Japan has been written in full I need not repeat it here.  The year after he left Ningpo, there came a letter from the Mission Board pointing out the station's mistake in its treatment of Dr. McCartee, and urging that the members of the station write to him, confessing the wrong done him, and asking him to return to Ningpo. This was done, but as a field of usefulness had already opened for him in Japan he decided to remain there. Yet, true to his parting word, his heart remained ever in Ningpo. He always delighted to meet any one from there, and missed no opportunity to send back greetings to hrs host of friends. Moreover, he continued through his life to send money for the aid of Bao K6-tah helping the people with their new building, and making an annual subscription to the pastor's salary, besides aiding in the support of sev eral poor dependents under the church's care. His love never failed while life lasted.  In October, 1899, he returned to his native land, on account of failing health, and took up his residence in San Francisco, Cal.  There on the 17th of July, 1900, his earthly labors ended at the ripe age of nearly eightyone. At his death, as in his life, his one thought was love. \"Divide my love among all\"\u2014was a true expression of the whole motive of his life. His love flowed out as the ceaseless flow of a river. Who has not been a sharer in it? As the Lord Jesus Himself, so this true servant became poor that others might be made rich. His only store was that laid up in heaven.  Though Dr. McCartee is dead, he yet lives even here. There are four ways in which he lives: (1) The books which he wrote are still being read, and in them he still speaks to men; (2) those who were helped by him are still here to proclaim his praises; (3) those who were his pupils are still here, living out his instructions\u2014his life is reproduced in them; (4) his example is fixed indelibly in the hearts of all who knew him, and stirs them with a desire to be such as he was. Is it not eminently true of Dr. McCartee as the Scripture says. \"He being dead yet speaketh\"?  At the meeting of the Ningpo Presbytery in the fall of 1900, when the death of Dr McCartee was reported, all were very sorrowfull, and expressed the hope that his life in Ningpo might be recorded in a permanent form, so that it might be known by succeeding generations. A committee was therefore appointed, consisting of Uoh Cong-eng, Lu Cing-veng and Su Me-lcah (Shoemaker), to prepare a biography with the hope that funds might be procured to have it printed. In accordance with the will of the presbytery this brief outline of Dr. McCartee's life has been drawn up, to help us remember him and follow his example of faithfulness to the Lord and love to men, knowing that if we follow earnestly his example we shall meet him at the Lord's side, and with him enjoy eternal bliss. This is our longing desire.  Signed by the Committee,  Uoh Cong-eng.

A correspondent of the Pr&byterian write* from Ningpo. China. Nov. <5:  The Presbytery of Ningpo held its annual meeting at Ningpo. commencing October 31st, and ending November 5th. The opening sermon was preached by the retiring Moderator. Rev. J. Butler, from Uaiab. 57; 15, after which the Rev. Baa Kwonghji was chosen Moderator.  On Monday evening, after prayer meeting, there was a regular meeting of Presbytery, at which time an account of the work in the different fields of labour was given by the members of Presbytery. The dark, as well as the bright side was brought out by almost every speaker, and the encouragements and discouragements of the work were set forth in such a way as to make the listener feel that the presbyters were anxiously desiring to fulfil the trust committed to them. Some of them reported additions to their churches, and also report*d a number of inquirers who were desiring of uniting with the church, noting the obstacles which were in the way of inquirers publicly confessing Christ.  Another interesting account was given of an opium smoker who was an anxious inquirer, but was not quite willing to endure the suffering which the casting off of his opium would bring upon him.  Another brother gave an account of an inquirer who kept a shop for the sale of idolatrous articles, who, by becoming a Christian, would have to give up his present means of livelihood.  Another related the case of a man who was secretary to the governor of the province, who wanted to unite with the church, but as his duties required his presence at the Yarnen all the morning, he was only able to keep half of the \"Lord's day,\" therefore was not admitted to church membership.  Another interesting case was narrated of an itinerant doctor who bad been an inquirer for some time, and had passed a very good examination before the session, but could not see his way clear to keep the Sabbath. He is obliged to be at his port on every market day, which sometimes occurs on the Sabbath, or he will lose his business. Many interesting cases were told of those who were willing to risk the loss of all things to gain Christ.  On Tuesday they bad a very interesting session, when several practical questions were discussed.  First. \"Marriages and Funerals.\" What can lie done to lessen the expenses connected with these two important events? The discussion was opened by Rev. Uoh Cang-eng.  He bemoaned the necessity for the great expenses connected with marriages and funerals, but could suggest no way out of the difficulty; possibly marriages might be brought about with less display, but as to funerals the Christians bad already, in many ways, curtailed the burial ceremonies, and he could not see that they could at present lessen expenses. He would, however, venture to suggest that Presbytery might fix a certain price to be paid for the bride\u2014say $48 as the minimum, and $60 as the maximum to be paid over to the parents of the girl. Another brother thought this sum too small, and suggested that $60 ah on id be the minimum and $100 the maximum price for a bride. One brother thought the fault lay mostly with the women, and it would be a good plan to exhort them to dispense with costly bridal ornaments and ex pensive outfits.  The Rev Zi Kyno jing said he had been able to persuade a few brides to give up certain expensive articles of dress and jewelry, and to appear plainer as becomes Christian women. The Rev. Yi Zing fah said that the maidens were most unwilling to dispense with what they considered a be coming outfit, and notwithstanding what was believed to the contrary, the youthful bride had somewhat to say as to what her outfit should be. She was determined to appear in what would be considered proper style, and if she could not, would burst into tears, and instead of the mirth of the marriage-feast they would hear the wailings of a funeral. Several of the brethren acknowledged that the heavy debts which most of them bore were the result of the expenses connected with marriages.  The second question was \"Occupation* for the Children of Native Christians.\" This was opened by the Rev. Zi Kyno jing, and was freely discussed. Many examples were cited to show what efforts had been made by Christian parents to secure work for their sons which would not involve them in heathen practices. In some instances arrangements were made with the employer, that if the boy should be allowed to keep the Sabbath his apprenticeship should continue for six months longer than the usual term, or the sum of money received at the end of his time should be less than that commonly received. One brother spoke of the difficulties connected with learning trades or being clerks. The custom is that the boys must perform the idolatrous service before the patron god, and an arrangement must be made to free the Icy from this duty. As there are plenty of heathen boys who would gladly perform this service, they, of course, are taken in preference to those who are unwilling to do this idolatrous work. The more genteel the employment the more idolatry was there connected with it, and the more menial the employment the fewer the obstacles there were connected with it. It was urged that all the boys should have some education enough, at least, to enable them to read the Scriptures.  The third question was, \"The Best Method for Securing Self support.\" It was opened by the Rev. Bao Kwonghyi. Mr. Bao urged the pastors to exhort the people to give. He was interrupted by an elder, who said, \"What! a pastor ask for his own support 1 that would be a hard thing to do. No,\" said he, \"a pastor cannot exhort the people to give to his own support.\" Mr. Bao replied, \"I think I shall exhort my people to give.\" I may remark that Mr. Fino's church shows that the pastor has exhorted his people to give, for in the matter of self support it is the best in the Presbytery. The rev. Uoh Cang eng thought the pastor should urge his people to give, and they should be told, before uniting with the church, that it was a Christian duty to give as God had prospered them. He thought some of the difficulty lay in the pastor having too much pity for his people, and too much fear of offending them. Mr. Uoh is pastor of a self-supporting church. The Rev. J. Butler reminded them that the money given was not to the pastor, nor to the poor, but to the Lord. A pastor must not appear before his people as a beggar, but as one who is teaching the Lord's will concerning his people. The Presbytery seemed quite stirred up on this subject, and alive to the fact that giving is a Christian duty.  The fourth subject was \"Foot-binding.\" The discussion was opened by Yu Kohtsing, who tried to set forth some of the disadvantages connected with the practice of foot binding. There was nothing to be said in its favor except that it was the custom to bind their daughters' feet. Some of the speakers could not see that it was any more sinful than some customs of foreign countries which are tolerated amongst Christians. Others thought it was at least a step in advance to agitate the subject, and referred to what had already been done by individuals in the direction of unbinding their daughters' feet. A number of cases could be pointed to where the wives and daughters had unbound feet, and hope was expressed that in a few years at least there would not be any bound feet amongst the Christians.  At the 3 o'clock P. M. a special meeting was held in view of the present stale of affairs in China. The burden of the prayers and exhortations was that, whatever the outcome of the war should be, God might be glorified and China become a Christian nation.\n|accessdate=8 December 2011}}()</ref>\n\nThe Status of the Presbyterian Mission in Ningbo in 1845 was stated as: \"Ningpo: on the Ningpo River, 12 miles from the sea; occupied as a Mission station, 1845- missionary laborers\u2014Rev.

The anti-foreign party may push matters to an extremity. They may think the present an opportune moment to carry out their policy, viz. the expulsion of foreigners; and outrages may be committed where there is no such pretence as that of which they availed themselves at Tien tsin. There is undoubtedly, along the coast, a very restless feeling, even in places which have been remarkably free from such disquietude. We may quote, in proof of this, the following letter from our Corresponding Secretary at Ningpo, the Rev.W. A. Russell, dated July 26 of the present year.  Since I last wrote to you we have been passing through one of those extraordinary panics, so many of which I had experienced in past years, but which I had hoped, from the unusual quietness which prevailed in this province since my return to China, were to be known amongst us no more. The cause of it has been the dreadful massacre which has taken place at Tien tsin. It has indeed been a most awful affair, such as I could scarcely have believed the Chinese capable of perpetrating. The singular feature of it is, that it should have been directed in such a marked way against the Roman Catholics and the French. This, no doubt, from some as yet unascertained cause, was the original programme; but when the work of destruction was once begun, the wonder is that it went no further. The shock of it naturally vibrated through every European community in China, from Peking to Hong Kong, and led at each place the evil-disposed to work upon the fears and hopes of the people, and to avail themselves of the opportunity to drive all foreigners out of China. For this purpose a most able but most inflammatory paper has been widely circulated among the readers of this province, and probably elsewhere. It purports to be a letter from Tseng-kwo-fan, the governor of the Chih-li province, to Mr. Wade, and deals at length with the three points of commercial intercourse, the propagation of Christianity, and the future independence of the Chinese Empire. It was so ably drawn up, and so calculated to produce the end it had in view, that I thought it wise to make a translation of it, and to send it to one of the Shanghae papers for publication, in order to show foreigners in China the steps that were being taken to excite the populace against them. It has certainly roused the people against us in this place in a most extraordinary way\u2014at one time almost to the verge of open violence; but happily just at present  things are beginning to assume a quieter aspect again. None of us have as yet left our posts; neither our dear brother, George Moule, who, with his family, are alone at Hangchow, nor Mr. Gretton, who has also firmly held on at Shaou-hying under most trying circumstances. I am in hopes that the storm will be weathered, although a good deal will depend upon the way in which the Tien tsin affair is settled, and that by the kind care and over-ruling providence of the Almighty, wo may be permitted still to go on with the prosecution of our work in this province. Our position, however, at present, is one of great danger and of great perplexity, needing the prayers and sympathies of our Christian friends in England, that we may he kept in this hour of trial, and have that faith in God, and that practical wisdom imparted unto us which wo now especially need.  In all probability the present crisis in China will be overruled, and that speedily, to further concessions to Europeans, and further openings for Missionary work throughout the Chinese Empire. Let us not, then, be fainthearted, but go forward in the full assurance of faith, that China, as well as the rest of the world, will be given to the Son for His inheritance, and that man's extremity is very often God's opportunity.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family. The Tichacek's temporarily lived in Mysl\u00edv where one of their sons Alois was born in 1857. Shortly afterwards, they also moved to St. Louis. Immigration slowed for a time in the 1860's because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]].\n\nMany of those who settled in Baltimore were participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.
