What was totally unacceptable to me, though, was the contemptuous way they treated people of lower classes and their own servants, while in our house servants were treated in the mildest possible manner,\" Benni remembered, according to his friend, writer [[Nikolai Leskov]]. Still without any books to aid, he came to the conclusion that at the root of all the injustice in the world around him was the economic and political system. He became friends with some Russian soldiers (simply in defiance of his Polish classmates, who hated them), learned from them of primal ways of collective ownership ([[obschina]], [[artel]]) and principles of mutual responsibility which existed in their country and, having formed in his mind his own, an idealistic concept of Russia, decided that was the land where his Socialist ideas could be put into practice.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nAfter leaving school Benni went to England to enroll at the technical college and, upon the graduation, joined the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich]] arsenal as an engineer.

The self-proclaimed revolutionaries' sympathiser, a Russian merchant named Tomashewski who happened to be in London, agreed to accompany the 22-year-old Benni on his mission. In [[Berlin]]<ref>Or in [[Saint Petersburgh]] according to [http://az.lib.ru/l/leskow_n_s/text_0028.shtml commentaries] to the 1957 Moscow 12 volume edition of ''Complete Leskov''.</ref> Tomashewski declared that their ways from then on were to part, or either he'd report him to the police. Unthwarted, Benni, a load of ''Kolokol'' with him, found himself in [[Saint Petersburg]] in the summer of 1861,<ref name=\"lit_dic\"/> still eager to \"serve the great cause of Russian liberation.\"<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n===Benni in Russia===\nIn the Russian capital Benni was befriended by a group of radicals ([[Nikolai Kurochkin]], [[Pavel Yakushkin]], Andrei Nichiporenko and others) who started referring to him as 'a Hertzen's envoy' (something Benni had never claimed to be) and instilling into him the idea that \"everything was ready in Russia for a revolt.\" Unimpressed, Benni demanded a demonstration of \"the revolutionary forces,\" but only five people came up, some by foot \"others by cabs so as to make retreat easier, just in case,\" as Leskov put it.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> Disillusioned with the 'revolutionary situation' in Saint Petersburgh, Benni with Nichiporenko, the ''Kolokol'' edition with them, embarked upon a trip to the province. Due to the latter's obnoxiousness, though, the pair has been thrown out of every house they tried to stay in, following their recommendation list. Finally, the two got in trouble with the local [[Cossacks]] and, after visiting the police, burnt their stack of ''Kolokol''. As Benni was trying to leave his troublesome companion behind, the latter retaliated: he returned to Saint Petersburgh with the theory of Benni being an \"English spy,\" backing his allegations by the stories of his \"suspicious behaviour\" which involved, among other things, refusing to participate in drunken sprees and sex orgies, and defending the local \"reactionaries\" whom Nechiporenko has made a habit of insulting in their own homes. The idea was eagerly accepted by the Petersburg \"revolutionaries\", now embarrassed and frightened by Benni's eagerness.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> Another project of Arthur Benni, that of collecting signatures under the Constitutional petition, addressed to the Tsar, failed too.<ref name=\"rulex\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Nichiporenko came to England, met Hertzen there and made a good enough impression to be employed by the latter as another 'envoy'. Burdened with a stack of ''Kolokol''{{'}} new issue, he was stopped at the Russian border, got arrested and was taken to the Russian capital for interrogation where he eagerly reported on every person he knew, including Benni and Leskov, as well as the others whom he'd never met, like [[Ivan Turgenev]]. By this time Benni become a member of ''[[Severnaya Ptchela]]'', a respectable newspaper where for the first time in Russia he found himself among people who treated him with respect and sympathy.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nFor some reason the women liberation movement activists in Russia preferred to involve their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in printing business which naturally made authorities, who were hunting the proclamations distributors, suspicious. \"There were few honest men in the capital who sincerely wanted to provide women with jobs at the time, and Benni was one of them,\" Leskov wrote.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> What the latter did first was to bring a group of women translators to the ''Severnaya ptchela'' editorial office, then took them to the Grech house in Saint Petersburgh, where they became known as The Grech commune. This enterprise proved inefficient: Bennihad to do all the work  himself and paid his employees from his own pocket. \n[[File:Kolokol200.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hertzen making a plea for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to help Benni, in his ''Kolokol'' newspaper]]\nAs the commune disintegrated, Benni brought the four type-setting machines into the house and invited four more female communards in. \"This enterprise was doomed, like all of the others he's been involved in, for Benni, whom simple men thought to be 'a scheming type', was, in fact, na\u00efve as a child. This tragicomic 'naturalized English subject' who came to Russia with the view of making social-democratic revolution\u2026 has demonstrated such inability to organize other people as to quickly turn this new business of his into a joke,\" Leskov commented. The commune proved a disaster. What was worse, by this time a bunch of male 'communards' have made his flat their home, spending the host's money, stealing his clothes and even driving him off, from time to time. Benni became seriously ill as a result of spending two sleepless nights in the open air on the banks of [[Neva]] embankment after a woman, thrown out of her home by husband, came to his flat and settled in his bedroom.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, another literary man, [[Vasily Sleptsov]], created the Znamensky commune. One of the workers there was Maria Kopteva, a girl from a respectable Moscow family, and Benni fell in love with her.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> Starting to look for a real job, Benni realised what his reputation of a \"spy\" meant in reality: none of the \"progressive\" press wanted him. Warmer was the reception in the centrist magazines, [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''Epokha'' and ''[[Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya]]'', led by [[Pyotr Boborykin]], who started to employ him as a stuff translator. In both magazines Benni was treated with sympathy and forged friendships \u2013 notably, with [[Nikolai Strakhov]] and Nikolai Voskoboinikov. In March 1862 Benni participated in the publication of the two issues of illegal ''Russkaya Pravda'' newspaper. [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' novel was published in 1864 by Boborykin in Arthur Benni's translation.<ref name=\"lit_dic\"/> By this time though, according to Leskov, \"he was a wasted, disillusioned man, taken to apathy\u2026 Even his love for a Russian girl failed to bring him happiness, in fact, it seemed to make him even more lost and misguided, his whole persona seemingly disintegrating under the emotional stress.\"<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nStarting to neglect his professional obligations, Benni soon lost his money and possessions, then became homeless. \"He was talking nonsensical things in those days, making plans to go to [[Siberia]] and free [[Chernyshevsky]], cried and prayed a lot,\" remembered Leskov, who's given him shelter. In the spring of 1863 Benni was arrested for debts in Leskov's [[Kolomna]] home and sent to a single cell in the Spassky jail. Pastor Hermann Benni sent in the money to pay his brother's debts, but by the time they came in, Benni has been considered already a political prisoner. Now part of the so-called 32 Process, or \"The Case of people accused of contacts with the London propagandists,\" he was accused of helping another Herzen's associate, [[Vasily Kelsiyev]], who came to Russia illegally and in March 1862 stayed at Benni's place (the fact Nichiporenko has reported to the authorities).\n\nThe Russian Senate sentenced him to three months imprisonment and deportation which was a mild sentence. Benni applied for the Russian citizenship but was refused. In jail he spent his time reading a lot, and reportedly, once confessed: \"Would you imagine, it is only now, as they are throwing me out of Russia, that I can see how ignorant I was\u2026 All my misfortunes here stem from the fact that I've failed to read ''[[Dead Souls]]'' in time. Had I done it, I'd be the first to dispute Herzen's idea of making revolution in Russia\". Asked why, he replied: \"Because no one can hope to instill any of the noble principles into the likes of Nozdryov and Tchichikov, ever.\"<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nIn October 1865 Benni was deported to [[Prussia]] and settled in [[Switzerland]]. It was there that he officially married Maria, the girl he was in love with. One article, \"The Russian Society\" which he published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' (1866, book III), showed that \"was still under the impression the revolution in Russia would be not only possible, but desirable,\" according to Leskov.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n===Death===\nIn the end of 1867 a small note appeared in ''Illustrirovannaya Gazeta'', edited by [[Vladimir Zotov]], according to which \"Arthur Benni, of whom different contradictory, mostly unfavourable rumors were being spread, has been killed in [[Mentana|Menton]].\" This story, short as it was, provided ground for a new rumour, that of Benni having been killed by a Garibaldi man, as a Russian spy. \"And the same industrious people, who could have been blamed for poor Benni's initial troubles, all of a sudden with unheard of energy started to support this new slander,\" Nikolai Leskov wrote in ''The Mystery Man''.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Benni's grave-board in the Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome.jpg|thumb|Arthur Benni's grave-board in the Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome]]\n\nIn June 1870, ''[[Nedelya]]'' (in Nos. 21\u201323) published the notes of [[Alexandra Jacobi]], who spent several months with Garibaldi men and was beside Benni all through November 1867. By the time of the [[Battle of Mentana|Battle at Mentana]], Benni has arrived to the Garibaldi camp, as a ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' correspondent.<ref name=\"lit_dic\"/> According to Jacobi, as the 9th regiment commander had been killed, Garibaldi's son Menotti asked Benni to take the leadership upon himself. He did, was injured in the right hand and on 4 November found himself in the Sant'Onofrio hospital in Rome, in the most awful conditions.<ref>According to the alternative account, credited to some 'private sources', Benni has been hit by a French cavalry man as he was walking by his small carriage, armless, fell and fainted, then was taken to the Garibaldi camp where gangrene developed.</ref> Alexandra Jacobi, assisted by an English priest, managed to transfer him to Sant'Agata hospital where conditions were better. What appeared to be a slight wound led to the amputation of the right hand, but even this proved to be too late.

Burdened with a stack of ''Kolokol''{{'}} new issue, he was stopped at the Russian border, got arrested and was taken to the Russian capital for interrogation where he eagerly reported on every person he knew, including Benni and Leskov, as well as the others whom he'd never met, like [[Ivan Turgenev]]. By this time Benni become a member of ''[[Severnaya Ptchela]]'', a respectable newspaper where for the first time in Russia he found himself among people who treated him with respect and sympathy.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nFor some reason the women liberation movement activists in Russia preferred to involve their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in printing business which naturally made authorities, who were hunting the proclamations distributors, suspicious. \"There were few honest men in the capital who sincerely wanted to provide women with jobs at the time, and Benni was one of them,\" Leskov wrote.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> What the latter did first was to bring a group of women translators to the ''Severnaya ptchela'' editorial office, then took them to the Grech house in Saint Petersburgh, where they became known as The Grech commune. This enterprise proved inefficient: Bennihad to do all the work  himself and paid his employees from his own pocket. \n[[File:Kolokol200.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hertzen making a plea for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to help Benni, in his ''Kolokol'' newspaper]]\nAs the commune disintegrated, Benni brought the four type-setting machines into the house and invited four more female communards in. \"This enterprise was doomed, like all of the others he's been involved in, for Benni, whom simple men thought to be 'a scheming type', was, in fact, na\u00efve as a child. This tragicomic 'naturalized English subject' who came to Russia with the view of making social-democratic revolution\u2026 has demonstrated such inability to organize other people as to quickly turn this new business of his into a joke,\" Leskov commented. The commune proved a disaster. What was worse, by this time a bunch of male 'communards' have made his flat their home, spending the host's money, stealing his clothes and even driving him off, from time to time. Benni became seriously ill as a result of spending two sleepless nights in the open air on the banks of [[Neva]] embankment after a woman, thrown out of her home by husband, came to his flat and settled in his bedroom.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, another literary man, [[Vasily Sleptsov]], created the Znamensky commune. One of the workers there was Maria Kopteva, a girl from a respectable Moscow family, and Benni fell in love with her.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> Starting to look for a real job, Benni realised what his reputation of a \"spy\" meant in reality: none of the \"progressive\" press wanted him. Warmer was the reception in the centrist magazines, [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''Epokha'' and ''[[Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya]]'', led by [[Pyotr Boborykin]], who started to employ him as a stuff translator. In both magazines Benni was treated with sympathy and forged friendships \u2013 notably, with [[Nikolai Strakhov]] and Nikolai Voskoboinikov. In March 1862 Benni participated in the publication of the two issues of illegal ''Russkaya Pravda'' newspaper. [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' novel was published in 1864 by Boborykin in Arthur Benni's translation.<ref name=\"lit_dic\"/> By this time though, according to Leskov, \"he was a wasted, disillusioned man, taken to apathy\u2026 Even his love for a Russian girl failed to bring him happiness, in fact, it seemed to make him even more lost and misguided, his whole persona seemingly disintegrating under the emotional stress.\"<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nStarting to neglect his professional obligations, Benni soon lost his money and possessions, then became homeless. \"He was talking nonsensical things in those days, making plans to go to [[Siberia]] and free [[Chernyshevsky]], cried and prayed a lot,\" remembered Leskov, who's given him shelter. In the spring of 1863 Benni was arrested for debts in Leskov's [[Kolomna]] home and sent to a single cell in the Spassky jail. Pastor Hermann Benni sent in the money to pay his brother's debts, but by the time they came in, Benni has been considered already a political prisoner. Now part of the so-called 32 Process, or \"The Case of people accused of contacts with the London propagandists,\" he was accused of helping another Herzen's associate, [[Vasily Kelsiyev]], who came to Russia illegally and in March 1862 stayed at Benni's place (the fact Nichiporenko has reported to the authorities).\n\nThe Russian Senate sentenced him to three months imprisonment and deportation which was a mild sentence. Benni applied for the Russian citizenship but was refused. In jail he spent his time reading a lot, and reportedly, once confessed: \"Would you imagine, it is only now, as they are throwing me out of Russia, that I can see how ignorant I was\u2026 All my misfortunes here stem from the fact that I've failed to read ''[[Dead Souls]]'' in time. Had I done it, I'd be the first to dispute Herzen's idea of making revolution in Russia\". Asked why, he replied: \"Because no one can hope to instill any of the noble principles into the likes of Nozdryov and Tchichikov, ever.\"<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\nIn October 1865 Benni was deported to [[Prussia]] and settled in [[Switzerland]]. It was there that he officially married Maria, the girl he was in love with. One article, \"The Russian Society\" which he published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' (1866, book III), showed that \"was still under the impression the revolution in Russia would be not only possible, but desirable,\" according to Leskov.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n===Death===\nIn the end of 1867 a small note appeared in ''Illustrirovannaya Gazeta'', edited by [[Vladimir Zotov]], according to which \"Arthur Benni, of whom different contradictory, mostly unfavourable rumors were being spread, has been killed in [[Mentana|Menton]].\" This story, short as it was, provided ground for a new rumour, that of Benni having been killed by a Garibaldi man, as a Russian spy. \"And the same industrious people, who could have been blamed for poor Benni's initial troubles, all of a sudden with unheard of energy started to support this new slander,\" Nikolai Leskov wrote in ''The Mystery Man''.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Benni's grave-board in the Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome.jpg|thumb|Arthur Benni's grave-board in the Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome]]\n\nIn June 1870, ''[[Nedelya]]'' (in Nos. 21\u201323) published the notes of [[Alexandra Jacobi]], who spent several months with Garibaldi men and was beside Benni all through November 1867. By the time of the [[Battle of Mentana|Battle at Mentana]], Benni has arrived to the Garibaldi camp, as a ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' correspondent.<ref name=\"lit_dic\"/> According to Jacobi, as the 9th regiment commander had been killed, Garibaldi's son Menotti asked Benni to take the leadership upon himself. He did, was injured in the right hand and on 4 November found himself in the Sant'Onofrio hospital in Rome, in the most awful conditions.<ref>According to the alternative account, credited to some 'private sources', Benni has been hit by a French cavalry man as he was walking by his small carriage, armless, fell and fainted, then was taken to the Garibaldi camp where gangrene developed.</ref> Alexandra Jacobi, assisted by an English priest, managed to transfer him to Sant'Agata hospital where conditions were better. What appeared to be a slight wound led to the amputation of the right hand, but even this proved to be too late. On 27 December (16 November or 27 November, according to other sources)<ref name=\"rulex\"/> Arthur Benni died in Rome, from complications of [[ergotism]] (according to other sources, [[gangrene]]).<ref name=\"mystery man\"/> Two days later he was buried at the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]] (now Non-Catholic Cemetery), his grave \"full of white and red flowers with green leaves, symbolizing Italy's colours\", according to Alexandra Jacobi.<ref name=\"mystery man\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography == \n* Eduard Kneifel, ''Tomaschower Pastorensohn \u2013 ein Revolution\u00e4r!

The club was named \"Shenyang\" (\u6c88\u9633). The team started at the bottom of the league system by playing in the second division. They were promoted to the [[Chinese Jia-A League 1988|1988 Chinese Jia-A League]] quickly after the league expanded and [[Liaoning Whowin F.C.|Liaoning FC]] was ineligible to field their reserve team in the same division. The club was relegated after only one season.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html#88 China League History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607124048/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html |date=2014-06-07 }} at rsssf.com. 22 Oct 2009.

The team were allowed to gather sponsorship and rename themselves '''Shenyang Liuyao''' (\u6c88\u9633\u4e1c\u5317\u516d\u836f), and were allowed to join the top tier due to their 1992 membership.<ref name=\"China 1994\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china94.html China League 1994<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727150541/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china94.html |date=2014-07-27 }} at rsssf.com. 19 Jun 2003.

Again the club won promotion to the top tier; however, unlike before they were able to avoid relegation. This was to be the beginning of the club's establishment within the league, though the team benefitted from several seasons where there was no relegation while the league expanded. In 2001 the club was taken over by Ginde Plastic Pipe Industry Group, a subsidiary of the Hongyuan Group and changed its name to '''Shenyang Ginde''' (\u6c88\u9633\u91d1\u5fb7). In 2007 the club's homeground [[Wulihe Stadium]] (\u4e94\u91cc\u6cb3\u4f53\u80b2\u573a) was demolished. While it was expected that the club move to another stadium within Shenyang, especially the [[Shenyang Olympic Sports Center Stadium]], a deal did not go through and the club moved to [[Changsha]] in [[Hunan]] and changed their name to '''Changsha Ginde''' (\u957f\u6c99\u91d1\u5fb7).\n\nAfter Changsha Ginde were relegated to League One at the end of the 2010 league season, the club was purchased by MAZAMBA and moved into the [[Shenzhen Stadium]] in the city of [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] in February 2011.

professional [[Association football|football]] club that plays in the [[Chinese Super League]] under licence from the [[Chinese Football Association]] (CFA).

They are owned by the Chinese property developers [[R&F Properties]] who took charge in June 2011. The club's English name R&F is short for \"Rich\" (\u5bcc) and \"Force\" (\u529b).\n\nThe club was founded in 1986 in [[Shenyang]] as Shenyang Football Team. They played at the 55,000-seat [[Wulihe Stadium]] (\u4e94\u91cc\u6cb3\u4f53\u80b2\u573a), until they moved to Changsha in 2007 to reside in the [[Helong Sports Center Stadium|Helong Stadium]].  American sportswear and sports equipment company MAZAMBA took over the club in 2010, and relocated the club to [[Shenzhen]] in February 2011. Their ownership was brief, and by June 2011 Chinese property developers Guangzhou R&F gained ownership of the club and moved them to Guangzhou. The club had their most successful season in 2014 as they finished third in the league and qualified for the [[2015 AFC Champions League]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/china-pr/csl/2014/regular-season/r23926/|title=Summary&nbsp;\u2013 CSL&nbsp;\u2013 China PR&nbsp;\u2013 Results, fixtures, tables and news&nbsp;\u2013 Soccerway|website=uk.soccerway.com|access-date=2016-03-12|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229010530/http://int.soccerway.com/national/china-pr/csl/2014/regular-season/r23926/|archivedate=2015-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1986 by the local [[Shenyang]] government sports body to take part in the Chinese football league system. The club was named \"Shenyang\" (\u6c88\u9633). The team started at the bottom of the league system by playing in the second division. They were promoted to the [[Chinese Jia-A League 1988|1988 Chinese Jia-A League]] quickly after the league expanded and [[Liaoning Whowin F.C.|Liaoning FC]] was ineligible to field their reserve team in the same division. The club was relegated after only one season.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html#88 China League History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607124048/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html |date=2014-06-07 }} at rsssf.com. 22 Oct 2009.

The team were allowed to gather sponsorship and rename themselves '''Shenyang Liuyao''' (\u6c88\u9633\u4e1c\u5317\u516d\u836f), and were allowed to join the top tier due to their 1992 membership.<ref name=\"China 1994\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china94.html China League 1994<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727150541/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china94.html |date=2014-07-27 }} at rsssf.com. 19 Jun 2003.

Again the club won promotion to the top tier; however, unlike before they were able to avoid relegation. This was to be the beginning of the club's establishment within the league, though the team benefitted from several seasons where there was no relegation while the league expanded. In 2001 the club was taken over by Ginde Plastic Pipe Industry Group, a subsidiary of the Hongyuan Group and changed its name to '''Shenyang Ginde''' (\u6c88\u9633\u91d1\u5fb7). In 2007 the club's homeground [[Wulihe Stadium]] (\u4e94\u91cc\u6cb3\u4f53\u80b2\u573a) was demolished. While it was expected that the club move to another stadium within Shenyang, especially the [[Shenyang Olympic Sports Center Stadium]], a deal did not go through and the club moved to [[Changsha]] in [[Hunan]] and changed their name to '''Changsha Ginde''' (\u957f\u6c99\u91d1\u5fb7).\n\nAfter Changsha Ginde were relegated to League One at the end of the 2010 league season, the club was purchased by MAZAMBA and moved into the [[Shenzhen Stadium]] in the city of [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] in February 2011.

informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms. Its historical background, growth and community life |first=Tello J. |last=D'Ap\u00e9ry| publisher= Magee Press| location=Philadelphia| year=1936| page=4| url=http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/PDFs_Misc/OverbrookFarms_Apery_1936.pdf#page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the [[Main Line of Public Works]] that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]].

Society, William Morrison Collection'')|279x279px]]\n\nThe '''Philadelphia Main Line''', known simply as the '''Main Line''', is an informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms. Its historical background, growth and community life |first=Tello J. |last=D'Ap\u00e9ry| publisher= Magee Press| location=Philadelphia| year=1936| page=4| url=http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/PDFs_Misc/OverbrookFarms_Apery_1936.pdf#page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the [[Main Line of Public Works]] that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]]. As such, communities west along the Main Line to Thorndale or even as far west as Parkesburg are considered to be a part of the Main Line.\n\n==Demographics==\nThere is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by [[ZIP code]]. In comparison, the median family income and home price for the state of Pennsylvania are $68,646 and $155,000, respectively.<ref>[http://www.brainyzip.com BrainyZip]</ref><ref>[http://www.zip-codes.com Zip-codes.com]</ref> The following ZIP codes are those within the previously mentioned municipalities that make up the Main Line.

It was the main city of the Faliscans, a people whose language was [[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] and was part of the [[Latino-Faliscan]] language group. The Ager Faliscus (Faliscan Country), which included the towns of [[Capena]], Nepet ([[Nepi]]) and Sutrium (Sutri), was close to the [[Monti Cimini]].\n\n== History  ==\nAccording to legend, it was of [[Argive]] origin. [[Strabo]]'s assertion that the population, the [[Falisci]], were of a different race from the [[Etruscans]] is supported by the evidence of the [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] which have been found here. They were written in a Latin dialect. Most of the surviving inscriptions date back to the second half of the fourth century BC and the first half of the third century BC. The Faliscan language survived \"the domination of the [surrounding] Etruscan culture, as well as, for a long time, the expansion of the Romans.\" <ref name=\"Bakkum2008\">{{cite book|author=Gabri\u00ebl C.

For this reason, they supported the Etruscan cities of Veii and [[Fidenae]] (which was near Veii, on the other bank of the river) in their conflicts with Rome in the fifth century.  Livy noted that: \u201cAs these two States [Falerii and the nearby Capena] were nearest in point of distance, they believed that if Veii fell they would be the next on whom Rome would make war.\u201d  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.8.5</ref> There had been a history of on-and-off conflicts between Rome and Veii, which often involved Fidenae. The Romans had placed a colony at Fidenae to garrison the city.  In 437 BC Fidenae revolted, attacked the Roman settlers and sided with Veii. Romans envoys who were sent to Fidenae were killed on the order of the king of Veii. The Romans advanced on Fidenae. The Faliscans sent troops in support. The Veientes and Fidenates (the inhabitants of Veii and Fidenae) wanted to prolong the war, but the Fidenates wanted a pitched battle. The Romans routed the combined enemy forces. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.17.11, 19.6</ref> In 436 BC the Romans raided the territory of Veii and Falerii, but did not attack the two cities. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.21.1-2 </ref> In 435 BC the Fidenates crossed into Roman territory to raid it and called in the army of Veii. Falerii did not want to renew the war. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.21.8 </ref> In 434 the Romans seized Fidenae. This alarmed Veii and Falerii. They sent envoys to the Etruscan League (a council of the twelve major Etruscan cities, also called the  which proclaimed a council for all Etruria. However, the council refused to help Veii. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.23.4-5, 24.1</ref>\n\nIn 403 BC war broke out between Rome and Veii. The Romans begun a siege which lasted until 396 BC when they seized and destroyed this city. In 402 BC Falerii and Capena bound themselves by an oath and sent troops to Veii. They attacked the smaller the two Roman camps from the rear. The Veientes attacked the Roman siege works form the front. The lack of unity between the Roman commanders led to a rout of the Romans, and the capture of the smaller camp. Some Romans escaped to the larger camp and some withdrew to Rome. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.8.4-13</ref> In 400 BC the Romans recaptured the lost camp, raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, but did not attack the two cities. In 399 BC Falerii and Capena sent troops to relieve Veii. The Romans made a sortie from their camp, put their forces to flight and pursued them killed many of their men. Soon after this a contingent was sent to raid the territory of Capena. It fell on the survivors of the battle and destroyed them. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.12.4-5, 13.8-12</ref> In 398 BC The Romans raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, \"carried off huge spoils and left nothing untouched that iron or fire could destroy.\" <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.14.7</ref> Livy mentioned Roman campaigns against Veii, of Falerii, and of Capena in 397 BC, but did not give any details. He wrote that the campaign at Veii was indecisive.  <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.16.2, 8</ref> In that year the Etruscan League held a council \"where the Capenates and Faliscans proposed that all the nations of Etruria should unite in a common resolution 'and design to raise the siege of Veii.\" However, the request was refused because Veii had not consulted the other Etruscan cities \"for advice in so weighty a matter.\" Moreover, \"[t]here was now in the greatest part of Etruria a strange race, new settlers, with whom they were neither securely at peace nor yet certain to have war.\" This must have been a reference to the Gauls who had invaded northern Italy, close to Etruria. The council allowed Etruscan men to volunteer to serve in the war and many men did so. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.17.6-10</ref> In 396 BC two Roman commanders marched against Falerii and Capena. However, they were poor commanders and fell into an ambush. One of them fell and the other withdrew.  There was a rumour that Faliscans and Capenates were advancing and getting close to Veii \"with the whole military strength of Etruria.\" This caused panic in Rome. This led to a Roman push at Veii, which was captured and destroyed. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.18.7-12, 19</ref> In 395 BC the Romans conducted operations against Falerii and Capena. They did not attack the cities. They ravaged the countryside and \"despoiled the farmers of their possessions, leaving not one fruit-tree in the land nor any productive plant.\" Capena sued for peace, but the war with Falerii continued. 5.24.1-2\n\nIn 394 BC the war with Falerii was entrusted to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]]. He forced the Faliscans to come out of their town by ravaging the fields and burning the farmhouses. They encamped only one mile from the town, on a spot which they thought was safe because it was difficult to access. Guided by Faliscan prisoners, Camillus placed himself in a superior position near the camp. Enemy forces which tried to hinder the work were routed and the Faliscans fled back to their city. Camillus proceeded to besiege it. The town had plenty of food supplies and the siege seemed a prolonged affair. The inhabitants carried on with their usual lives and their boys went to school. The Faliscans had adopted the Greek practice of entrusting  their boys to one tutor. This tutor decided to betray the town. He led the boys out of the town daily to exercise them. At first he kept them close to the city walls. Then he ventured further out. Eventually he reached the Roman outposts and handed the boys to the enemy. He communicated to Camillus his intention to betray Falerii. Camillus ordered that the man be stripped, scourged and driven back into the city by the boys. When the Faliscans saw the tutor coming back in this fashion, they admired the righteousness of Camillus and sent envoys to him, \"entrusting him with their lives and fortunes.\u201d Camillus sent them to Rome and they told the senate that \u201cthe Romans, by esteeming righteousness above victory, had taught them to love defeat above freedom and considered themselves \u201cvanquished in virtue.\u201d <ref>Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Camillus 9-10 </ref> According to Livy they also promised fidelity to Roman rule. The senate entrusted the matter to Camillus who demanded the town to pay the wages of the Roman soldiers for that year. In Livy's account he granted peace; in [[Plutarch]]'s he \u201cestablished friendship with all the Faliscans.\" He then went back to Rome. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.27</ref>\n\nIn 359 BC war broke out between Rome and the Etruscan city-state of Tarquinii because the latter plundered Roman territory adjoining Etruria. In 357 BC Faliscan men joined the Tarquinenses and refused to hand back Roman prisoners they had taken to Falerii. Livy wrote that the consul Gnaeus Manlius accomplished very little and mentioned that he was encamped at Sutrium, in Faliscan territory. In 356 BC the Romans engaged the Faliscans and Tarquinenses. The priests of the latter rushed towards the Romans carrying snakes and torches. This dismayed the Roman soldiers, who fled to their rampart. They were mocked by their officers and they rushed against the enemy, routed them and seized their camp. All Etruscans then rose in arms led by Tarquinii and Falerii and advanced as far as the Roman salt works at the mouth of the River Tiber. The Romans crossed the river on rafts. They caught straggling pillagers in the fields and sized the enemy camp by surprise. The enemy was driven out of Roman territory.  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 7.12.5, 16.2, 7, 17.2-10</ref> In 365 BC another Etruscan city, [[Caere]], joined Tarquinii. It was defeated and granted a 100-year truce. The Faliscans were accused of participating in the war and the brunt of the war was turned against them. The Romans could not find their forces and pillaged their land. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome 19.6, 20.9</ref> In 351 BC the Romans conducted a campaign against Tarquinii and Falerii, ravaging their fields until their resistance was broken. The two city-states requested a truce and a forty-year truce was granted. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.22.4-5</ref> In 342 BC the Roman victory over the [[Samnites]] in the [[First Samnite War]] (344-342 BC) induced Falerii to ask Rome to  convert their forty years' truce into a permanent treaty of peace. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.38.1</ref>\n\nIn the first years of the [[Third Samnite War]] (298-290 BC), when Etruscans city-states rose against Rome, the Faliscans remained loyal to Rome. In 298 BC, after a fight with Volerrae ([[Volterra]]), a city-state in northern Etruria, the Romans went to the Faliscan territory, left their baggage in Falerii and proceeded to ravage enemy territory. In 297 BC envoys for the Faliscan cities of Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii went to Rome to inform the Romans that the city assemblies of Etruria were discussing suing for peace. In 295 BC, before the [[Battle of Sentinum]], where the Romans faced a combined force of Samnites, Etruscans, [[Umbrians]] and [[Senones|Senone]] Gauls, the Romans stationed a reserve army in Faliscan territory.  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 10.12.3-7, 14.3, 26.15</ref> However, in 293 BC the Faliscans made common cause with the Etruscans. Rome declared war on them. They seized the city of Troilum and then took five strong fortresses by storm.

It was the main city of the Faliscans, a people whose language was [[Faliscan]] and was part of the [[Latino-Faliscan]] language group. The Ager Faliscus (Faliscan Country), which included the towns of [[Capena]], Nepet ([[Nepi]]) and Sutrium (Sutri), was close to the [[Monti Cimini]].\n\n== History  ==\nAccording to legend, it was of [[Argive]] origin. [[Strabo]]'s assertion that the population, the [[Falisci]], were of a different race from the [[Etruscans]] is supported by the evidence of the [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] which have been found here. They were written in a Latin dialect. Most of the surviving inscriptions date back to the second half of the fourth century BC and the first half of the third century BC. The Faliscan language survived \"the domination of the [surrounding] Etruscan culture, as well as, for a long time, the expansion of the Romans.\" <ref name=\"Bakkum2008\">{{cite book|author=Gabri\u00ebl C.

For this reason, they supported the Etruscan cities of Veii and [[Fidenae]] (which was near Veii, on the other bank of the river) in their conflicts with Rome in the fifth century.  Livy noted that: \u201cAs these two States [Falerii and the nearby Capena] were nearest in point of distance, they believed that if Veii fell they would be the next on whom Rome would make war.\u201d  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.8.5</ref> There had been a history of on-and-off conflicts between Rome and Veii, which often involved Fidenae. The Romans had placed a colony at Fidenae to garrison the city.  In 437 BC Fidenae revolted, attacked the Roman settlers and sided with Veii. Romans envoys who were sent to Fidenae were killed on the order of the king of Veii. The Romans advanced on Fidenae. The Faliscans sent troops in support. The Veientes and Fidenates (the inhabitants of Veii and Fidenae) wanted to prolong the war, but the Fidenates wanted a pitched battle. The Romans routed the combined enemy forces. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.17.11, 19.6</ref> In 436 BC the Romans raided the territory of Veii and Falerii, but did not attack the two cities. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.21.1-2 </ref> In 435 BC the Fidenates crossed into Roman territory to raid it and called in the army of Veii. Falerii did not want to renew the war. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.21.8 </ref> In 434 the Romans seized Fidenae. This alarmed Veii and Falerii. They sent envoys to the Etruscan League (a council of the twelve major Etruscan cities, also called the  which proclaimed a council for all Etruria. However, the council refused to help Veii. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 4.23.4-5, 24.1</ref>\n\nIn 403 BC war broke out between Rome and Veii. The Romans begun a siege which lasted until 396 BC when they seized and destroyed this city. In 402 BC Falerii and Capena bound themselves by an oath and sent troops to Veii. They attacked the smaller the two Roman camps from the rear. The Veientes attacked the Roman siege works form the front. The lack of unity between the Roman commanders led to a rout of the Romans, and the capture of the smaller camp. Some Romans escaped to the larger camp and some withdrew to Rome. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.8.4-13</ref> In 400 BC the Romans recaptured the lost camp, raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, but did not attack the two cities. In 399 BC Falerii and Capena sent troops to relieve Veii. The Romans made a sortie from their camp, put their forces to flight and pursued them killed many of their men. Soon after this a contingent was sent to raid the territory of Capena. It fell on the survivors of the battle and destroyed them. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.12.4-5, 13.8-12</ref> In 398 BC The Romans raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, \"carried off huge spoils and left nothing untouched that iron or fire could destroy.\" <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.14.7</ref> Livy mentioned Roman campaigns against Veii, of Falerii, and of Capena in 397 BC, but did not give any details. He wrote that the campaign at Veii was indecisive.  <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.16.2, 8</ref> In that year the Etruscan League held a council \"where the Capenates and Faliscans proposed that all the nations of Etruria should unite in a common resolution 'and design to raise the siege of Veii.\" However, the request was refused because Veii had not consulted the other Etruscan cities \"for advice in so weighty a matter.\" Moreover, \"[t]here was now in the greatest part of Etruria a strange race, new settlers, with whom they were neither securely at peace nor yet certain to have war.\" This must have been a reference to the Gauls who had invaded northern Italy, close to Etruria. The council allowed Etruscan men to volunteer to serve in the war and many men did so. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.17.6-10</ref> In 396 BC two Roman commanders marched against Falerii and Capena. However, they were poor commanders and fell into an ambush. One of them fell and the other withdrew.  There was a rumour that Faliscans and Capenates were advancing and getting close to Veii \"with the whole military strength of Etruria.\" This caused panic in Rome. This led to a Roman push at Veii, which was captured and destroyed. <ref>Livy The History of Rome, 5.18.7-12, 19</ref> In 395 BC the Romans conducted operations against Falerii and Capena. They did not attack the cities. They ravaged the countryside and \"despoiled the farmers of their possessions, leaving not one fruit-tree in the land nor any productive plant.\" Capena sued for peace, but the war with Falerii continued. 5.24.1-2\n\nIn 394 BC the war with Falerii was entrusted to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]]. He forced the Faliscans to come out of their town by ravaging the fields and burning the farmhouses. They encamped only one mile from the town, on a spot which they thought was safe because it was difficult to access. Guided by Faliscan prisoners, Camillus placed himself in a superior position near the camp. Enemy forces which tried to hinder the work were routed and the Faliscans fled back to their city. Camillus proceeded to besiege it. The town had plenty of food supplies and the siege seemed a prolonged affair. The inhabitants carried on with their usual lives and their boys went to school. The Faliscans had adopted the Greek practice of entrusting  their boys to one tutor. This tutor decided to betray the town. He led the boys out of the town daily to exercise them. At first he kept them close to the city walls. Then he ventured further out. Eventually he reached the Roman outposts and handed the boys to the enemy. He communicated to Camillus his intention to betray Falerii. Camillus ordered that the man be stripped, scourged and driven back into the city by the boys. When the Faliscans saw the tutor coming back in this fashion, they admired the righteousness of Camillus and sent envoys to him, \"entrusting him with their lives and fortunes.\u201d Camillus sent them to Rome and they told the senate that \u201cthe Romans, by esteeming righteousness above victory, had taught them to love defeat above freedom and considered themselves \u201cvanquished in virtue.\u201d <ref>Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Camillus 9-10 </ref> According to Livy they also promised fidelity to Roman rule. The senate entrusted the matter to Camillus who demanded the town to pay the wages of the Roman soldiers for that year. In Livy's account he granted peace; in [[Plutarch]]'s he \u201cestablished friendship with all the Faliscans.\" He then went back to Rome. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.27</ref>\n\nIn 359 BC war broke out between Rome and the Etruscan city-state of Tarquinii because the latter plundered Roman territory adjoining Etruria. In 357 BC Faliscan men joined the Tarquinenses and refused to hand back Roman prisoners they had taken to Falerii. Livy wrote that the consul Gnaeus Manlius accomplished very little and mentioned that he was encamped at Sutrium, in Faliscan territory. In 356 BC the Romans engaged the Faliscans and Tarquinenses. The priests of the latter rushed towards the Romans carrying snakes and torches. This dismayed the Roman soldiers, who fled to their rampart. They were mocked by their officers and they rushed against the enemy, routed them and seized their camp. All Etruscans then rose in arms led by Tarquinii and Falerii and advanced as far as the Roman salt works at the mouth of the River Tiber. The Romans crossed the river on rafts. They caught straggling pillagers in the fields and sized the enemy camp by surprise. The enemy was driven out of Roman territory.  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 7.12.5, 16.2, 7, 17.2-10</ref> In 365 BC another Etruscan city, [[Caere]], joined Tarquinii. It was defeated and granted a 100-year truce. The Faliscans were accused of participating in the war and the brunt of the war was turned against them. The Romans could not find their forces and pillaged their land. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome 19.6, 20.9</ref> In 351 BC the Romans conducted a campaign against Tarquinii and Falerii, ravaging their fields until their resistance was broken. The two city-states requested a truce and a forty-year truce was granted. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.22.4-5</ref> In 342 BC the Roman victory over the [[Samnites]] in the [[First Samnite War]] (344-342 BC) induced Falerii to ask Rome to  convert their forty years' truce into a permanent treaty of peace. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 5.38.1</ref>\n\nIn the first years of the [[Third Samnite War]] (298-290 BC), when Etruscans city-states rose against Rome, the Faliscans remained loyal to Rome. In 298 BC, after a fight with Volerrae ([[Volterra]]), a city-state in northern Etruria, the Romans went to the Faliscan territory, left their baggage in Falerii and proceeded to ravage enemy territory. In 297 BC envoys for the Faliscan cities of Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii went to Rome to inform the Romans that the city assemblies of Etruria were discussing suing for peace. In 295 BC, before the [[Battle of Sentinum]], where the Romans faced a combined force of Samnites, Etruscans, [[Umbrians]] and [[Senones|Senone]] Gauls, the Romans stationed a reserve army in Faliscan territory.  <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 10.12.3-7, 14.3, 26.15</ref> However, in 293 BC the Faliscans made common cause with the Etruscans. Rome declared war on them. They seized the city of Troilum and then took five strong fortresses by storm. The Faliscans sued for peace and were granted a one-year truce after paying an indemnity of 100,000 [[As (Roman coin)|asses]] of bronze coinage and year's pay for the troops of the consul who campaigned in Etruria. <ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 10.45.6-8, 26.10-12</ref>\n\nDrawing on the work of [[Cassius Dio]], [[Zonaras]] wrote that in 241 BC the Romans made war of Falerii. In a first battle the Romans heavy infantry was defeated, but the Faliscan cavalry lost. The Romans won a second battle and the Faiscans' arms, cavalry, goods, slaves and half of their territory.

Early uses of the term include the 1925 [[jazz]] recording by [[Johnny Bayersdorffer]]'s Jazzola Novelty Orchestra entitled \"I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Riding Now\" (later covered by [[Mae West]]) and \"Mama Don't Allow No Easy Riders Here\" in 1929 by [[Tampa Red]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n===Great Depression===\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] a large population of Americans driven by poverty rode the railroad system and the term easy rider (along with [[hobo]] and [[Homelessness|bum]]) found its way into slang vocabulary to mean a slow moving train and the men that, even after the great depression, continued to live and travel along the rails. The majority of these trains, commissioned in the early 1920s, had the letters C.C. (for [[Colorado Central]]) or S.C. (for Southern Coastal) stenciled on them in bold white letters. This is most likely where the term C.C. rider originated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===World War II===\nIn the [[World War II]] era the slang term re-emerged with a modified meaning, where [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] on extended deployment in Asia or Europe (unofficially) employed children to perform the daily mundane tasks so common in the military like tending to barracks, shining boots, and the like, so a G.I. who employed a [[houseboy]] coasted through this work and had an \"easy ride\".\n\nEventually young native women were hired to tend to individual living quarters and soon became lovers as well as maids.\n\nWhen these men left and other G.I.s took their place, the women, accustomed to the workload, would remain to perform the same services, sometimes preparing gear or a living area for inspection better than the soldier could.\n\n===1960s===\n\nThe term had a different meaning in the \"[[free love]]\" cultural era of the 1960s and was first applied to women who practiced free love. A man who lived with this type of woman had a free or easy ride, since the woman still did most of the chores even though [[Second-wave feminism]] began to have a major influence on women at this time.\n\nThe term soon acquired a negative connotation however as it became a derogatory way to describe a woman with whom a [[hippie]] could live, then leave abruptly and who would not get angry if he came back later. Soon it was applied to prostitutes whom it was easy to fool or steal from or who simply traded their charms for a small amount of food or drugs.\n\n==Effects on entertainment==\nThe term appears in the famous \"[[See See Rider Blues]]\" song recorded by Ma Rainey in 1925. The song and others like it used the loneliness of a rider of the rails or wanderer as a theme in their music.\n\nThe 1969 movie ''[[Easy Rider]]'' had wandering motorcycle riders as its characters, and due to the notoriety of the movie the term again acquired another meaning to fit into the cultural mores of the time to mean a good, usually [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle.\n\n[[Dennis Hopper]], the director of ''Easy Rider'', said in the making-of documentary [[Shaking the Cage]]:\n\"An easy rider is a person that is not a pimp, but he lives off a woman; he lives off a whore.  He's her easy rider.  He's the one that she loves and she gives money to.  He doesn't pimp her, but he's her easy rider.\"\n\n[[Led Zeppelin]], although a rock band, was heavily influenced by early jazz and blues and make reference in numerous songs to an \"easy rider.\" Most notably the song \"[[Out on the Tiles]]\" makes reference to this free love practice and the cultural impact of it as he is both proud and ashamed to be seen with a woman known to be an \"easy rider\" while at the same time trying to hitchhike a ride.\n\nAfter contributing his own music to the motion picture ''Easy Rider'', [[Jimi Hendrix]] was inspired to write a song of the same name on his album [[The Cry of Love]] originally released in 1971.

Early uses of the term include the 1925 [[jazz]] recording by [[Johnny Bayersdorffer]]'s Jazzola Novelty Orchestra entitled \"I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Riding Now\" (later covered by [[Mae West]]) and \"Mama Don't Allow No Easy Riders Here\" in 1929 by [[Tampa Red]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n===Great Depression===\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] a large population of Americans driven by poverty rode the railroad system and the term easy rider (along with [[hobo]] and [[Homelessness|bum]]) found its way into slang vocabulary to mean a slow moving train and the men that, even after the great depression, continued to live and travel along the rails. The majority of these trains, commissioned in the early 1920s, had the letters C.C. (for [[Colorado Central]]) or S.C. (for Southern Coastal) stenciled on them in bold white letters. This is most likely where the term C.C. rider originated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===World War II===\nIn the [[World War II]] era the slang term re-emerged with a modified meaning, where [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] on extended deployment in Asia or Europe (unofficially) employed children to perform the daily mundane tasks so common in the military like tending to barracks, shining boots, and the like, so a G.I. who employed a [[houseboy]] coasted through this work and had an \"easy ride\".\n\nEventually young native women were hired to tend to individual living quarters and soon became lovers as well as maids.\n\nWhen these men left and other G.I.s took their place, the women, accustomed to the workload, would remain to perform the same services, sometimes preparing gear or a living area for inspection better than the soldier could.\n\n===1960s===\n\nThe term had a different meaning in the \"[[free love]]\" cultural era of the 1960s and was first applied to women who practiced free love. A man who lived with this type of woman had a free or easy ride, since the woman still did most of the chores even though [[Second-wave feminism]] began to have a major influence on women at this time.\n\nThe term soon acquired a negative connotation however as it became a derogatory way to describe a woman with whom a [[hippie]] could live, then leave abruptly and who would not get angry if he came back later. Soon it was applied to prostitutes whom it was easy to fool or steal from or who simply traded their charms for a small amount of food or drugs.\n\n==Effects on entertainment==\nThe term appears in the famous \"[[See See Rider Blues]]\" song recorded by Ma Rainey in 1925. The song and others like it used the loneliness of a rider of the rails or wanderer as a theme in their music.\n\nThe 1969 movie ''[[Easy Rider]]'' had wandering motorcycle riders as its characters, and due to the notoriety of the movie the term again acquired another meaning to fit into the cultural mores of the time to mean a good, usually [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle.\n\n[[Dennis Hopper]], the director of ''Easy Rider'', said in the making-of documentary [[Shaking the Cage]]:\n\"An easy rider is a person that is not a pimp, but he lives off a woman; he lives off a whore.  He's her easy rider.  He's the one that she loves and she gives money to.  He doesn't pimp her, but he's her easy rider.\"\n\n[[Led Zeppelin]], although a rock band, was heavily influenced by early jazz and blues and make reference in numerous songs to an \"easy rider.\" Most notably the song \"[[Out on the Tiles]]\" makes reference to this free love practice and the cultural impact of it as he is both proud and ashamed to be seen with a woman known to be an \"easy rider\" while at the same time trying to hitchhike a ride.\n\nAfter contributing his own music to the motion picture ''Easy Rider'', [[Jimi Hendrix]] was inspired to write a song of the same name on his album [[The Cry of Love]] originally released in 1971. The spelling of the song title was altered to \"Ezy Ryder,\" possibly indicating that the person in the song is named Ezy Ryder.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Slang]]\n", "name_user": "97.116.163.114", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e1900s)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_rider_(slang)"}

The Italian invasion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n{{see also|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian East Africa}}\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the foundation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), formed from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland]], and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], conquered in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain. The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine and feared a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall the British, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter a British intervention. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar, by defeating the garrison and occupying British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the Assa Hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 03.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a Savoia-Marchetti SM 81}}]]\nOn 31 July 18\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglie}} arrived at the Scelene airstrip near [[Dire Dawa]] with six [[Caproni Ca.133|Ca 133]] bomber/transport aircraft. On 1 August {{lang|it|Comando Tattico dell Settore Aeronautica Ouest}} (CTSAO, Western Sector Tactical Command) was created for the invasion of British Somaliland. At first the CTSAO ({{lang|it|Generale}} Collalti) had 27 bombers, 23 fighters and seven reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=45}} During the afternoon, flights of three [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|SM 81]] bombers each, attacked shipping off [[Zeila]] as two waves of six Blenheim Mk Is from 8 and 39 squadrons, escorted by two 203 Squadron Blenheim IVFs, bombed the Italian airfield at Chinele, which had been discovered that morning. The Blenheims dived to {{cvt|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}} through anti-aircraft fire as [[Fiat CR.42|CR 42]] fighters of 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglie}} scrambled from Dire Dawa ({{cvt|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} away) and attacked the Blenheim IVFs. As the second wave of six Blenheims arrived, {{lang|it|Captaino}} Corrado Ricci, the commander of 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglie}}, took off in his [[Fiat CR.32|CR 32]] and shot one down. As the Blenheims flew home over Zeila, the crews spotted a flight of the SM 81 bombers attacking the port. Three Blenheims broke formation and shot down one of the Italian bombers.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary.

The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Kerim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}} During the morning of 9 August, three Italian fighters strafed the airfield at Berbera but found only a damaged Blenheim.

The Gladiator damaged the day before was dismantled and taken to Aden.

Early in the morning 8 Squadron sent three Blenheims to dive bomb Italian troops at Tug Argan, one being damaged by a CR 42. In the afternoon another three Blenheims bombed the village of Dubato; two of the Blenheims collided on the return journey and crashed in flames. On 11 August a morning attack was made by Six Ca 133s and three SM 81s on the Godojere Pass, a SM 81 being shot down by ground fire. Three CR 42s strafed Laferug and a SM 79 bombed the airstrip afterwards. A Blenheim was claimed shot down by Italian troops but no loss appeared in British records.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=48}}\n\nOn 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} At dawn a couple of Blenheims from 11 and 39 squadrons from Aden bombed Italian artillery around Darbouruk against anti-aircraft fire then the 11 Squadron Blenheim was bounced by a CR 42 and damaged while the crew were trying to drop a message for British troops. The 39 Squadron machine was also attacked and made an emergency landing at Berbera. About two hours later three 39 Squadron Blenheims arrived to repeat the attack and the formation leader was attacked by a 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}} CR 32. The pilot of the third Blenheim saw the attack, jettisoned bombs and attacked the Italian fighter, which made a head-on attack, wounding the Blenheim pilot and killed the observer. The pilot managed to reach Berbera and crash-land; the Italian pilot was also wounded. During the attack, a Blenheim IVF of 203 Squadron patrolled Berbera and tried to intercept three SM 79s but broke off the pursuit when a hit in the cockpit, wounded the pilot and navigator. Italian aircraft provided ground support all day, six Ca 133s bombing Mandera and Laferug.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nOn 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap. On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August the aircraft of CTSAO concentrated on the area to the east of Adadleh; the Jerato Pass was bombed by Ca 233s and the crashed Blenheims at Berbera were strafed twice by CR 32s, one on the second attack being hit by small-arms fire and landing inside British-held territory. Another three SM 81s were transferred from [[Shashamane]] (south of Addis Ababa) to Dire Dawa. Italian outflanking moves at Tug Argan led the British to begin a withdrawal to Berbera. Eleven [[Vickers Wellesley|Wellesleys]] of 223 Squadron were sent to reinforce the RAF at Aden.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn 14 August, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed.

SM 79s attacked shipping off [[Bulhar]], three SM 81s and three Ca 133s bombed a fort near the Godojere Pass and retreating troops on the road to Berbera nearby. Three CR 32s attacked road transport at Laferug, Mandera and tracks to Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nAt Tug Argan counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left, either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port.

Six Blenheim I bombers flew from Iraq to reinforce the RAF at Aden and on passing [[Kamaran|Kamaran Island]] an SM 81 flew underneath the formation. The Blenheims dived on the bomber and three achieved firing positions, shooting it down. On landing the crews handed over their aircraft and returned to Iraq in Bombay transports the next day.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}} After a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}} The British withdrawal to Berbera was complete and the evacuation had begun.

The Italian invasion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n{{see also|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian East Africa}}\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the foundation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), formed from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland]], and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], conquered in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain. The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine and feared a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall the British, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter a British intervention. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar, by defeating the garrison and occupying British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the Assa Hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary.

The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}}\n\nWithdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on.

The third Italian raid, by three SM 79s met two [[Martin Maryland]]s from the Free French flight in 8 Squadron, which were patrolling Berbera and one Maryland pilot claimed a SM 79 shot down; it was not confirmed but crashed in flames soon after.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}{{efn|The SM 79 crashed in flames; not carrying wireless, the crew misunderstood hand signals from the other crews who could see smoke coming out of the aircraft. The SM 79 crew waved back but then the aircraft exploded and hit the ground near [[Sheikh, Somaliland|Sheikh]], south of Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}}} The CTSAO at Dire Dawa was reinforced by two SM 79s of 44\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} and three CR 32s from 411\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} at Addis Ababa and three SM 81s from Shashamanna.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}\n\nThe retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}} Five Blenheims bombed the captured landing ground at Hargeisa and five Ca 133s with two CR 32 fighter escorts bombed the British residency at Sheikh. A 39 Squadron Blenheim on a reconnaissance sortie, was hit by ground fire and came down in the sea, the crew being rescued by the cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}}. As the Italian invasion neared completion, three SM 81s of the 4\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} went back to Shashamanna , two of the SM 79s of 44\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} went back to Addis Ababa and three more SM 79s of 10\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} 28\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} arrived from Gura in Eritrea after the 10\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} had exchanged it SM 81s from reinforcements of SM 79s being flown from Libya. In Aden 39 Sauadron gave up two Blenheims to 11 Squadron so that each had five operational bombers.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials; on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} At 05:35 on 18 August three 11 Squadron Blenheims bombed Italian vehicles near Laferug and were intercepted by two CR 32s of 410\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}}, which shot down a Blenheim in flames. the crew parachuted but two of the men died in hospital of burns. Soon after the Blenheims took off, five Wellesleys from 223 Squadron flew from Perim Island and bombed Addis Ababa airfield in bad weather. A CR 42 managed to damage four of the Wellesleys whose crews claimed two hangars destroyed, two damaged, four SM 79s destroyed, two damaged and Aosta's runabout destroyed. Italian records show a SM 79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75|S 75]] and three Ca 133s destroyed, one SM 79 and a SM 81 damaged. Two attacks on Berbera were made by SM 79s during the morning and three SM 79s escorted by two CR 42s attacked soon after noon, the fighters driving a Blenheim F away. Italian troops overcame the second British defensive position before Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\nBefore sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped. SCC members who were embarked, became an armoured car unit under the same title.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=87, 263}} There was little Italian interference with the evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi to allow the British to evacuate without too much fighting, in the hope of a peace agreement being mediated through the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=138}} The last CTSAO raid was flown against Berbera by three SM 79s; soon afterwards, British aircraft from Aden attacked Italian troops as they occupied the town that evening. Much of Berbera was on fire and the wreckage of four British aircraft were found on the airfield.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} Mussolini annexed the colony to the AOI, as part of the [[Italian Empire]].{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Impero italiano.svg|thumb|{{centre|''Impero italiano'' (red); the maximum extent of the Italian Empire shown in pink}}]]\nThe Italians had shown the ability to co-ordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; the forces under British command had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their men. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan, [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nFrom 5 to 19 August the RAF at Aden flew 184 sorties and dropped {{cvt|60|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs. From 16 to 19 August, the RAF flew 12 reconnaissance sorties, 19 bomber-reconnaissance sorties, 72 bomber sorties against Italian troops and transport and 36 fighter sorties over Berbera of the total. The British learned that inadequately defended airstrips could quickly be made untenable, leaving bombers flying from Aden unprotected against air attack. Despite the land campaign, a convoy sailed the Red Sea early in August and another convoy began the voyage on 19 August escorted by 14 Squadron Wellesleys as the Blenheim IVFs were busy over Berbera. After the British evacuation, both sides dispersed aircraft sent to reinforce the local units, the CTSAO being disbanded on 26 August.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created. Delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a {{lang|fr|coup de main}} by Italian 300 infantry on the port enabled the British to get away, despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of whom 161 were Italian and 1,868 were in local Eritrean and Somali Ascari units of the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo di Truppe Coloniali}}. Somali irregulars supporting the British suffered about another 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somali irregulars became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfnm|1a1=Maravigna|1y=1949|1p=453|2a1=Rovighi|2y=1988|2p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores gave the same figures for Italian casualties as Maravigna and wrote that the RAF lost seven aircraft and ten were damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance. Repairs began on the port and supplies for the [[1st (African) Division|11th African Division]] were passing through within a week, reducing the road transport distance by {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The British re-captured the whole of [[British Somaliland]] and on 8 April, Chater was appointed Military Governor.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=418}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[East African Campaign (World War II)]]\n* [[Eric Charles Twelves Wilson]], awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for actions at Observation Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Collins|1964}}\n|last=Collins |first=D.
