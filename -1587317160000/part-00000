Selected prisons within the state are equipped with security housing units, reception centers, and/or \"condemned\" units.  These security levels are defined as follows:<ref name=CDCR2007>California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the [[Patricia Hearst]] kidnapping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident [[Diane Whipple]] was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Phillip Garrido]] was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Richard |title=GANGLAND\u2019S FINEST |url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/ganglands-finest/ |website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine: Gun News and Gun Reviews |date=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" An arrest sweep of 29 suspects took place on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

Inmate [[Glen Godwin]] was able to escape the then maximum security prison. He reportedly escaped through a storm drain and into the American River.

It was written by [[Michael Palin]] and [[Terry Jones]] of [[Monty Python]] fame. It was transmitted on [[BBC 2]]. Following an initial pilot episode in January 1976, it ran for two series \u2014 six episodes in September and October 1977 and three episodes in October 1979. Each episode had a different setting and characters, each looking at a different aspect of [[British culture]] and [[parody]]ing pre-[[World War II]] literature aimed at schoolboys. In the title, \"ripping\" is a chiefly British slang colloquialism for \"exciting\" or \"thrilling\", with \"yarn\" used in the sense of a story.\n\n==Pilot episode==\nIn 1975, the [[BBC]] commissioned a pilot episode from Palin and Jones, envisaged to be a light entertainment comedy piece. The result was ''Tomkinson's Schooldays'' (a title loosely inspired by ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'' and suggested by BBC director [[Terry Hughes (director)|Terry Hughes]]).

It was written by [[Michael Palin]] and [[Terry Jones]] of [[Monty Python]] fame. It was transmitted on [[BBC 2]]. Following an initial pilot episode in January 1976, it ran for two series \u2014 six episodes in September and October 1977 and three episodes in October 1979. Each episode had a different setting and characters, each looking at a different aspect of [[British culture]] and [[parody]]ing pre-[[World War II]] literature aimed at schoolboys. In the title, \"ripping\" is a chiefly British slang colloquialism for \"exciting\" or \"thrilling\", with yarn used in the sense of a story.\n\n==Pilot episode==\nIn 1975, the [[BBC]] commissioned a pilot episode from Palin and Jones, envisaged to be a light entertainment comedy piece. The result was ''Tomkinson's Schooldays'' (a title loosely inspired by ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'' and suggested by BBC director [[Terry Hughes (director)|Terry Hughes]]). Palin and Jones both wrote and starred in multiple roles.<ref name = Palin>{{Cite book| last = Palin| first = Michael| authorlink = Michael Palin| author2 = [[Terry Jones]]| title = Ripping Yarns| year = 1980| publisher = [[Eyre Methuen]]| location = London| isbn = 0-413-46250-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/rippingyarns00pali}}</ref> Once the series was picked up, Jones did not appear in any further episodes.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ripping Yarns episodes}}\nThe nine episodes and their original airdates are:\n===First series===\n#\"Tomkinson's Schooldays\" \u2013 pilot \u2013 7 January 1976\n#\"The Testing of Eric Olthwaite\" \u2013 27 September 1977\n#\"Escape from Stalag Luft 112B\" \u2013 4 October 1977\n#\"Murder at Moorstones Manor\" \u2013 11 October 1977\n#\"Across the Andes by Frog\" \u2013 18 October 1977\n#\"The Curse of the Claw\" \u2013 25 October 1977\n===Second series===\n#\"Whinfrey's Last Case\" \u2013 10 October 1979\n#\"Golden Gordon\" \u2013 17 October 1979\n#\"Roger of the Raj\" \u2013 24 October 1979\n\n==Production details==\n''Tomkinson's Schooldays'' was shot on [[videotape]] with filmed exterior scenes.

When two clients encounter each other, a unique TCN is generated, exchanged, and then locally stored in a contact log. Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the seeds from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN derived from any of the seeds. If a TCN can be derived, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into multiple areas: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, the protocol is divided into three distinct areas: the ''TCN identifier,'' the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== TCN identifier ===\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128 bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. TCNs are used to identify people a with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used to compactly report infection to a central reporting server. TCN reports are authenticated to be genuine by a secret held by the client.\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme (RAK-RVK pair). In the reference implementation this pair is created using the [[Ed25519]] signature scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN/blob/main/src/keys.rs|title=TCNCoalition/TCN/src/keys.rs|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|line. 13}} Then, using the RAK an initial ''temporary contact key'' (TCK) is generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, where <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. This TCK is not used to generate any TCNs, but is used in the next TCK generation in the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>. A 128 bit TCN is then generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i>0} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]TCNs are unique to each device encounter, and RAK-RVK pairs are cycled at regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact. When a client wishes to submit a report for the TCN indicies <math>\ns > 0\n</math> to <math>\ne\n</math>, it structures the report as <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{s - 1} || le\\_u16(s) || le\\_u16(e) || memo\n</math>. A signature is then calculated using the RAK, and it is transmitted to the server as <math>\ns\\_report = rak||sig\n</math>.\n\nBecause a TCK can only be used to derive equal or higher indexed TCNs, by submitting <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> no encounters prior to <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math> can be discovered. However all there is no upper limit to encounters calculated using the same RAK-RVK pair, which is why they are cycled often. To prevent clients calculating unused TCNs, <math>\ne\n</math> indicates the last TCN index generated with the given RVK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/blob/develop/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|title=TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|lines. 49-61}} Additionally, since the RVK is used to calculate a TCK, and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is provided, no valid TCNs in the reporting period can be derived from an illegitimate report. The only correct TCN calculable from a mismatched RVK and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math>, the TCN before the start of the reporting period.\n\nOnce a report is received, clients individually recalculate TCKs and TCNs for a given period using the original algorithms:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_s = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s-1})\\\\\ntcn_{s} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s) || tck_{s})\\\\\ntck_{s+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s})\\\\\ntcn_{s+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s+1) || tck_{s+1})\\\\\n...\\\\\ntck_{e} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{e-1})\\\\\ntcn_{e} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(e) || tck_{e})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This is used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient, but has the dual benefit of verifying reports since false reports will never produce matching TCNs.\n\n==== Memo ====\nIn the report structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the specific implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tag\n!Data standard\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x0}}\n|[[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x1}}\n|[[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}\n|Allocated for future official TCN apps or versions\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0xff}}\n|Reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n|}\n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs.

When two clients encounter each other, a unique TCN is generated, exchanged, and then locally stored in a contact log. Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the seeds from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN derived from any of the seeds. If a TCN can be derived, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into multiple areas: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, the protocol is divided into three distinct areas: the ''TCN identifier,'' the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== TCN identifier ===\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128 bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. TCNs are used to identify people a with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used to compactly report infection to a central reporting server. TCN reports are authenticated to be genuine by a secret held by the client.\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme (RAK-RVK pair). In the reference implementation this pair is created using the [[Ed25519]] signature scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN/blob/main/src/keys.rs|title=TCNCoalition/TCN/src/keys.rs|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|line. 13}} Then, using the RAK an initial ''temporary contact key'' (TCK) is generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, where <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. This TCK is not used to generate any TCNs, but is used in the next TCK generation in the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>. A 128 bit TCN is then generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i>0} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]TCNs are unique to each device encounter, and RAK-RVK pairs are cycled at regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact. When a client wishes to submit a report for the TCN indicies <math>\ns > 0\n</math> to <math>\ne\n</math>, it structures the report as <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{s - 1} || le\\_u16(s) || le\\_u16(e) || memo\n</math>. A signature is then calculated using the RAK, and it is transmitted to the server as <math>\ns\\_report = rak||sig\n</math>.\n\nBecause a TCK can only be used to derive equal or higher indexed TCNs, by submitting <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> no encounters prior to <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math> can be discovered. However all there is no upper limit to encounters calculated using the same RAK-RVK pair, which is why they are cycled often. To prevent clients calculating unused TCNs, <math>\ne\n</math> indicates the last TCN index generated with the given RVK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/blob/develop/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|title=TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|lines. 49-61}} Additionally, since the RVK is used to calculate a TCK, and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is provided, no valid TCNs in the reporting period can be derived from an illegitimate report. The only correct TCN calculable from a mismatched RVK and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math>, the TCN before the start of the reporting period.\n\nOnce a report is received, clients individually recalculate TCKs and TCNs for a given period using the original algorithms:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_s = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s-1})\\\\\ntcn_{s} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s) || tck_{s})\\\\\ntck_{s+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s})\\\\\ntcn_{s+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s+1) || tck_{s+1})\\\\\n...\\\\\ntck_{e} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{e-1})\\\\\ntcn_{e} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(e) || tck_{e})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This is used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient, but has the dual benefit of verifying reports as false reports will never produce matching TCNs.\n\n==== Memo ====\nIn the report structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the specific implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tag\n!Data standard\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x0}}\n|[[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x1}}\n|[[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}\n|Allocated for future official TCN apps or versions\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0xff}}\n|Reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n|}\n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs. After sharing a TCN, the central disconnects from the peripheral.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user tests positive for infection, they upload a report to a central server. Devices then, on a regular basis, download reports from the server and check their local contact logs using the verification algorithm. If there is a matching record, the app notifies the user to potential infection.\n\n== TCN Coalition ==\nOn 5 April 2020, the global [[TCN Coalition]] was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://tcn-coalition.org/|title=TCN Coalition \u00b7 A Global Coalition for Privacy-First Digital Contact Tracing Protocols to Fight COVID-19|website=tcn-coalition.org|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> The TCN Coalition also helped establish the [[Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting]] framework, which functions as a bill of rights for users of such apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dcta-datarights.com/|title=Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting \u00b7 Overview|last=Reed <questions@dcta-datarights.org>|first=Harper|website=dcta-datarights.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nThe protocol is currently used by the COVID-19 contact tracing apps [[CoEpi]] and [[CovidWatch]], and was likely a source of inspiration for the similar [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://covid-watch.org/press_releases/google_apple_press_release|title=Covid Watch Celebrates Apple and Google\u2019s COVID-19 Contact Tracing Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.covid-watch.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}{{FOSS}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://tcn-coalition.org/ TCN Coalition]\n* [https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN Specification and reference implementation]\n\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Medical software]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:2020 software]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n", "name_user": "Bravetheif", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTechnical specification", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCN_Protocol"}

{"title_page": "Mainstream Rock (chart)", "text_new": "'''Mainstream Rock''' is a [[music chart]] in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine that ranks the most-played songs on [[mainstream rock]] radio stations in the United States, a category that combines the formats of [[active rock]] and [[heritage rock]]. The chart was launched in March 1981, as '''Rock Albums and Top Tracks''', after which the name changed first to '''Top Rock Tracks''', then to '''Album Rock Tracks''', and finally to its present title in 1996.\n\n==History==\nThe Rock Albums & Top Tracks charts were introduced in the March 21, 1981, issue of ''Billboard''. The 50- and 60-position charts ranked airplay on album rock radio stations in the United States.<ref name=bbrock>{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | title = Album, Rock Charts Celebrate Anniversaries | first = Gary | last = Trust | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = March 23, 2010 | accessdate = June 13, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140826141823/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | archivedate = August 26, 2014 }}</ref> Because [[album-oriented rock]] stations focused on playing tracks from albums rather than specifically released singles, these charts were designed to measure the airplay of any and all tracks from an album. Rock Albums was a survey of the top albums on American rock radio, while Top Tracks listed the top individual songs being played. Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine. Coinciding with an increase in its reporting panel of album rock stations in the United States, the name of the chart was changed again with the issue dated April 12, 1986, to Album Rock Tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 12, 1986 |title=''Billboard'' Announces Expanded Album Rock Chart Panel |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=98 |issue=15 |pages=10, 16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yQEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In November 1991, instead of reporting panels, ''Billboard'' changed its methodology of measuring airplay by using monitored airplay as provided by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] to compile many of its charts. As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. ''Billboard'' decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1992 |title=Album Rock Chart Changes |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.\n\nTo differentiate between classic and alternative album rock radio formats, ''Billboard'' changed the name of the chart to Mainstream Rock Tracks beginning with issue dated April 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 13, 1996 |title=Name Changed on Album Rock Tracks |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Mainstream Rock Tracks chart did not appear in the print edition of ''Billboard'' from its issue dated August 2, 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2, 2003 |first=Keith |last=Girard |title=The Evolution Continues |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=31 |pages=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> being accessible only through the magazine's subscription-based website, Billboard.biz. In late 2013, the chart was reintroduced to its primary website and magazine.\n\nWhen ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' ceased publication in June 2009, ''Billboard'' incorporated its rock charts, Active Rock and Heritage Rock into its own publication.

The chart was launched in March 1981, as '''Rock Albums and Top Tracks''', after which the name changed first to '''Top Rock Tracks''', then to '''Album Rock Tracks''', and finally to its present title in 1996.\n\n==History==\nThe Rock Albums & Top Tracks charts were introduced in the March 21, 1981, issue of ''Billboard''. The 50- and 60-position charts ranked airplay on album rock radio stations in the United States.<ref name=bbrock>{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | title = Album, Rock Charts Celebrate Anniversaries | first = Gary | last = Trust | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = March 23, 2010 | accessdate = June 13, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140826141823/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958877/album-rock-charts-celebrate-anniversaries | archivedate = August 26, 2014 }}</ref> Because [[album-oriented rock]] stations focused on playing tracks from albums rather than specifically released singles, these charts were designed to measure the airplay of any and all tracks from an album. Rock Albums was a survey of the top albums on American rock radio, while Top Tracks listed the top individual songs being played. Mike Harrison of ''Billboard'' explained that when major artists release albums, more than one song from the album can become popular at the same time.<ref name=bbrock /> The first number-one song on the Top Tracks chart was \"[[I Can't Stand It (song)|I Can't Stand It]]\" by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=bbrock />\n\nIn September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was discontinued and Top Tracks was renamed Top Rock Tracks.<ref name=Whitburn>{{cite book | first=Joel | last=Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2002 | title=Rock Tracks | isbn=0-89820-153-5 | page=9}}</ref> It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine. Coinciding with an increase in its reporting panel of album rock stations in the United States, the name of the chart was changed again with the issue dated April 12, 1986, to Album Rock Tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 12, 1986 |title=''Billboard'' Announces Expanded Album Rock Chart Panel |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=98 |issue=15 |pages=10, 16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yQEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In November 1991, instead of reporting panels, ''Billboard'' changed its methodology of measuring airplay by using monitored airplay as provided by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] to compile many of its charts. As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. ''Billboard'' decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart.<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 27, 1992 |title=Album Rock Chart Changes |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.\n\nTo differentiate between classic and alternative album rock radio formats, ''Billboard'' changed the name of the chart to Mainstream Rock Tracks beginning with issue dated April 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 13, 1996 |title=Name Changed on Album Rock Tracks |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Mainstream Rock Tracks chart did not appear in the print edition of ''Billboard'' from its issue dated August 2, 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2, 2003 |first=Keith |last=Girard |title=The Evolution Continues |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=31 |pages=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&lr=&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> being accessible only through the magazine's subscription-based website, Billboard.biz.
