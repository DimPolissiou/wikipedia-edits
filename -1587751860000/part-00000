The film is a fictional account of the building of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]. Novelist [[William Faulkner]] was one of the film's three screenwriters.\n\n''Land of the Pharaohs'' had a cast of thousands &ndash; Warner Bros. press office claimed there were 9,787 extras in one scene<ref name=\"weiler\" /> &ndash; and was one of Hollywood's largest-scale, ancient world epics, made in the same spirit as ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn ancient Egypt, Pharaoh [[Khufu]] ([[Jack Hawkins]]) is obsessed with preparing his tomb for the \"second life\". Dissatisfied with his own architects' offerings, he enlists Vashtar ([[James Robertson Justice]]), an ingenious man whose devices nearly saved his own people from being conquered and enslaved by Khufu. Khufu offers to free Vashtar's people if he will build Khufu a [[Grave robbery|robber-proof tomb]] - although Vashtar will have to die when the pyramid-tomb is completed, to guard its secrets. During the years that the pyramid is being built, Pharaoh demands tribute and labor from all his territories, amassing  a great wealth of gold and treasures that will be interred with him.\n\n[[File:Land Pharaohs.jpeg|left|167px|thumb|Home Video VHS cover]]\n\nPrincess Nellifer ([[Joan Collins]]) comes as the ambassador of the tributary province of [[Cyprus]]. Claiming her province is poor and cannot afford to pay the assigned tribute, she offers herself to Pharaoh instead. She becomes Khufu's second wife.\n\nNellifer questions whether Khufu really had as much gold as he says, so she is shown an enormous hoard of fine gold artifacts and jewels, and more in an inner vault that Khufu is saving for his \"second life.\" She puts on an ornate, jewel encrusted necklace which Khufu angrily demands she remove. After he leaves, she puts it on again, and dares Treneh ([[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Chaplin]]), the captain of the guard, to take it from her, which he does gently. Later, Nellifer starts an affair with Treneh, who has become besotted with her.\n\nOne day on the construction site Vashtar's son, Senta ([[Dewey Martin (actor)|Dewey Martin]]), saves Khufu from being crushed to death by a runaway stone block. In order to get the injured Khufu out of the pyramid to help, Senta reveals that he too knows the tomb's secrets, knowing that he must now share his father's fate. A grateful Pharaoh offers him anything else within his power; Senta chooses Nellifer's slave Kyra to save her from being whipped for her fierce independence.\n\nUsing a [[cobra]] obtained from a snake charmer with the help of Treneh, Nellifer plots to assassinate first Queen Nailla and her son Zanin, then Khufu, leaving her to rule Egypt. First, Treneh persuades Khufu that there is a rich hoard of treasure in a tomb far to the north, in order to draw him away from the palace. Then Nellifer gives Zanin a flute to practice and teaches him a tune the snake will be attracted to. Queen Nailla sees the snake approaching Zanin and throws herself on it to save her son.\n\nHearing of the queen's death, Khufu sends out investigators to look for snake charmers. Panicking, Nellifer dispatches her servant Mabuna to kill Khufu at the oasis, but Mabuna only manages to wound Khufu before being killed. Suspecting Nellifer, Khufu rushes back to the city. In her chambers he overhears her and Treneh plotting; he kills Treneh in a sword fight, but is himself fatally wounded. The Pharaoh, before dying, sees Nellifer wearing the necklace that he deliberately took from her earlier, and then dies while calling out for his High Priest and lifelong friend Hamar ([[Alexis Minotis]], billed as Alex Minotis).\n\nAfter Khufu's death, Hamar, suspecting what Nellifer did and deeming the tomb truly robber-proof, even for Vashtar and Senta, releases them from their death sentences, allowing them to leave Egypt and return to their homeland with their people as part of a plan to deal with Nellifer.\n\nDuring Pharaoh's funeral, Hamar has Nellifer accompany him into the burial chamber because she \"must give the order\" to seal the [[sarcophagus]].  When her order is obeyed, it releases a large stone in a lower chamber, triggering Vashtar's mechanism to seal the tomb.  Nellifer goes into hysterics when told the tomb is being sealed, realizing she is trapped. \"There's no way out,\" Hamar tells her, adding: \"''This'' is what you lied and schemed and murdered to achieve. This is your kingdom.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dewey Martin-Luisella Boni in Land of the Pharaohs.jpg|thumb|Dewey Martin and Luisella Boni]]\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Pharaoh Khufu]]\n* [[Joan Collins]] as Princess Nellifer\n* [[Dewey Martin (actor)|Dewey Martin]] as Senta\n* [[Alexis Minotis|Alex Minotis]] as Hamar\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Vashtar\n* [[Luisella Boni|Luisa Boni]] as Kyra\n* [[Sydney Earle Chaplin|Sydney Chaplin]] as Treneh\n* [[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]] as Mikka\n* [[Kerima (actress)|Kerima]] as Nailla\n* Piero Giagnoni as Xenon\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Pharaoh costume by Mayo - with handwriting by Hawks.jpg|thumb|Pharaoh costume by Mayo, with Hawks' notations]]\n\nHawks had between 3,000 and 10,000 extras working each day during the fifty-plus day shooting schedule.

This was a source of some controversy as the program occasionally aired around 5pm in some conservative markets (for example in the [[Bible Belt]]). This prompted some viewers to criticize the series as 'satanic' and 'filth'. The controversy was later explored in the Nightmare On Elm Street series direct-to-DVD documentary [[Never Sleep Again]] in 2010.<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/131655-freddys-undead-never-sleep-again-the-elm-street-legacy-2496131677.html|author=Bill Gibson|title=Freddy's Undead: 'Never Sleep Again - The Elm Street Legacy'|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe violent and sexual content of the series often meant that episodes were heavily edited before airing. An example of this is the series finale Safe Sex, which had 8 minutes of its more explicit footage deleted.

This was a source of some controversy as the program occasionally aired around 5pm in some conservative markets (for example in the [[Bible Belt]]). This prompted some viewers to criticize the series as 'satanic' and 'filth'. The controversy was later explored in the Nightmare On Elm Street series direct-to-DVD documentary [[Never Sleep Again]] in 2010.<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/131655-freddys-undead-never-sleep-again-the-elm-street-legacy-2496131677.html|author=Bill Gibson|title=Freddy's Undead: 'Never Sleep Again - The Elm Street Legacy'|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe violent and sexual content of the series often meant that episodes were heavily edited before airing.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" would not air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" would not air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet.

It was the thirteenth round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]], and marked the 87th running of the [[Italian Grand Prix]] and the 82nd time the race was held at Monza.\n\n[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] entered the round with a seven-point lead over [[Lewis Hamilton]] in the World Drivers' Championship, with [[Valtteri Bottas]] forty-one points behind in third. In the World Constructors' Championship, [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] led Ferrari by thirty-nine points with [[Red Bull Racing]] in third. Hamilton started the race from [[pole position]], the sixty-ninth of his career. With this pole position, he broke [[Michael Schumacher]]'s record for the most pole positions in a career.\n\nThe race concluded with Hamilton leading the championship by 3 points ahead of Vettel.\n\nThe race was considered somewhat farcical, due to the number of grid penalties that were taken in the race equalling 150 and making the grid almost unrecognisable from the qualifying results. Only 4 drivers started in their qualifying positions, with only Hamilton of the four not having taken a penalty. Sergio P\u00e9rez, meanwhile, moved up 1 place on the grid despite having a 5-place grid penalty. It is also the first Formula One race to have a Lamborghini Huracan as the medical car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/11023168/vote-how-should-formula-1-change-its-grid-penalty-system|title=How should Formula 1 change its grid penalty system|date=30 September 2017|work=Sky Sports F1|access-date=15 February 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Report ==\n\n=== Practice ===\nMercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas set the fastest times in first<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41122304|title=Italian Grand Prix: Dominant Mercedes top Monza practice|date=1 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> and second<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41126202|title=Italian GP: Valtteri Bottas leads Lewis Hamilton as Mercedes set Monza pace|date=1 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> practice respectively, with times of 1:21.537 and 1:21.406.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/2017/italian-grand-prix/results/practice|title=Practice \u2013 Results \u2013 Italian Grand Prix \u2013 2017 \u2013 Formula 1|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThird practice was disrupted by heavy rain on the circuit, and the green flag was only shown with 16 minutes remaining.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41135087|title=Italian Grand Prix: Felipe Massa fastest in rain-affected final practice|date=2 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> Williams driver Felipe Massa set the quickest time with a 1:40.660.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nThe heavy rains that delayed the start of Free Practice 3 remained over the region, causing qualifying to be interrupted. The session started on time, but was red-flagged when [[Romain Grosjean]] spun into the barriers. After almost two hours of waiting for the track to clear up, the session resumed with Lewis Hamilton taking pole ahead of the two Red Bulls but because of grid penalties it promoted [[Lance Stroll]] to second to become the youngest front row starter in a Formula One race ever.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Esteban Ocon]] got promoted to third ahead of Bottas, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Vettel.\n\n=== Race ===\nThe race was welcomed by clear sky with Hamilton on pole ahead of Stroll and Ocon. Hamilton got away well as Stroll was conservative into turn 1 and was passed by Ocon. Further behind there was contact between Massa and Perez. A few laps later, Verstappen moved to the outside at turn 1 but hit Massa which caused Verstappen to get a right front tyre puncture. The stewards took no further action. There were good battles further behind including R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Ocon and Stroll. During the only round of pit stops (most drivers made only one stop in the race), all these drivers retained their positions. Further behind, Ricciardo was 5th but overtook R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen into turn 1 and closed in on Vettel. In the end, Mercedes finished with a 1\u20132, with Lewis Hamilton winning ahead of the second-placed Valtteri Bottas. Vettel finished third ahead of a charging Ricciardo. On the final lap, Massa attacked Stroll but couldn't overtake him and finished 8th. Verstappen recovered from the early puncture to finish 10th after small incidents with the two Haas drivers ([[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Kevin Magnussen]]).\n\n==Classification==\n===Qualifying===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%\"\n!rowspan=2|{{Tooltip|Pos.|Qualifying

1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2017''')<ref name=\"formal\"/> was a [[Formula One racing|Formula One motor race]] held on 3 September 2017 at the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]] in [[Monza|Monza, Italy]]. It was the thirteenth round of the [[2017 FIA Formula One World Championship]], and marked the 87th running of the [[Italian Grand Prix]] and the 82nd time the race was held at Monza.\n\n[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] entered the round with a seven-point lead over [[Lewis Hamilton]] in the World Drivers' Championship, with [[Valtteri Bottas]] forty-one points behind in third. In the World Constructors' Championship, [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] led Ferrari by thirty-nine points with [[Red Bull Racing]] in third. Hamilton started the race from [[pole position]], the sixty-ninth of his career. With this pole position, he broke [[Michael Schumacher]]'s record for the most pole positions in a career.\n\nThe race concluded with Hamilton leading the championship by 3 points ahead of Vettel.\n\nThe race was considered somewhat farcical, due to the number of grid penalties that were taken in the race equalling 150 and making the grid almost unrecognisable from the qualifying results. Only 4 drivers started in their qualifying positions, with only Hamilton of the four not having taken a penalty. Sergio P\u00e9rez, meanwhile, moved up 1 place on the grid despite having a 5-place grid penalty. It is also the first Formula One race to have a Lamborghini Huracan as the medical car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/11023168/vote-how-should-formula-1-change-its-grid-penalty-system|title=How should Formula 1 change its grid penalty system|date=30 September 2017|work=Sky Sports F1|access-date=15 February 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Report ==\n\n=== Practice ===\nMercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas set the fastest times in first<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41122304|title=Italian Grand Prix: Dominant Mercedes top Monza practice|date=1 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> and second<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41126202|title=Italian GP: Valtteri Bottas leads Lewis Hamilton as Mercedes set Monza pace|date=1 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> practice respectively, with times of 1:21.537 and 1:21.406.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/2017/italian-grand-prix/results/practice|title=Practice \u2013 Results \u2013 Italian Grand Prix \u2013 2017 \u2013 Formula 1|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThird practice was disrupted by heavy rain on the circuit, and the green flag was only shown with 16 minutes remaining.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41135087|title=Italian Grand Prix: Felipe Massa fastest in rain-affected final practice|date=2 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> Williams driver Felipe Massa set the quickest time with a 1:40.660.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nThe heavy rains that delayed the start of Free Practice 3 remained over the region, causing qualifying to be interrupted. The session started on time, but was red-flagged when [[Romain Grosjean]] spun into the barriers. After almost two hours of waiting for the track to clear up, the session resumed with Lewis Hamilton taking pole ahead of the two Red Bulls but because of grid penalties it promoted [[Lance Stroll]] to second to become the youngest front row starter in a Formula One race ever.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Esteban Ocon]] got promoted to third ahead of Bottas, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Vettel.\n\n=== Race ===\nThe race was welcomed by clear sky with Hamilton on pole ahead of Stroll and Ocon. Hamilton got away well as Stroll was conservative into turn 1 and was passed by Ocon. Further behind there was contact between Massa and Perez. A few laps later, Verstappen moved to the outside at turn 1 but hit Massa which caused Verstappen to get a right front tyre puncture. The stewards took no further action. There were good battles further behind including R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Ocon and Stroll. During the only round of pit stops (most drivers made only one stop in the race), all these drivers retained their positions. Further behind, Ricciardo was 5th but overtook R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen into turn 1 and closed in on Vettel. In the end, Mercedes finished with a 1\u20132, with Lewis Hamilton winning ahead of the second-placed Valtteri Bottas. Vettel finished third ahead of a charging Ricciardo. On the final lap, Massa attacked Stroll but couldn't overtake him and finished 8th. Verstappen recovered from the early puncture to finish 10th after small incidents with the two Haas drivers ([[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Kevin Magnussen]]).\n\n==Classification==\n===Qualifying===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%\"\n!rowspan=2|{{Tooltip|Pos.|Qualifying

Featured in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) animated film, the related [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|television series of the same name]]  and the ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'' television series, and they are also featured throughout the comics, novels, and video games of the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe]]. Phase 1 troopers are my favorite.\n\nUnder the command of the [[Jedi Order]], clone troopers fight as the soldiers of the [[Galactic Republic|Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]],You should watch them march! which takes its name from the troopers. At the end of the war, they carry out [[Great Jedi Purge|Order 66]] and executed the Jedi on the accusation of treason against the republic. After the conversion of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, clone troopers became more and more uncommon as they were slowly replaced by the stormtroopers.\n\nDuring development of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially conceived of a planet of clones that caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. The clone trooper armor was designed to suggest an evolution into the stormtroopers of the original trilogy, and it incorporated features from both the armor of stormtroopers and [[Boba Fett]], revealed in ''Attack of the Clones'' to be an unaltered clone of Jango. The armored troopers in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'' are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played Jango. Younger clones were played by Bodie Taylor and [[Daniel Logan]], who played the younger Boba. Unhelmeted clones were played by both Morrison and Taylor, who wore bodysuits to isolate their heads, and some clone troopers featured a blend of the actors' features. In the animated ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, adult clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] and child clone troopers are voiced by Logan.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room - clone trooper costumes (4940400469).jpg|thumb|300px|Various uniforms of the clone trooper Phase II armour at Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room.]]\n\n=== Development and design ===\nIn writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Leigh Brackett]]'s first draft of the film initially developed [[Lando Calrissian]] as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and were nearly made extinct by the war,{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}} but this concept was not featured in the final film. [[George Lucas]] later came up with the alternate concept of an army of clone [[shock troops]] from a remote planet used by the Republic in the war that followed. Lucas intended for the prequel trilogy to depict the evolution of the galaxy's fighting forces, and the clone troopers were the step after flawed [[battle droid]]s.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nClone troopers were designed to strongly suggest the army's evolution into the Empire's [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] army. Concept artist Jay Shuster said of the armor design, \"It follows the formula for a lot of the prequel trilogy. Take something pre-conceived in the existing trilogy and de-generate it.\" Design Director [[Doug Chiang]] incorporated both features of the [[Boba Fett]] and stormtrooper armor into the design, acknowledging the \"vague assertion in ''Star Wars'' lore\" that Fett's armor was connected to those of the stormtroopers. Initial concept models implied that the first generation armor was thicker and bulkier than stormtrooper armor, and this characteristic was retained by the art department for ''Revenge of the Sith''. Lucas expressed a desire for individualized trooper armor from the beginning of art development for ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Several variations were largely dictated by environmental needs, but others were influenced of the 2003 ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Clone Wars]]'' [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|animated series]] and the desert stormtroopers of ''A New Hope''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Art of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|last = Rinzler|first = J.W.|publisher = [[LucasBooks]]|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0345431363|location = |page = 198}}</ref> The clone trooper designs \"progressed\" closer toward the stormtrooper designs, and the film included variant designs similar to the sandtrooper, scout trooper, and snowtrooper armor of the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe designs of clone trooper in snow and cold weather gear, seen in season one of ''The Clone Wars'', are heavily inspired by early concept and costume by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], [[Joe Johnston]], and [[John Mollo]] for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/trespass-trivia-gallery?dlid=5665dfef83f0c1339285d949|title = Trespass Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = February 1, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n=== Portrayal ===\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', all clone troopers are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] and are voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played the clone template [[Jango Fett]].<ref name=\"Archived Cody\"/> The child clone troopers were played by [[Daniel Logan]], who also played Jango's clone son [[Boba Fett]], and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor, who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison. Taylor was filmed multiple times and composited to fill out crowded shots set in Tipoca City, and in some cases, such as for distant shots, he was entirely digital.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\"/>\n\nCommander Cody, seen in armor without his helmet in ''Revenge of the Sith'', was played by Morrison. He wore a blue bodysuit and only footage of his head was used for Cody; he held a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] helmet to approximate the digital clone trooper helmet Cody carries.<ref name=\"Archived Cody\" /> Like Morrison, Taylor also played armored and unhelmeted clones in ''Revenge of the Sith'', wearing a blue bodysuit that isolated his head. Some clone troopers were entirely digital and featured a digital blend of Morrison's and Taylor's facial features. The armor was match-animated to the actors' bodies.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in the 2008 animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' and its related [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated television series of the same name]]. Baker attempted to give each clone trooper a unique voice, taking into account personality, age, and position within the unit, sometimes describing the clone in a single adjective and focusing on that descriptor for the voice work. Each clone was voiced individually, with all the clone's lines for the episode recorded at one time before moving to another character, and the dialogue was edited together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/the-clone-wars-season-two-clones|title=The Clone Wars Season 2: Clones|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLogan voiced the young clone troopers in seasons two and three of the 2008 television series. Baker reprises his role in the 2014 ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'' animated series.\n\n==Portrayal in the ''Star Wars'' universe==\n[[File:Clone Trooper (7271127830).jpg|thumb|Commander Cody cosplay. Clone troopers were among the main protagonists in the Clone Wars series.]]\n\n===In the prequel trilogy films===\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] discovers the clone army on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He is told that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the army on the Republic's behalf ten years prior; however, Sifo-Dyas' apparent death shortly before that timeframe leads the Jedi Order to doubt this. The clone troopers are cloned from Jango Fett, a bounty hunter hired by the mysterious Tyranus, later revealed to be [[Sith]] lord Count Dooku. The clone troopers' genetics are altered so that they age at twice the normal rate and are more loyal and easier to command. The clone army is deployed to Geonosis under the command of the Jedi to rescue Obi-Wan, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] from execution by the Separatists.<ref name=\"AotC\"/>\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'']], set three years later, the clone army continues to fight in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the Separatist [[battle droid]] army. However, Chancellor [[Palpatine]], secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious, orders the army to execute Order 66, turning all clones against the Jedi. The clone troopers kill their Jedi commanders, and, together with a newly christened [[Darth Vader]] storm the Jedi Temple, burning it and killing the Jedi inside.<ref name=\"RotS\"/>\n\n=== In ''The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'' television series ===\nIn the animated TV show ''The Clone Wars'', the Clone Troopers become the focus of some of the episodes to depict them to be more than simple soldiers and with individual personalities. In the final season, more of the nature of \"Order 66\" is revealed when a Clone Trooper named Fives discovers that he and his brothers have chips implanted into their brains that would compel them to kill Jedi when \"Order 66\" is uttered. Ultimately, the Jedi remained unaware of this as Fives was executed by a shock trooper clone ordered by [[Palpatine]] to conceal the existence of the contingency order.\n\nThe animated TV show ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' features a group of former Clone troopers that help the crew of the Ghost. It is revealed that in the years after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire gradually phased out the aging Clone Stormtroopers in favor of birth-born recruits.\n\n=== In other media ===\nClone troopers are referenced in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' when [[Kylo Ren]] chides [[General Hux]] for the betrayal of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|FN-2187]] and suggests that [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] should consider a clone army.<ref name=\"TFA\"/><ref name=\"TFA THR\"/>\n\nIn the novels ''Lords of the Sith'' by [[Paul S. Kemp]], and ''Tarkin'' by [[James Luceno]], several clone troopers are still in active service during the early years of the Empire's reign, such as among stormtroopers serving Darth Vader, and even among the Emperor's elite Imperial Guard.\n\nIn the Legends game ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', the surviving clone troopers were fitted with new armour and weapons, and became the Imperial Stormtrooper corps of the Empire. Later, a combination of natural-born humans as well as clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper corps.\n\n== Grand Army of the Republic ==\nThe Grand Army of the Republic was the primary centralized military force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In addition to warships and advanced weaponry, the army consisted of legions of clone troopers\u2014genetically identical soldiers bred to serve the Republic. Although the clone army was originally envisioned by [[Jedi]] Master Sifo-Dyas, who secretly commissioned the Kaminoan cloners to create an army for the Republic, the clones were ultimately repurposed as the secret weapon of the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order.\n\n=== Coruscant Guard ===\nThe Coruscant Guard is a division of clone troopers tasked with [[internal security]] and [[peacekeeping]] operations on Coruscant, protecting \"[[soft target]]\" public spaces and important \"hard target\" buildings, and serving as escorts and guards on diplomatic missions.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/> They first appear in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', where they search for Yoda's body in the Senate building after his duel with Darth Sidious and later help Sidious recover Darth Vader's body on Mustafar.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}} The Coruscant Guard appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, led by Commander Fox.<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/><ref name=\"TCW Film\"/> They hunt Jedi fugitive Ahsoka Tano when she is framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and for murder in season five, and they search for ARC trooper Fives when he is framed for an assassination attempt on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in season six. Members of the Coruscant Guard wear armor with red markings.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}\n\n====Commander Fox====\nCommander Fox, CC-1010, led the Coruscant Guard, an elite clone trooper unit assigned to serve as peace-keepers on the Galactic Republic capital. Following the Battle on Teth, Fox's squad rescued Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Ziro the Hutt. Fox stormed Ziro's Palace, took out his battle droids, and freed Amidala. Ziro was taken to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. When Cad Bane entered the Senate building and held a number of Senators and the Supreme Chancellor hostage, Fox led a company of the Coruscant Guard to cut off his escape. Unfortunately, Bane had rigged the chamber and the hostages with explosives. Seeing this, Fox ordered his men to stand down and allowed the bounty hunter and his team to leave the Senate building\n\nLike every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His unquestionable loyalty meant he would carry out his orders without question, even if it meant killing a Jedi or another \"brother\". His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army. Additional sources state that Fox continued his duty on Coruscant, until an error on his part led Darth Vader to execute him. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-fox |title=Clone Commander Fox |publisher=StarWars.com |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\n====Commander Thire====\nCommander Thire, CC-4477, a Coruscant Guard clone shock trooper who served as a lieutenant in the Coruscant Guard of the Grand Army of the Republic. During the Clone Wars, he accompanied Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order on an diplomatic assignment to meet with King Katuunko of Toydaria. In the course of their mission Yoda inspired his clone troopers to take strength from their individual traits, such as Thire's patience.\n\nFollowing the initiation of Order 66 and the subsequent confrontation between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine in 19 BBY, Thire and his troopers were ordered to hunt the Jedi Master. The failure to locate his body convinced Mas Amedda that Yoda was still alive, leading the Emperor to order Thire to resume the search. However, Yoda succeeded in escaping from Coruscant with the aid of Senator Bail Organa. Thire later accompanied Palpatine to Mustafar to recover the critically wounded Darth Vader.\n\n=== 501st Legion ===\nThe 501st Legion is a division of clone troopers under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]]. It first appears unnamed in ''Revenge of the Sith'' under the leadership of Commander Appo, and they assault the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under Order 66. The 501st Legion also appears extensively throughout ''Star Wars Battlefront'' video game franchise and ''The Clone Wars'' television series, under the leadership of Captain Rex of Torrent Company. In the ''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe, after the conversion of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], the 501st Legion (nicknamed \"Vader's Fist\") is placed under the command of [[General Maximilian Veers]] that serves as [[Darth Vader]]'s personal battalion. Members of the 501st Legion wear armor with blue markings. The unit is named after the [[501st Legion]] costuming group.\n\nDuring ''[[Star Wars Celebration]]'' 2016, Dave Filoni stated that in a planned story arc for ''The Clone Wars'', Ahsoka, who has left the Jedi Order, is given command of part of the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex; those under her command repaint their helmets orange and adorn them with Ahsoka's togruta markings. She leads them at the siege of Mandalore, which takes place at the same time as the beginning of [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-untold-stories-of-ahsoka-tano-broke-our-hearts-and-1783725803|title=The Untold Stories of Ahsoka Tano Broke Our Hearts\u2014And Ahsoka's, Too|last=Whitbrook|first=James|date=July 15, 2016|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Commander Appo ====\nCommander Appo, CC-1119, served in the 501st Legion under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. He first appears in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', in which he and other members of the 501st carry out Order 66 and follow Anakin, now Darth Vader, in attacking the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Appo\" /> He stops Senator [[Bail Organa]] from entering the Temple.<ref name=\"RotS\" /> Appo later appears in season four of ''The Clone Wars'' television series as a sergeant in the 501st serving under clone Captain Rex. His armor bears blue markings. In ''The Clone Wars'' television series, his helmet is adorned with a white arrow in reference to [[Appa (character)|Appa]] of the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' television series, on which ''The Clone Wars'' supervising director [[Dave Filoni]] worked.<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\" />\n\n==== Captain Rex ====\n{{main|Captain Rex}}\nCaptain Rex, CT-7567, leads Torrent Company of the 501st Legion, often under the command of Jedi General [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Jedi Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]].<ref name=\"Rex Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-captain-rex|title=Clone Captain Rex|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2016}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and its related television series, and he is the primary clone trooper character of the series. Rex later appears in the [[Star Wars Rebels|''Rebels'' television series]], set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''. Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunted worm-like joopa with Wolffe and Gregor before they are offered a place in the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==== ARC Trooper Fives ====\nARC trooper Fives, CT-27-5555, serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Echo.<ref name=\"Fives Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-fives|title=ARC Trooper Fives|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Fives and Echo survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Fives and his unit as cadets in training on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Fives and Echo feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Fives and Echo recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Fives and Echo are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. When assigned to the command of Jedi General Pong Krell, Fives finds Krell's disregard for clone trooper lives appalling and openly disagrees with Krell and with Captain Rex, who is insistent on following orders. Fives disobeys a direct order, and though his actions allow a Republic victory, Krell, without process of a [[court-martial]], finds Fives guilty of [[treason]] and sentences him to [[execution by firing squad]]. However, Fives urges his fellow troopers to see this as an injustice, and the firing squad refuses to execute him.\n\nIn season six, Fives discovers the inhibitor chip conspiracy, removing his own in the process, and attempts to warn the Republic that the clone trooper army can be used against the Jedi. However, Palpatine frames Fives for an assassination attempt, initiating a manhunt for Fives. Fives is able to contact Rex and Anakin Skywalker, and he attempts to warn them of the conspiracy and of Palpatine's involvement. He is ultimately killed by Commander Fox of the Coruscant Guard and dies in Rex's arms.\n\nFives' name is derived from his designation number (CT-27-5555), which features fives in sequence.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> He is distinguished by a [[goatee]] and a stylized numeral five tattoo on his right temple. His armor bears blue markings, and a stylized worm creature adorns his helmets; after his promotion to ARC trooper, he also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and kilt-like kama painted with blue stripes. He regards duty and honor above orders and protocol, feeling that there is no honor in following foolish orders and marching to his death. He insists that clone troopers be referred to by name, not number, and that they are soldiers, not units, and should be treated as such. He is a close friend of Rex and, after the apparent death of Echo, considers his best friend to be fellow trooper Tup, who aids Fives against Krell and is one of the first to refuse executing Fives when given the order by Krell. When Tup begins behaving abnormally, a result of an inhibitor chip malfunction, Fives goes to great lengths and disregards order to attempt to save Tup's life and, later, discover the true cause of Tup's death. With his dying words, he describes attempting to expose the conspiracy to have been his duty.\n\n==== ARC Trooper Echo ====\nARC trooper Echo, CT-21-0408,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/clone-cadets-trivia-gallery?dlid=56735fbcb6f86c976505f8b5|title=Clone Cadets Trivia Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> sometimes CT-1409,<ref name=\"Echo Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-echo|title=ARC Trooper Echo|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Fives. He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Echo and Fives survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Echo and his unit as cadets in training on Kamino. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Echo and Fives feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Echo and Fives recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Echo and Fives are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. Echo is apparently killed in an explosion during a rescue operation in the season three episode \"Counter Attack\".\n\nStory reels for a previously-unfinished four episode arc called Bad Batch (Initially part of ''The Clone Wars'' Legacy project, the episodes were later released to Disney+ in their completed state) revealed that Echo survived and was captured by the Separatists. He was modified into a [[cyborg]] able to communicate directly to computers and tasked with decoding the Republic strategy [[algorithm]]. Echo is rescued by Captain Rex, and with his ability to understand Separatist transmissions, he plays a key role in a victory against the Separatists.\n\nEcho's armor bears blue markings, and a blue handprint adorns his chest-plate, created when Rex touched it while covered in eel blood during Echo's first mission. After his promotion to ARC trooper, Echo also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and a kilt-like kama painted in an asymmetrical white and blue design. Later, after his rescue from Separatist capture, he is visibly a cyborg, with various apparatus protruding from his head and a droid plug in place of his right hand; post-rescue, he takes to wearing what appears to be a stripped-down variant on Standard Phase II Armor. Throughout his appearances, he is characterized as one who strictly follows orders, regulations, and protocol. Echo's name is given to him by Domino squad on Kamino as a sarcastic reference to his tendency to immediately repeat orders, even if his squad already heard.<ref name=\"Rookies\" />\n\n==== Trooper Kix ====\nKix, CT-6116, is a medic serving in the 501st Legion. In season six, Kix aids Fives, a fugitive because he discovered the inhibitor chip conspiracy. The short story \"The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku\" reveals that this action prompted Count Dooku to capture Kix, who discovered the conspiracy himself by the time of his capture. With droids failing to secure a confession, Kix was frozen in stasis for delivery to Dooku. The ship crashed into a planet during a randomized hyperspace jump to escape a Republic attack and protect \"Dooku's prize\". Fifty years later, Kix is released from stasis by pirates searching for \"the lost treasure of Count Dooku\". Kix is taken aboard the Corsair's ship and welcomed to their endeavor of raiding forgotten Separatist bases.<ref name=\"Corsair\" />\n\nKix is distinguished by his shaved hair and a phrase translating to \"a good droid is a dead one\" tattooed across his head. His armor bears blue markings, and his Phase II armor bears a red insignia marking him as a medic. He is \"dedicated to preserving the life of his brothers\", and he even tells an injured Captain Rex, \"As the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you, I outrank everyone.\" However, he still has \"no qualms about fighting the enemy\".\n\n==== ARC Trooper Jesse ====\nJesse, CT-5597, is a member in the 501st Legion. In season four, Jesse, like Fives comes to consider General Pong Krell to be ruthless and reckless (mainly over the casualty numbers). He later helps Fives and Hardcase on a rogue mission to destroy a Separatist supply ship, which succeeds at the cost of Hardcase's life.\n\nJesse is distinguished by his shaved hair with the Republic symbol tattooed on most of his head. His armor bears blue markings with the Republic symbol on the center.\n\n==== Trooper Tup ====\nTup, CT-5385, was part of the 501st legion under Captain Rex. He served in the Umbara campaign and was key to the capture of treasonous Jedi General Pong Krell, supporting and siding with his friend Fives even after Fives had been condemned to death by Krell and stunning the Jedi after a fierce battle with mutinous 501st clones led by Rex. In the sixth season, Tup suffered a malfunction in a biotechnical chip implanted in his brain shortly after his creation by the Kaminoans. Intended to ensure that the clones obeyed [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], the chip caused Tup to shoot and kill Jedi General Tiplar despite not having been ordered to. As Tup was being shipped back to Kamino for evaluation, he was kidnapped by the Separatists (who wanted to know why his chip had malfunctioned), only to be recovered shortly afterwards. Tup's actions led to the discovery of the chips by both the Jedi and the clones themselves, but Tup died of medical complications soon afterwards. Though Fives attempted to avenge Tup's death by finding the truth behind the chips, he was killed before he could reveal what he had learned, with Tup's actions and death officially declared to be the result of a locally acquired virus.\n\nTup's armor featured the blue markings common in the 501st, as well as an image of a single blue teardrop underneath the right eye of his helmet; this matched a tattoo on his face.\n\n===Special operations forces ===\nWithin the film series and in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] media, a number of specialized trooper units are seen, including elite Republic [[special forces]] soldiers such as the 'Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos' (ARC troopers), and Null ARCs,<ref>\"Republic Commando: Triple Zero\"</ref> who usually work alone. All clone commandos and ARCs were trained by Mandalorian mercenaries; the elite Clone Troopers are known as Shadow Troopers.\n\nThe style and color of a clone troopers armor often varies depending on their rank, specialization, unit, or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armor with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'' troopers, who appear in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''. SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech breathing apparatuses and long range blaster rifles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hard Contact|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2004|isbn=0-345-47827-4|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Triple Zero|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2006|isbn=0-345-49009-6|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref>\n\n====Clone Force 99====\n{{section-stub|date=February 2020}}\nClone Force 99\u2014informally known as \"The Bad Batch\"\u2014was a clone commando squad consisted of four clone troopers with personality querks that only slightly resemble normal clones\u2014the result of specially designed genetic experimentation.

Corr, CT-5108/8843 later RC-5108/8843, joins the squad upon Fi's injury. Corr is a regular trooper who served as a bomb disposal expert; because of an injury, both arms from the elbows are prosthetic.\n\n==== Captain Gregor ====\nCaptain Gregor, CC-5576-39, is a former [[commando]] suffering [[amnesia]] and living on the distant planet Abafar. He is introduced in the season five episode \"Missing in Action\", where a stranded Republic mission discovers him working as a dishwasher in a diner. It is revealed that he lost his memories and sense of identity after a shuttle crash during a devastating battle. He was rescued by his employer, who keeps Gregor's true identity from him to prevent him from leaving, but Gregor is able to regain his sense of duty and his armor to help the Republic. Gregor holds off Separatist droids to allow the Republic mission to escape, and despite his promise to make his way home, he is seemingly killed in an explosion.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Missing in Action|series=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1=Steward (Director)|last1=Lee|first2=Brent (Writer)|last2=Friedman|date=January 5, 2013|season=5|number=12}}</ref> He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''.

He praised the decision of ''The Force Awakens'' to explicitly move away from clone troopers as bringing \"much-needed moral complexity\" to the film's conflict.<ref name=\"TFA THR\" />May the force be with you and you and you and you\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper (''Star Wars'')]]\n*[[501st Legion]]\n*[[Captain Rex]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Appo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/appo|title = Appo |date = |access-date = January 30, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-general-trivia?dlid=5390fdbf0a172d315d0007c8|title = The General Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = January 22, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|title = Clone Troopers|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063805/http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|archive-date = July 24, 2011}}</ref> \n<ref name=\"Archived Cody\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|title = Cody, Clone Commander|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000947/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bly Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-bly|title = Clone Commander Bly|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Cody Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-cody|title = Clone Commander Cody|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/coruscant-guard|title = Coruscant Guard|date = |access-date = February 10, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gree Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-gree|title = Clone Commander Gree|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA THR\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/one-small-change-force-awakens-850277|title = One Small Change in 'Force Awakens' That Complicates the 'Star Wars' Series (Spoilers)|date = December 20, 2015|access-date = January 17, 2016|website = |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last = McMillan|first = Graeme}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AotC\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2002|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RotS\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2005|title= [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Rookies\">{{Cite episode |title= Rookies|series= Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link= Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1= Justin (Director)|last1= Ridge|first2=Steven (Writer)|last2=Melching|date= October 24, 2008|season= 1|number=5 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TCW Film\">{{cite AV media |people= Filoni, Dave (Director)|year= 2008|title= [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite AV media |people= [[J.

At the end of the war, they carry out [[Great Jedi Purge|Order 66]] and executed the Jedi on the accusation of treason against the republic. After the conversion of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, clone troopers became more and more uncommon as they were slowly replaced by the stormtroopers.\n\nDuring development of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially conceived of a planet of clones that caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. The clone trooper armor was designed to suggest an evolution into the stormtroopers of the original trilogy, and it incorporated features from both the armor of stormtroopers and [[Boba Fett]], revealed in ''Attack of the Clones'' to be an unaltered clone of Jango. The armored troopers in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'' are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played Jango. Younger clones were played by Bodie Taylor and [[Daniel Logan]], who played the younger Boba. Unhelmeted clones were played by both Morrison and Taylor, who wore bodysuits to isolate their heads, and some clone troopers featured a blend of the actors' features. In the animated ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, adult clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] and child clone troopers are voiced by Logan.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room - clone trooper costumes (4940400469).jpg|thumb|300px|Various uniforms of the clone trooper Phase II armour at Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room.]]\n\n=== Development and design ===\nIn writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Leigh Brackett]]'s first draft of the film initially developed [[Lando Calrissian]] as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and were nearly made extinct by the war,{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}} but this concept was not featured in the final film. [[George Lucas]] later came up with the alternate concept of an army of clone [[shock troops]] from a remote planet used by the Republic in the war that followed. Lucas intended for the prequel trilogy to depict the evolution of the galaxy's fighting forces, and the clone troopers were the step after flawed [[battle droid]]s.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nClone troopers were designed to strongly suggest the army's evolution into the Empire's [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] army. Concept artist Jay Shuster said of the armor design, \"It follows the formula for a lot of the prequel trilogy. Take something pre-conceived in the existing trilogy and de-generate it.\" Design Director [[Doug Chiang]] incorporated both features of the [[Boba Fett]] and stormtrooper armor into the design, acknowledging the \"vague assertion in ''Star Wars'' lore\" that Fett's armor was connected to those of the stormtroopers. Initial concept models implied that the first generation armor was thicker and bulkier than stormtrooper armor, and this characteristic was retained by the art department for ''Revenge of the Sith''. Lucas expressed a desire for individualized trooper armor from the beginning of art development for ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Several variations were largely dictated by environmental needs, but others were influenced of the 2003 ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Clone Wars]]'' [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|animated series]] and the desert stormtroopers of ''A New Hope''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Art of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|last = Rinzler|first = J.W.|publisher = [[LucasBooks]]|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0345431363|location = |page = 198}}</ref> The clone trooper designs \"progressed\" closer toward the stormtrooper designs, and the film included variant designs similar to the sandtrooper, scout trooper, and snowtrooper armor of the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe designs of clone trooper in snow and cold weather gear, seen in season one of ''The Clone Wars'', are heavily inspired by early concept and costume by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], [[Joe Johnston]], and [[John Mollo]] for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/trespass-trivia-gallery?dlid=5665dfef83f0c1339285d949|title = Trespass Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = February 1, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n=== Portrayal ===\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', all clone troopers are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] and are voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played the clone template [[Jango Fett]].<ref name=\"Archived Cody\"/> The child clone troopers were played by [[Daniel Logan]], who also played Jango's clone son [[Boba Fett]], and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor, who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison. Taylor was filmed multiple times and composited to fill out crowded shots set in Tipoca City, and in some cases, such as for distant shots, he was entirely digital.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\"/>\n\nCommander Cody, seen in armor without his helmet in ''Revenge of the Sith'', was played by Morrison. He wore a blue bodysuit and only footage of his head was used for Cody; he held a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] helmet to approximate the digital clone trooper helmet Cody carries.<ref name=\"Archived Cody\" /> Like Morrison, Taylor also played armored and unhelmeted clones in ''Revenge of the Sith'', wearing a blue bodysuit that isolated his head. Some clone troopers were entirely digital and featured a digital blend of Morrison's and Taylor's facial features. The armor was match-animated to the actors' bodies.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in the 2008 animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' and its related [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated television series of the same name]]. Baker attempted to give each clone trooper a unique voice, taking into account personality, age, and position within the unit, sometimes describing the clone in a single adjective and focusing on that descriptor for the voice work. Each clone was voiced individually, with all the clone's lines for the episode recorded at one time before moving to another character, and the dialogue was edited together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/the-clone-wars-season-two-clones|title=The Clone Wars Season 2: Clones|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLogan voiced the young clone troopers in seasons two and three of the 2008 television series. Baker reprises his role in the 2014 ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'' animated series.\n\n==Portrayal in the ''Star Wars'' universe==\n[[File:Clone Trooper (7271127830).jpg|thumb|Commander Cody cosplay. Clone troopers were among the main protagonists in the Clone Wars series.]]\n\n===In the prequel trilogy films===\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] discovers the clone army on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He is told that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the army on the Republic's behalf ten years prior; however, Sifo-Dyas' apparent death shortly before that timeframe leads the Jedi Order to doubt this. The clone troopers are cloned from Jango Fett, a bounty hunter hired by the mysterious Tyranus, later revealed to be [[Sith]] lord Count Dooku. The clone troopers' genetics are altered so that they age at twice the normal rate and are more loyal and easier to command. The clone army is deployed to Geonosis under the command of the Jedi to rescue Obi-Wan, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] from execution by the Separatists.<ref name=\"AotC\"/>\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'']], set three years later, the clone army continues to fight in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the Separatist [[battle droid]] army. However, Chancellor [[Palpatine]], secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious, orders the army to execute Order 66, turning all clones against the Jedi. The clone troopers kill their Jedi commanders, and, together with a newly christened [[Darth Vader]] storm the Jedi Temple, burning it and killing the Jedi inside.<ref name=\"RotS\"/>\n\n=== In ''The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'' television series ===\nIn the animated TV show ''The Clone Wars'', the Clone Troopers become the focus of some of the episodes to depict them to be more than simple soldiers and with individual personalities. In the final season, more of the nature of \"Order 66\" is revealed when a Clone Trooper named Fives discovers that he and his brothers have chips implanted into their brains that would compel them to kill Jedi when \"Order 66\" is uttered. Ultimately, the Jedi remained unaware of this as Fives was executed by a shock trooper clone ordered by [[Palpatine]] to conceal the existence of the contingency order.\n\nThe animated TV show ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' features a group of former Clone troopers that help the crew of the Ghost. It is revealed that in the years after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire gradually phased out the aging Clone Stormtroopers in favor of birth-born recruits.\n\n=== In other media ===\nClone troopers are referenced in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' when [[Kylo Ren]] chides [[General Hux]] for the betrayal of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|FN-2187]] and suggests that [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] should consider a clone army.<ref name=\"TFA\"/><ref name=\"TFA THR\"/>\n\nIn the novels ''Lords of the Sith'' by [[Paul S. Kemp]], and ''Tarkin'' by [[James Luceno]], several clone troopers are still in active service during the early years of the Empire's reign, such as among stormtroopers serving Darth Vader, and even among the Emperor's elite Imperial Guard.\n\nIn the Legends game ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', the surviving clone troopers were fitted with new armour and weapons, and became the Imperial Stormtrooper corps of the Empire. Later, a combination of natural-born humans as well as clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper corps.\n\n== Grand Army of the Republic ==\nThe Grand Army of the Republic was the primary centralized military force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In addition to warships and advanced weaponry, the army consisted of legions of clone troopers\u2014genetically identical soldiers bred to serve the Republic. Although the clone army was originally envisioned by [[Jedi]] Master Sifo-Dyas, who secretly commissioned the Kaminoan cloners to create an army for the Republic, the clones were ultimately repurposed as the secret weapon of the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order.\n\n=== Coruscant Guard ===\nThe Coruscant Guard is a division of clone troopers tasked with [[internal security]] and [[peacekeeping]] operations on Coruscant, protecting \"[[soft target]]\" public spaces and important \"hard target\" buildings, and serving as escorts and guards on diplomatic missions.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/> They first appear in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', where they search for Yoda's body in the Senate building after his duel with Darth Sidious and later help Sidious recover Darth Vader's body on Mustafar.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}} The Coruscant Guard appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, led by Commander Fox.<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/><ref name=\"TCW Film\"/> They hunt Jedi fugitive Ahsoka Tano when she is framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and for murder in season five, and they search for ARC trooper Fives when he is framed for an assassination attempt on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in season six.

Following the Battle on Teth, Fox's squad rescued Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Ziro the Hutt. Fox stormed Ziro's Palace, took out his battle droids, and freed Amidala. Ziro was taken to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. When Cad Bane entered the Senate building and held a number of Senators and the Supreme Chancellor hostage, Fox led a company of the Coruscant Guard to cut off his escape. Unfortunately, Bane had rigged the chamber and the hostages with explosives. Seeing this, Fox ordered his men to stand down and allowed the bounty hunter and his team to leave the Senate building\n\nLike every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His unquestionable loyalty meant he would carry out his orders without question, even if it meant killing a Jedi or another \"brother\". His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army. Additional sources state that Fox continued his duty on Coruscant, until an error on his part led Darth Vader to execute him. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-fox |title=Clone Commander Fox |publisher=StarWars.com |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\n====Commander Thire====\nCommander Thire, CC-4477, a Coruscant Guard clone shock trooper who served as a lieutenant in the Coruscant Guard of the Grand Army of the Republic. During the Clone Wars, he accompanied Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order on an diplomatic assignment to meet with King Katuunko of Toydaria. In the course of their mission Yoda inspired his clone troopers to take strength from their individual traits, such as Thire's patience.\n\nFollowing the initiation of Order 66 and the subsequent confrontation between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine in 19 BBY, Thire and his troopers were ordered to hunt the Jedi Master. The failure to locate his body convinced Mas Amedda that Yoda was still alive, leading the Emperor to order Thire to resume the search. However, Yoda succeeded in escaping from Coruscant with the aid of Senator Bail Organa. Thire later accompanied Palpatine to Mustafar to recover the critically wounded Darth Vader.\n\n=== 501st Legion ===\nThe 501st Legion is a division of clone troopers under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]]. It first appears unnamed in ''Revenge of the Sith'' under the leadership of Commander Appo, and they assault the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under Order 66. The 501st Legion also appears extensively throughout ''Star Wars Battlefront'' video game franchise and ''The Clone Wars'' television series, under the leadership of Captain Rex of Torrent Company. In the ''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe, after the conversion of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], the 501st Legion (nicknamed \"Vader's Fist\") is placed under the command of [[General Maximilian Veers]] that serves as [[Darth Vader]]'s personal battalion. Members of the 501st Legion wear armor with blue markings. The unit is named after the [[501st Legion]] costuming group.\n\nDuring ''[[Star Wars Celebration]]'' 2016, Dave Filoni stated that in a planned story arc for ''The Clone Wars'', Ahsoka, who has left the Jedi Order, is given command of part of the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex; those under her command repaint their helmets orange and adorn them with Ahsoka's togruta markings. She leads them at the siege of Mandalore, which takes place at the same time as the beginning of [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-untold-stories-of-ahsoka-tano-broke-our-hearts-and-1783725803|title=The Untold Stories of Ahsoka Tano Broke Our Hearts\u2014And Ahsoka's, Too|last=Whitbrook|first=James|date=July 15, 2016|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Commander Appo ====\nCommander Appo, CC-1119, served in the 501st Legion under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker.

Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunted worm-like joopa with Wolffe and Gregor before they are offered a place in the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==== ARC Trooper Fives ====\nARC trooper Fives, CT-27-5555, serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Echo.<ref name=\"Fives Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-fives|title=ARC Trooper Fives|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Fives and Echo survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Fives and his unit as cadets in training on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Fives and Echo feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Fives and Echo recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Fives and Echo are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. When assigned to the command of Jedi General Pong Krell, Fives finds Krell's disregard for clone trooper lives appalling and openly disagrees with Krell and with Captain Rex, who is insistent on following orders. Fives disobeys a direct order, and though his actions allow a Republic victory, Krell, without process of a [[court-martial]], finds Fives guilty of [[treason]] and sentences him to [[execution by firing squad]]. However, Fives urges his fellow troopers to see this as an injustice, and the firing squad refuses to execute him.\n\nIn season six, Fives discovers the inhibitor chip conspiracy, removing his own in the process, and attempts to warn the Republic that the clone trooper army can be used against the Jedi. However, Palpatine frames Fives for an assassination attempt, initiating a manhunt for Fives. Fives is able to contact Rex and Anakin Skywalker, and he attempts to warn them of the conspiracy and of Palpatine's involvement. He is ultimately killed by Commander Fox of the Coruscant Guard and dies in Rex's arms.\n\nFives' name is derived from his designation number (CT-27-5555), which features fives in sequence.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> He is distinguished by a [[goatee]] and a stylized numeral five tattoo on his right temple. His armor bears blue markings, and a stylized worm creature adorns his helmets; after his promotion to ARC trooper, he also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and kilt-like kama painted with blue stripes. He regards duty and honor above orders and protocol, feeling that there is no honor in following foolish orders and marching to his death. He insists that clone troopers be referred to by name, not number, and that they are soldiers, not units, and should be treated as such. He is a close friend of Rex and, after the apparent death of Echo, considers his best friend to be fellow trooper Tup, who aids Fives against Krell and is one of the first to refuse executing Fives when given the order by Krell. When Tup begins behaving abnormally, a result of an inhibitor chip malfunction, Fives goes to great lengths and disregards order to attempt to save Tup's life and, later, discover the true cause of Tup's death. With his dying words, he describes attempting to expose the conspiracy to have been his duty.\n\n==== ARC Trooper Echo ====\nARC trooper Echo, CT-21-0408,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/clone-cadets-trivia-gallery?dlid=56735fbcb6f86c976505f8b5|title=Clone Cadets Trivia Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> sometimes CT-1409,<ref name=\"Echo Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-echo|title=ARC Trooper Echo|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Fives. He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Echo and Fives survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Echo and his unit as cadets in training on Kamino. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Echo and Fives feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Echo and Fives recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Echo and Fives are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. Echo is apparently killed in an explosion during a rescue operation in the season three episode \"Counter Attack\".\n\nStory reels for a previously-unfinished four episode arc called Bad Batch (Initially part of ''The Clone Wars'' Legacy project, the episodes were later released to Disney+ in their completed state) revealed that Echo survived and was captured by the Separatists. He was modified into a [[cyborg]] able to communicate directly to computers and tasked with decoding the Republic strategy [[algorithm]]. Echo is rescued by Captain Rex, and with his ability to understand Separatist transmissions, he plays a key role in a victory against the Separatists.\n\nEcho's armor bears blue markings, and a blue handprint adorns his chest-plate, created when Rex touched it while covered in eel blood during Echo's first mission. After his promotion to ARC trooper, Echo also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and a kilt-like kama painted in an asymmetrical white and blue design. Later, after his rescue from Separatist capture, he is visibly a cyborg, with various apparatus protruding from his head and a droid plug in place of his right hand; post-rescue, he takes to wearing what appears to be a stripped-down variant on Standard Phase II Armor. Throughout his appearances, he is characterized as one who strictly follows orders, regulations, and protocol. Echo's name is given to him by Domino squad on Kamino as a sarcastic reference to his tendency to immediately repeat orders, even if his squad already heard.<ref name=\"Rookies\" />\n\n==== Trooper Kix ====\nKix, CT-6116, is a medic serving in the 501st Legion. In season six, Kix aids Fives, a fugitive because he discovered the inhibitor chip conspiracy. The short story \"The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku\" reveals that this action prompted Count Dooku to capture Kix, who discovered the conspiracy himself by the time of his capture. With droids failing to secure a confession, Kix was frozen in stasis for delivery to Dooku. The ship crashed into a planet during a randomized hyperspace jump to escape a Republic attack and protect \"Dooku's prize\". Fifty years later, Kix is released from stasis by pirates searching for \"the lost treasure of Count Dooku\". Kix is taken aboard the Corsair's ship and welcomed to their endeavor of raiding forgotten Separatist bases.<ref name=\"Corsair\" />\n\nKix is distinguished by his shaved hair and a phrase translating to \"a good droid is a dead one\" tattooed across his head. His armor bears blue markings, and his Phase II armor bears a red insignia marking him as a medic. He is \"dedicated to preserving the life of his brothers\", and he even tells an injured Captain Rex, \"As the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you, I outrank everyone.\" However, he still has \"no qualms about fighting the enemy\".\n\n==== ARC Trooper Jesse ====\nJesse, CT-5597, is a member in the 501st Legion. In season four, Jesse, like Fives comes to consider General Pong Krell to be ruthless and reckless (mainly over the casualty numbers). He later helps Fives and Hardcase on a rogue mission to destroy a Separatist supply ship, which succeeds at the cost of Hardcase's life.\n\nJesse is distinguished by his shaved hair with the Republic symbol tattooed on most of his head. His armor bears blue markings with the Republic symbol on the center.\n\n==== Trooper Tup ====\nTup, CT-5385, was part of the 501st legion under Captain Rex. He served in the Umbara campaign and was key to the capture of treasonous Jedi General Pong Krell, supporting and siding with his friend Fives even after Fives had been condemned to death by Krell and stunning the Jedi after a fierce battle with mutinous 501st clones led by Rex. In the sixth season, Tup suffered a malfunction in a biotechnical chip implanted in his brain shortly after his creation by the Kaminoans. Intended to ensure that the clones obeyed [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], the chip caused Tup to shoot and kill Jedi General Tiplar despite not having been ordered to. As Tup was being shipped back to Kamino for evaluation, he was kidnapped by the Separatists (who wanted to know why his chip had malfunctioned), only to be recovered shortly afterwards. Tup's actions led to the discovery of the chips by both the Jedi and the clones themselves, but Tup died of medical complications soon afterwards. Though Fives attempted to avenge Tup's death by finding the truth behind the chips, he was killed before he could reveal what he had learned, with Tup's actions and death officially declared to be the result of a locally acquired virus.\n\nTup's armor featured the blue markings common in the 501st, as well as an image of a single blue teardrop underneath the right eye of his helmet; this matched a tattoo on his face.\n\n===Special operations forces ===\nWithin the film series and in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] media, a number of specialized trooper units are seen, including elite Republic [[special forces]] soldiers such as the 'Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos' (ARC troopers), and Null ARCs,<ref>\"Republic Commando: Triple Zero\"</ref> who usually work alone. All clone commandos and ARCs were trained by Mandalorian mercenaries; the elite Clone Troopers are known as Shadow Troopers.\n\nThe style and color of a clone troopers armor often varies depending on their rank, specialization, unit, or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armor with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'' troopers, who appear in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''. SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech breathing apparatuses and long range blaster rifles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hard Contact|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2004|isbn=0-345-47827-4|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Triple Zero|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2006|isbn=0-345-49009-6|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref>\n\n====Clone Force 99====\n{{section-stub|date=February 2020}}\nClone Force 99\u2014informally known as \"The Bad Batch\"\u2014was a clone commando squad consisted of four clone troopers with personality querks that only slightly resemble normal clones\u2014the result of specially designed genetic experimentation.

During a mission on [[Kashyyyk]] at the end of the Clone Wars, depicted at the end of ''Republic Commando'', Sev's transmission signal is lost, and he is declared [[missing in action]]; his ultimate fate is uncertain. Sev is distinguished by red markings on his armor, and he is voiced by Jonathan David Cook. Fixer, RC-1140 and often referred to as simply 40, is the hacker and technical expert and is characterized as distant and stern; he is distinguished by green markings on his armor, and he is voiced by Andrew Chaikin.\n\n====Omega Squad====\nOmega Squad is a unit of four Republic commandos featured in the ''Republic Commando'' novels.

Fi suffers a brain injury in ''True Colors'' and is declared legally dead when he falls into a coma; medical procedure requires he be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]], but he is taken to [[Mandalore]] where he eventually makes a full recovery. Atin, RC-3222, is the squad's technical expert, and he is described as quiet but deeply stubborn. Atin was trained by Walon Vau, unlike the others, and he initially harbors deep resentments for Vau. Corr, CT-5108/8843 later RC-5108/8843, joins the squad upon Fi's injury. Corr is a regular trooper who served as a bomb disposal expert; because of an injury, both arms from the elbows are prosthetic.\n\n==== Captain Gregor ====\nCaptain Gregor, CC-5576-39, is a former [[commando]] suffering [[amnesia]] and living on the distant planet Abafar. He is introduced in the season five episode \"Missing in Action\", where a stranded Republic mission discovers him working as a dishwasher in a diner. It is revealed that he lost his memories and sense of identity after a shuttle crash during a devastating battle. He was rescued by his employer, who keeps Gregor's true identity from him to prevent him from leaving, but Gregor is able to regain his sense of duty and his armor to help the Republic. Gregor holds off Separatist droids to allow the Republic mission to escape, and despite his promise to make his way home, he is seemingly killed in an explosion.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Missing in Action|series=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1=Steward (Director)|last1=Lee|first2=Brent (Writer)|last2=Friedman|date=January 5, 2013|season=5|number=12}}</ref> He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''.

He is the [[Executive Officer (military)|first officer]] aboard Plo's flagship ''Triumphant'' when it is destroyed by [[General Grievous]] and is one of three clones to survive.<ref name=\"Wolffe Databank\" /> Afterward, he appears with a redesigned character model, including a cybernetic eye implant, and leads a tight-knit unit nicknamed Wolfpack on the battlefield. He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''. Wolffe is revealed to have removed his inhibitor chip, preventing him from carrying out Order 66. Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunts worm-like joopa with Rex and Gregor. When they are sought by the rebel protagonists, Wolffe is suspicious of their motives and contacts the Empire to protect himself, Rex, and Gregor. Rex convinces him that the rebels can be trusted, and Wolffe regrets his actions.  He then thwarts an incoming attack from the Empire to save the rebels, and later on helps them free their planet from Imperial occupation once and for all.\n\nWolffe is distinguished by a scar running through his eye and a silver cybernetic eye implant. His armor is adorned with a gray stylized likeness of a wolf, and he wears a kilt-like kama. He is characterized as detail-oriented and as having \"a sense of strategy superior to that of most clone officers, making him a highly effective complement to Plo.\"<ref name=\"Wolffe Databank\" /> He is impatient with missions that send him away from the battlefield and becomes quickly exasperated with garrulous protocol droid [[C-3PO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-wolffe-biography-gallery?dlid=561f0d21d35e5d7cff132789|title=Clone Commander Wolffe Biography Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nGraeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the decision to make an army of clones is a \"softening of the ''Star Wars''{{'}} own mythology\", though the article later corrected that not all troopers in the franchise were clones. Noting that the films never specify that the clone troopers are replaced by regular soldiers by the original trilogy, he believed that the idea of soldiers who are created solely for war and are little more than machines \"sanitizes the war of the franchise's title\". He praised the decision of ''The Force Awakens'' to explicitly move away from clone troopers as bringing \"much-needed moral complexity\" to the film's conflict.<ref name=\"TFA THR\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper (''Star Wars'')]]\n*[[501st Legion]]\n*[[Captain Rex]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Appo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/appo|title = Appo |date = |access-date = January 30, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-general-trivia?dlid=5390fdbf0a172d315d0007c8|title = The General Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = January 22, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|title = Clone Troopers|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063805/http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|archive-date = July 24, 2011}}</ref> \n<ref name=\"Archived Cody\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|title = Cody, Clone Commander|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000947/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bly Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-bly|title = Clone Commander Bly|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Cody Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-cody|title = Clone Commander Cody|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/coruscant-guard|title = Coruscant Guard|date = |access-date = February 10, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gree Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-gree|title = Clone Commander Gree|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA THR\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/one-small-change-force-awakens-850277|title = One Small Change in 'Force Awakens' That Complicates the 'Star Wars' Series (Spoilers)|date = December 20, 2015|access-date = January 17, 2016|website = |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last = McMillan|first = Graeme}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AotC\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2002|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RotS\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2005|title= [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Rookies\">{{Cite episode |title= Rookies|series= Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link= Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1= Justin (Director)|last1= Ridge|first2=Steven (Writer)|last2=Melching|date= October 24, 2008|season= 1|number=5 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TCW Film\">{{cite AV media |people= Filoni, Dave (Director)|year= 2008|title= [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite AV media |people= [[J.
