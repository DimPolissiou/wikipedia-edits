Differential access to mates has been observed in males; certain males tend to dominate the edges where females first arrive, while others are relegated to inferior positions toward the center of the lek.<ref name=\":0\" /> The male closest to a newly arrived female approaches her and displays wing-scissoring behavior.

These chases are usually brief and successful, with the original male being able to retain control of the female.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn leks, females tend to associate with larger male aggregations.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Isvaran|first=Kavita|last2=Ponkshe|first2=Aditya|date=2013-08-01|title=How general is a female mating preference for clustered males in lekking species?

Blakiston's Son & Company|language=en}}</ref> Woody tissue and other woody material has been found in the digestive tracts of these flies, particularly from fungal [[Mycelium|mycelia]]''.'' Larvae have been reared in a medium of bran-[[agar]] infected with molds, and these larvae fed well in this experiment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Most of the fungal material consumed by these flies develops on wood.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Mating ==\nImmediately before copulation begins, the male fly moves underneath the female's abdomen in order to initiate copulation thrusts. The male then mounts the female, forcing her wings apart.<ref name=\":0\" /> Copulation lasts between 17\u201322 minutes and terminates when the female removes the male from her body.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''H. mycetophaga'' eggs are easily noticeable and are held up by four long filaments that emerge from the substrate.<ref name=\":0\" /> Courtships were rarely observed in younger virgin flies (1\u20133 days old); 6\u20139 days of age seemed to be the primary age at which females became sexually receptive to male advances.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Courtship behaviors ===\n\n==== Overlapping behaviors between sexes ====\nCourtship behaviors observed in both female and male ''H. mycetophaga'' are similar to those found in other flies of the same genus.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prominent wing displays are the primary similarity between the two. Both sexes move their abdomen up and down during courtship rituals, and have been observed to touch tarsi with each other. They will also sometimes attempt to use their middle and fore legs to trample the fly that they are oriented towards.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, both males and females extend one wing 90 degrees in displays.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of female wing display in this species is noteworthy; previously, this had only been noted in the \"lesbian\" mutant phenotype of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Males and females both also showed waxing behavior, which entails the rapid raising and lowering of wings alternately.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Differing behaviors between sexes ====\nMales may demonstrate additional courtship behavior in the form of wing vibration and scissoring. Vibration is when the male holds his wings apart 45 degrees from one another.<ref name=\":0\" /> This behavior was found during the male's approach of the female, as well as during the chasing stage. Scissoring is when the male holds his wings 90 degrees apart to form a seamless line across the body.<ref name=\":0\" /> This typically lasts longer than vibration. Scissoring was more often present during circling of the female as opposed to approaching.<ref name=\":0\" /> Several long bouts of scissoring are displayed to initiate copulation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Mating sounds ===\nSounds accompanied the vibration and scissoring, but not wing extension. Vibration in ''H. mycetophaga'' appears as a pulse song with an inter-pulse ratio (the amount of time elapsed between pulses) of 46 ms.<ref name=\":0\" /> Scissoring appears as a [[sine]] song.<ref name=\":0\" /> A male tunes his aristae\u2014the large bristle attached to the front part of the antennae\u2014more closely with the intra-pulse frequencies of the pulse song, as opposed to the sine song.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yi-Feng|last2=Wen|first2=Shuo-Yang|last3=Ritchie|first3=Michael G.|date=2012-01-01|title=Copulatory song in three species of the ''Drosophila montium'' subgroup extends copulation and shows unusual genetic control|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=83|issue=1|pages=233\u2013238|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.10.032|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> The typical frequency of this call is 180&nbsp;Hz, but this slows to 82&nbsp;Hz as the male's wings close in preparation for copulation.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sine song has been shown to increase a female's sexual activity as well as receptivity, and decreases the likelihood that she will attempt to resist the mating.<ref name=\":4\" /> Moreover, the sine song was used with females that moved around less frequently, while the pulse song was employed while following or approaching females that were more active.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Differences in mating sounds among species ====\nThere are other fly species that have evolved to display similar songs during different combinations of these behaviors. There are also certain similarities. ''D. nitidithorax'' has a vibration pulse song.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZgweCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT545|title=Comparative Psychology: A Handbook|last=Greenberg|first=Gary|last2=Haraway|first2=Maury M.|date=1998-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136794506|language=en}}</ref> In ''D. enigma'' and ''D. lativittata'', the wing extend is also silent.<ref name=\":5\" /> Meanwhile, in ''D. novamaculosa,'' there is a bobbing pulse song and all wing movements are silent.<ref name=\":5\" /> There are differences across species in the number of pulses present within one given round of a song, and the length of the inter-pulse interval also varies.<ref name=\":5\" /> A key distinction between ''H. mycetophaga'' and some other fly species is that singing in ''H. mycetophaga'' occurs with both wings.<ref name=\":5\" /> Use of only one wing, or even abdominal vibrations, is more commonly found.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Lek behavior ===\nMating success for males increases with the size of the lek along with the probability of female encounter. This relationship is linear; as size of lek increases, mating success increases proportionally.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Aspi|first=Jouni|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Ary A.|date=1998-03-01|title=Female encounter rates and fighting costs of males are associated with lek size in ''Drosophila mycetophaga''|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=163\u2013169|doi=10.1007/s002650050427|issn=1432-0762}}</ref> However, mating success plateaus after more than 20 males gather in one lek.<ref name=\":6\" /> The causal relationship between increased female encounter rate and increased mating success has not yet been established.  The [[ideal free distribution]] has been tested with leks, and rejected as each male does ''not'' have an equal opportunity to mate.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females prefer males in aggregations, as opposed to solitary males, and also do not choose equally within an aggregation.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females are more likely to mate if the lek contains over five individuals; therefore, the optimal size for a lek is in between five and 20 males.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nLeks may have evolved away from the source of food because sexual displays would not be easily visible in the poorly-lit forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fact that flies tend to aggregate only on fungi with lighter backgrounds, increasing the visibility of displays, is further evidence for this theory; visibility also accounts for the wing display behavior observed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Visual stimulation seems to dominate leks, though olfactory stimulation through [[pheromone]]s may be involved as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''H. mycetophaga'' is one of few species of ''[[Hirtodrosophila]]'' that exhibits lek mating.<ref name=\":6\" /> There is a Hawaiian lekking species that is closely related, belonging to the subgenus ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of lekking in these related species may have resulted from [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' however, leks occur on the smooth surface of a fern leaf instead of the underside of a bracket fungus.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Female-initiated vs. male-initiated models ====\nFemale-initiated models of lekking suggest that male aggregations are primarily shaped by [[Mate choice|female mate choice]]. On the other hand, male-initiated models suggest that female choice does not actively influence male dispersion or settlement patterns.<ref name=\":6\" /> If the female-dominant model is supported, number of females (along with average male mating success) should increase with the size of the male aggregation. Meanwhile, if the male-initiated model is supported, then the distribution of males should be proportional to the number of females present.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, male-initiated leks fall in line with the ideal free distribution model and the theory has therefore been rejected. Consequently, leks are more likely female-initiated.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Hotspot model ====\nThe hotspot model is one of many that have been proposed to explain lek mating. This male-initiated model suggests that male aggregations are concentrated based on areas of high female presence.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, this model may not fully account for the behavior seen in ''H. mycetophaga''.<ref name=\":6\" /> Previous observations have shown that the presence of [[exudate]]s (fluid emerging from the inside of an organism through some sort of opening), which would attract females, does not influence where displays occur.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Therefore, this model cannot fully account for lek mating in the species. It is possible that the distribution of certain resources may influence initial clumping.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Costs of displaying in groups ====\nThough large aggregations of males are generally more successful, there may be costs of joining that would prevent males from joining. As group size increases, there may be increasingly antagonistic interactions between males.<ref name=\":6\" /> Those males that are not dominant within the group may suffer more from these conflicts, outweighing the benefits of joining the lek. These males may be forced off of display sites.<ref name=\":6\" /> Even though these males are not necessarily significantly smaller than the others, there may be other factors that make them subordinate compared to other males and unable to defend their territory such as age or previous conflict history.<ref name=\":6\" /> The interference model may more accurately explain behavior in this species, as evidence of aggressive encounters within the lek has been found.<ref name=\":6\" /> Poor males are forced onto smaller leks. The most competitive males are found at the best sites on the lek. These males are attractive to females because they provide genetic benefits which will be passed on to the offspring.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Controversy in mating hypotheses ==\nLeks have previously been used to explain how species avoid predation risks associated with displaying at these aggregation sites. However, the idea that lek mating is present in ''H. mycetophaga'' has been contested.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UoABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Leks|last=H\u00f6glund|first=Jacob|last2=Alatalo|first2=Rauno V.|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400864157|language=en}}</ref> One study suggests instead that the flies simply use the bracket fungi as a breeding and food source.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe authors of this paper confirm that collections of flies are present in male aggregations on the white areas of bracket fungi. However, females tend to aggregate around exudates (resulting from the [[Tineidae|tineid moth]] larvae's damage). In fact, females were rarely found on fungi without exudate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=A. A.|last2=Blows|first2=M.

Therefore, male competition plays a larger part in male distribution than female choice does.<ref name=\":8\" /> According to this hypothesis, larger fungi would be preferred as they provide larger display areas and more exudate for feeding and breeding.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe authors suggest that this challenges the idea of a lek by definition. Males are aggregating around resources, which goes against the definition of lekking, in which males gather in an area with little to no resources to breed and no feeding or egg-laying goes on there.<ref name=\":8\" /> The authors contest that leks should not be used for feeding or breeding, and provide females with no resources apart from the male. Males should not compete for resources that females seek, and arriving females should choose among males based on courtship alone.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Social behavior ==\n''H. mycetophaga'' are considered non-social insects, excepting the grouping inherent in their lekking behavior.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Prokopy|first=Ronald|date=2001|title=Joining and avoidance behavior in nonsocial insects |url=http://www.programamoscamed.mx/EIS/biblioteca/libros/articulos/Propkopy%20and%20Roitberg_2001_2%20.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=46|pages=645|via=}}</ref> Despite this, groups of two or more adults have been observed to form at different sites.

Differential access to mates has been observed in males; certain males tend to dominate the edges where females first arrive, while others are relegated to inferior positions toward the center of the lek.<ref name=\":0\" /> The male closest to a newly arrived female approaches her and displays wing-scissoring behavior. In the event that other males attempt to copulate with the female, the original male will interrupt courtship to chase the other male away. These chases are usually brief and successful, with the original male being able to retain control of the female.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn leks, females tend to associate with larger male aggregations.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Isvaran|first=Kavita|last2=Ponkshe|first2=Aditya|date=2013-08-01|title=How general is a female mating preference for clustered males in lekking species?

Females do not occupy larger bracket fungi in response to the area itself, but the fact that more males are present on them.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Male defense of resources ===\nIn addition, researchers believe that the presence of optimal breeding sites or specific resources for females does not dictate where aggregations were formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> Aggregations were observed in areas without resources, and fungi with ample resources were not used more often than those without resources.<ref name=\":2\" /> Males were even more evenly distributed than would be expected through a random distribution. This provides evidence that males intentionally stay away from each other, and this dispersion pattern (as well as the female dispersion) provides evidence for the lek mating system.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is unknown if other environmental factors may influence which specific sites ''H. mycetophaga'' utilizes.\n\n== Food resources ==\nMany, but not all, ''H. mycetophaga'' feed on fungi.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/entomologywiths00folsgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/entomologywiths00folsgoog/page/n386 373]|title=Entomology, with Special Reference to Its Ecological Aspects|last=Folsom|first=Justus Watson|date=1922|publisher=P. Blakiston's Son & Company|language=en}}</ref> Woody tissue and other woody material has been found in the digestive tracts of these flies, particularly from fungal [[Mycelium|mycelia]]''.'' Larvae have been reared in a medium of bran-[[agar]] infected with molds, and these larvae fed well in this experiment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Most of the fungal material consumed by these flies develops on wood.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Mating ==\nImmediately before copulation begins, the male fly moves underneath the female's abdomen in order to initiate copulation thrusts. The male then mounts the female, forcing her wings apart.<ref name=\":0\" /> Copulation lasts between 17\u201322 minutes and terminates when the female removes the male from her body.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''H. mycetophaga'' eggs are easily noticeable and are held up by four long filaments that emerge from the substrate.<ref name=\":0\" /> Courtships were rarely observed in younger virgin flies (1\u20133 days old); 6\u20139 days of age seemed to be the primary age at which females became sexually receptive to male advances.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Courtship behaviors ===\n\n==== Overlapping behaviors between sexes ====\nCourtship behaviors observed in both female and male ''H. mycetophaga'' are similar to those found in other flies of the same genus.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prominent wing displays are the primary similarity between the two. Both sexes move their abdomen up and down during courtship rituals, and have been observed to touch tarsi with each other. They will also sometimes attempt to use their middle and fore legs to trample the fly that they are oriented towards.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, both males and females extend one wing 90 degrees in displays.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of female wing display in this species is noteworthy; previously, this had only been noted in the \"lesbian\" mutant phenotype of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Males and females both also showed waxing behavior, which entails the rapid raising and lowering of wings alternately.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Differing behaviors between sexes ====\nMales may demonstrate additional courtship behavior in the form of wing vibration and scissoring. Vibration is when the male holds his wings apart 45 degrees from one another.<ref name=\":0\" /> This behavior was found during the male's approach of the female, as well as during the chasing stage. Scissoring is when the male holds his wings 90 degrees apart to form a seamless line across the body.<ref name=\":0\" /> This typically lasts longer than vibration. Scissoring was more often present during circling of the female as opposed to approaching.<ref name=\":0\" /> Several long bouts of scissoring are displayed to initiate copulation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Mating sounds ===\nSounds accompanied the vibration and scissoring, but not wing extension. Vibration in ''H. mycetophaga'' appears as a pulse song with an inter-pulse ratio (the amount of time elapsed between pulses) of 46 ms.<ref name=\":0\" /> Scissoring appears as a [[sine]] song.<ref name=\":0\" /> A male tunes his aristae\u2014the large bristle attached to the front part of the antennae\u2014more closely with the intra-pulse frequencies of the pulse song, as opposed to the sine song.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yi-Feng|last2=Wen|first2=Shuo-Yang|last3=Ritchie|first3=Michael G.|date=2012-01-01|title=Copulatory song in three species of the ''Drosophila montium'' subgroup extends copulation and shows unusual genetic control|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=83|issue=1|pages=233\u2013238|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.10.032|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> The typical frequency of this call is 180&nbsp;Hz, but this slows to 82&nbsp;Hz as the male's wings close in preparation for copulation.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sine song has been shown to increase a female's sexual activity as well as receptivity, and decreases the likelihood that she will attempt to resist the mating.<ref name=\":4\" /> Moreover, the sine song was used with females that moved around less frequently, while the pulse song was employed while following or approaching females that were more active.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Differences in mating sounds among species ====\nThere are other fly species that have evolved to display similar songs during different combinations of these behaviors. There are also certain similarities. ''D. nitidithorax'' has a vibration pulse song.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZgweCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT545|title=Comparative Psychology: A Handbook|last=Greenberg|first=Gary|last2=Haraway|first2=Maury M.|date=1998-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136794506|language=en}}</ref> In ''D. enigma'' and ''D. lativittata'', the wing extend is also silent.<ref name=\":5\" /> Meanwhile, in ''D. novamaculosa,'' there is a bobbing pulse song and all wing movements are silent.<ref name=\":5\" /> There are differences across species in the number of pulses present within one given round of a song, and the length of the inter-pulse interval also varies.<ref name=\":5\" /> A key distinction between ''H. mycetophaga'' and some other fly species is that singing in ''H. mycetophaga'' occurs with both wings.<ref name=\":5\" /> Use of only one wing, or even abdominal vibrations, is more commonly found.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Lek behavior ===\nMating success for males increases with the size of the lek along with the probability of female encounter. This relationship is linear; as size of lek increases, mating success increases proportionally.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Aspi|first=Jouni|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Ary A.|date=1998-03-01|title=Female encounter rates and fighting costs of males are associated with lek size in ''Drosophila mycetophaga''|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=163\u2013169|doi=10.1007/s002650050427|issn=1432-0762}}</ref> However, mating success plateaus after more than 20 males gather in one lek.<ref name=\":6\" /> The causal relationship between increased female encounter rate and increased mating success has not yet been established.  The [[ideal free distribution]] has been tested with leks, and rejected as each male does ''not'' have an equal opportunity to mate.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females prefer males in aggregations, as opposed to solitary males, and also do not choose equally within an aggregation.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females are more likely to mate if the lek contains over five individuals; therefore, the optimal size for a lek is in between five and 20 males.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nLeks may have evolved away from the source of food because sexual displays would not be easily visible in the poorly-lit forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fact that flies tend to aggregate only on fungi with lighter backgrounds, increasing the visibility of displays, is further evidence for this theory; visibility also accounts for the wing display behavior observed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Visual stimulation seems to dominate leks, though olfactory stimulation through [[pheromone]]s may be involved as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''H. mycetophaga'' is one of few species of ''[[Hirtodrosophila]]'' that exhibits lek mating.<ref name=\":6\" /> There is a Hawaiian lekking species that is closely related, belonging to the subgenus ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of lekking in these related species may have resulted from [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' however, leks occur on the smooth surface of a fern leaf instead of the underside of a bracket fungus.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Female-initiated vs. male-initiated models ====\nFemale-initiated models of lekking suggest that male aggregations are primarily shaped by [[Mate choice|female mate choice]]. On the other hand, male-initiated models suggest that female choice does not actively influence male dispersion or settlement patterns.<ref name=\":6\" /> If the female-dominant model is supported, number of females (along with average male mating success) should increase with the size of the male aggregation. Meanwhile, if the male-initiated model is supported, then the distribution of males should be proportional to the number of females present.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, male-initiated leks fall in line with the ideal free distribution model and the theory has therefore been rejected. Consequently, leks are more likely female-initiated.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Hotspot model ====\nThe hotspot model is one of many that have been proposed to explain lek mating. This male-initiated model suggests that male aggregations are concentrated based on areas of high female presence.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, this model may not fully account for the behavior seen in ''H. mycetophaga''.<ref name=\":6\" /> Previous observations have shown that the presence of [[exudate]]s (fluid emerging from the inside of an organism through some sort of opening), which would attract females, does not influence where displays occur.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Therefore, this model cannot fully account for lek mating in the species. It is possible that the distribution of certain resources may influence initial clumping.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Costs of displaying in groups ====\nThough large aggregations of males are generally more successful, there may be costs of joining that would prevent males from joining. As group size increases, there may be increasingly antagonistic interactions between males.<ref name=\":6\" /> Those males that are not dominant within the group may suffer more from these conflicts, outweighing the benefits of joining the lek. These males may be forced off of display sites.<ref name=\":6\" /> Even though these males are not necessarily significantly smaller than the others, there may be other factors that make them subordinate compared to other males and unable to defend their territory such as age or previous conflict history.<ref name=\":6\" /> The interference model may more accurately explain behavior in this species, as evidence of aggressive encounters within the lek has been found.<ref name=\":6\" /> Poor males are forced onto smaller leks. The most competitive males are found at the best sites on the lek. These males are attractive to females because they provide genetic benefits which will be passed on to the offspring.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Controversy in mating hypotheses ==\nLeks have previously been used to explain how species avoid predation risks associated with displaying at these aggregation sites. However, the idea that lek mating is present in ''H. mycetophaga'' has been contested.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UoABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Leks|last=H\u00f6glund|first=Jacob|last2=Alatalo|first2=Rauno V.|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400864157|language=en}}</ref> One study suggests instead that the flies simply use the bracket fungi as a breeding and food source.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe authors of this paper confirm that collections of flies are present in male aggregations on the white areas of bracket fungi. However, females tend to aggregate around exudates (resulting from the [[Tineidae|tineid moth]] larvae's damage). In fact, females were rarely found on fungi without exudate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=A. A.|last2=Blows|first2=M.

Therefore, male competition plays a larger part in male distribution than female choice does.<ref name=\":8\" /> According to this hypothesis, larger fungi would be preferred as they provide larger display areas and more exudate for feeding and breeding.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe authors suggest that this challenges the idea of a lek by definition. Males are aggregating around resources, which goes against the definition of lekking, in which males gather in an area with little to no resources to breed and no feeding or egg-laying goes on there.<ref name=\":8\" /> The authors contest that leks should not be used for feeding or breeding, and provide females with no resources apart from the male. Males should not compete for resources that females seek, and arriving females should choose among males based on courtship alone.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Social behavior ==\n''H. mycetophaga'' are considered non-social insects, excepting the grouping inherent in their lekking behavior.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Prokopy|first=Ronald|date=2001|title=Joining and avoidance behavior in nonsocial insects |url=http://www.programamoscamed.mx/EIS/biblioteca/libros/articulos/Propkopy%20and%20Roitberg_2001_2%20.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=46|pages=645|via=}}</ref> Despite this, groups of two or more adults have been observed to form at different sites. However, other adults of the same species have been observed to avoid joining such groups.<ref name=\":12\" /> Flies intentionally space themselves as well as their progeny out from other flies.<ref name=\":12\" /> Only about 6% of males were seen outside leks, demonstrating a clear benefit to grouping; grouped males have a greater [[per capita]] probability of encountering receptive females than do isolated males.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> As many as 70 males of ''H. mycetophaga'' have been observed on a single bracket fungus at one time.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== Conservation ==\nThough not necessarily specific to ''H. mycetophaga'', the species has been included in general reports that ''Drosophila'' can be used as a biological indicator of the health of an ecosystem or environment, particularly in recent times of [[climate change]].<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Peter A.|date=1991|title=Biodiversity conservation under global climatic change: the insect ''Drosophila'' as a biological indicator?|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters|volume=1|issue=3|pages=77\u201383|doi=10.2307/2997493|issn=0960-7447|jstor=2997493}}</ref> Studies indicate that extinctions and re-appearances of rare rain forest species, like ''H. mycetophaga'', follow increases under periods of environmental stress.<ref name=\":9\" /> Overall, this can be used to assess the impact on biodiversity.

The Kirstenator is a cult hero in New Zealand, and before he was a star on the rugby pitch, he spent his winters taking part in traditional Kiwi biltong eating contests. On the pitch, Kirsty is famed for his immense power and electric line speed. He has the playmaking brain of William Shakespeare and the power of a domestic water buffalo that hasn't eaten aquatic plants for a year. In the off-season, Kirsty enjoys collecting making biltong, Queen Elizabeth II memorabilia, and hand-building ceramics. Legend has it that Kirsty rode a [[Great white shark]] from Cape of Good Hope all the way to Exmouth beach, before arriving in Exeter, because it was cheaper and more comfortable than flying economy. One fact about The Kirstenator that not many people know is that he breeds kittens; Jannes started breeding cats at the age of 5 and has now owned over 300 cats in his lifetime.

The Kirstenator is a cult hero in New Zealand, and before he was a star on the rugby pitch, he spent his winters taking part in traditional Kiwi biltong eating contests. On the pitch, Kirsty is famed for his immense power and electric line speed. He has the playmaking brain of William Shakespeare and the power of a domestic water buffalo that hasn't eaten aquatic plants for a year. In the off-season, Kirsty enjoys collecting making biltong, Queen Elizabeth II memorabilia, and hand-building ceramics. Legend has it that Kirsty rode a [[Great white shark]] from Cape of Good Hope all the way to Exmouth beach, before arriving in Exeter, because it was cheaper and more comfortable than flying economy. One fact about The Kirstenator that not many people know is that he breeds kittens; Jannes started breeding cats at the age of 5 and has now owned over 300 cats in his lifetime. Kirsty says that kittens are the animal he will not eat because the protein content is not high enough.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2012\u201313===\n\nKirsten was never involved in provincials schools competitions like the annual [[Craven Week]] competition, but he joined the Blue Bulls Academy in [[Pretoria]] after finishing school.

She is best known for her 1966 Grammy award-winning country hit \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Record World and ''Cash Box'' country singles charts, and at No. 2 on ''Billboard''.\n\nSeely has produced numerous country hits, from the 1960s into the mid-1970s, including duets with [[Jack Greene]] like 1969's \"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\". Seely has befriended many singers, musicians and songwriters in the country music field, including [[Jan Howard]] and [[Dottie West]].\n\n==Biography and career==\n[[File:Jeannie Seely.jpg|thumb|upright|Seeley in 2006]]\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nSeely was born in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], in 1940. She was the youngest of four children. Growing up, Seely, along with her siblings and parents, lived in a two-story farmhouse, which still exists today in her hometown of [[Townville, Pennsylvania]]. Her musical influences partially came from her parents, Leo and Irene. Leo played the banjo on the weekends and also called local square dances. Seely's mother Irene sang with her daughter every Saturday morning while they baked bread together. She started listening to the weekly broadcast of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and at age 11 she began singing for a Saturday morning radio show on [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]] radio station [[WMGW]]. By the time she was 16, Seely appeared on television station [[WICU-TV|WICU]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. While in [[high school]], she was an honors student and was also a cheerleader. After she graduated high school in 1958, Seely worked in her hometown's bank. She also did night courses at ''America's Institute of Banking''.\n\nAt age 21, Seely packed up everything she owned and moved to [[California]]. She first started working at a [[Beverly Hills]] bank, but left after a year and worked for half the money as a secretary at Liberty and [[Imperial Records]] in [[Hollywood, California]], where she wrote \"[[Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)]]\", by asking a young [[Randy Newman]] to bang out the chords for her, as she could hear them in her head, but not play the piano well enough yet to play them. [[R&B]] artist [[Irma Thomas]] recorded it for a ''Billboard'' Pop and R&B hit.\n\nSeely also at this time started working for [[Four Star Records]] (a record company [[Patsy Cline]] once recorded for), where she began her career as a [[songwriter]]. Seely also appeared as a regular act on the program ''Hollywood Jamboree'' with [[Glen Campbell]], who was a rising country music star at the time. Finally, Seely got a recording contract of her own from [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]]. Songwriter [[Hank Cochran]] was impressed with Seely's talents and thought she should move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pursue a career in country music, but Seely didn't think she was ready yet. Upon the encouragement of country singer [[Dottie West]] (who also recorded one of her songs), she finally took Cochran's advice in 1965 and moved to Nashville.\n\n===Success of \"Don't Touch Me\"===\nUpon arriving in Nashville, she was hired to fill in for [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] on [[Porter Wagoner]]'s road show and television series. Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \u201c[[Make the World Go Away]]\u201d, \u201c[[She's Got You]]\u201d, \u201c[[I Fall to Pieces]]\u201d, \u201cThe Chair\u201d, and \u201cOcean Front Property\u201d.

Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \u201cLeavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\u201d to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood.

She is best known for her 1966 Grammy award-winning country hit \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Record World and ''Cash Box'' country singles charts, and at No. 2 on ''Billboard''.\n\nSeely has produced numerous country hits, from the 1960s into the mid-1970s, including duets with [[Jack Greene]] like 1969's \"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\". Seely has befriended many singers, musicians and songwriters in the country music field, including [[Jan Howard]] and [[Dottie West]].\n\n==Biography and career==\n[[File:Jeannie Seely.jpg|thumb|upright|Seeley in 2006]]\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nSeely was born in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], in 1940. She was the youngest of four children. Growing up, Seely, along with her siblings and parents, lived in a two-story farmhouse, which still exists today in her hometown of [[Townville, Pennsylvania]]. Her musical influences partially came from her parents, Leo and Irene. Leo played the banjo on the weekends and also called local square dances. Seely's mother Irene sang with her daughter every Saturday morning while they baked bread together. She started listening to the weekly broadcast of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and at age 11 she began singing for a Saturday morning radio show on [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]] radio station [[WMGW]]. By the time she was 16, Seely appeared on television station [[WICU-TV|WICU]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. While in [[high school]], she was an honors student and was also a cheerleader. After she graduated high school in 1958, Seely worked in her hometown's bank. She also did night courses at ''America's Institute of Banking''.\n\nAt age 21, Seely packed up everything she owned and moved to [[California]]. She first started working at a [[Beverly Hills]] bank, but left after a year and worked for half the money as a secretary at Liberty and [[Imperial Records]] in [[Hollywood, California]], where she wrote [[Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)]], by asking a young [[Randy Newman]] to bang out the chords for her, as she could hear them in her head, but not play the piano well enough yet to play them. [[R&B]] artist [[Irma Thomas]] recorded it for a Billboard Pop and R&B hit.\n\nSeely also at this time started working for [[Four Star Records]] (a record company [[Patsy Cline]] once recorded for), where she began her career as a [[songwriter]]. Seely also appeared as a regular act on the program ''Hollywood Jamboree'' with [[Glen Campbell]], who was a rising country music star at the time. Finally, Seely got a recording contract of her own from [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]]. Songwriter [[Hank Cochran]] was impressed with Seely's talents and thought she should move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pursue a career in country music, but Seely didn't think she was ready yet. Upon the encouragement of country singer [[Dottie West]] (who also recorded one of her songs), she finally took Cochran's advice in 1965 and moved to Nashville.\n\n===Success of \"Don't Touch Me\"===\nUpon arriving in Nashville, she was hired to fill in for [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] on [[Porter Wagoner]]'s road show and television series. Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \u201c[[Make the World Go Away]]\u201d, \u201c[[She's Got You]]\u201d, \u201c[[I Fall to Pieces]]\u201d, \u201cThe Chair\u201d, and \u201cOcean Front Property\u201d.

It is widely held to be the highest ranking institution in the country, and it also ranks 18th in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Study in Venezuela|url = http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/south-america/venezuela/guide|website = Top Universities|access-date = 2016-02-09}}</ref> Founded in 1721, it is the oldest university in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\nThe main university campus, [[Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas]], was designed by [[architect]] [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and it is considered a masterpiece of [[urban planning]] and was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2000.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe origin of the university goes back to [[Friar]] Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Acu\u00f1a (1620\u20131682), a Peruvian [[Bishop]] who studied [[theology]] at the [[Universidad de San Marcos]] and founded in 1673 the [[Seminary]] [[Saint Rose of Lima]] in Caracas named after the first [[Catholic]] [[Saint]] born in the [[Americas]]. In the following years, Friar Diego de Ba\u00f1os y Sotomayor broadened the scope of the seminary by creating the School and Seminary of Saint Rose of Lima in 1696. Yet, in spite of the creation of the seminar, students who wished to obtain a university degree had to travel great distances to attend universities located in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Bogot\u00e1]] or [[Mexico City]]. Given such harsh circumstances, the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the Seminary, Francisco Mart\u00ednez de Porras and the people of Caracas requested the royal court in Madrid the creation of a university in Venezuela (then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]). As a result, on 22 December 1721 [[Philip V of Spain]] signed in [[:es:Lerma (Burgos)|Lerma]] a Royal Decree that transformed the School-Seminary into the ''Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas''. The Royal Decree was concurred by [[Pope Innocent XIII]] with a [[Papal bull]] in 1722. The university offered degrees in [[Philosophy]], Theology, [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] and [[Medicine]]. Until 1810, when the Seminary of Saint [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]] located in [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]] became the [[Universidad de Los Andes (Venezuela)|Universidad de Los Andes]], the ''Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas'' was the only university existing in the country.\n\n[[Image:University of Caracas 1911.jpg|thumb|The old campus in 1911. The building also served as the location for the [[National Library of Venezuela|National Library]] when it was founded in 1833. It is currently known as the ''Palacio de las Academias'' which is Spanish for \"Palace of Academies\"]]\n\n===Republican years===\nUntil the end of the 18th century, the official papal and royal censorship on books was largely ignored in Venezuela, a situation which allowed the smuggling of the works by [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius|Helvetius]], [[Grotius]] in the ships belonging to the [[Guipuzcoana Company]].\n\nThe Royal constitution was displaced by the Republican Statutes proclaimed by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] on 24 June 1827. The new statutes gave the institution a secular character and transferred the main authority to the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[Image:Biblioteca Central-UCV.JPG|thumb|Central Library]]\nOn December 1908, [[Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez]] came into power with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the government of [[Cipriano Castro]]. G\u00f3mez stayed in power until his death in 1935, and during this time the [[Dictator]], having ambivalent feelings about the purpose of educating free minds when he could hire foreigners to exercise any technical requirements for the nation, decided to close the university from 1912 to 1922. When it reopened, the Rector Felipe Guevara Rojas had reorganized the traditional division of only a few schools, separating them into departments.\n\n1928 became a very important year for the university when a group of students, known as the [[Generation of 1928]], organized events during the \"Students Week\" protesting the dictatorship which culminated in an attempt to overthrow G\u00f3mez on 7 April of that year. This group, which shared a common front against G\u00f3mez, was conformed by people like [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]], [[Juan Oropeza]], Isaac Pardo and Rodolfo Quintero. Most of them were jailed after the events or went into exile without being able to finish their studies.\n\nThe university continued to be at the forefront of the democratization of the country when in 1936, then President [[Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras]], ordered a decree suspending the Constitutional rights and declaring a general censorship of the press because the oil workers decided to start a strike (an unprecedented deed at the time). The Rector of the University, Francisco Antonio R\u00edsquez, led the protest that followed through the streets of Caracas against the policies of L\u00f3pez Contreras.\n\nBy 1942, the student population had been growing steadily for decades without any significant expansion of the University. Instead several schools, like Medicine, were moved to other buildings around the city. The [[Administration (government)|administration]] of President [[Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita]] felt the need to move the university to a larger and more modern location where it could function as coherent whole. The government bought the Hacienda Ibarra and the responsibility of the main design was given to the architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] after a visit to the [[University City of Bogot\u00e1]] convinced the authorities of the Ministry of Public Works that, in order to avoid constructing a group of heterogeneous buildings, the design should be under one architect.\n\n[[Image:Aula Magna-Calder-UCV.JPG|thumb|left|\"Floating Clouds\" by [[Alexander Calder]] in the [[Aula Magna (Central University of Venezuela)|Aula Magna]]]]\nThe new campus was going to become a vast urban complex of about 200 hectares and included 40 buildings. Villanueva worked with 28 avant-garde artists of the time, from Venezuela and the rest of the world, to build what continues to be one of the most successful applications of [[Modern Architecture]] in Latin America. Villanueva's guiding principle was the creation of a space where art and architecture cohabited in harmony in a \"Synthesis of Arts\". Among some of the most important pieces present in the university are the \"Floating Clouds\" by [[Alexander Calder]], murals by [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and sculptures by [[Jean Arp]] and [[Henri Laurens]]. The ''[[Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas]]'' was declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], and it is the only modern university campus designed by a single architect to receive such high honor.\n\nIn 1958, after the fall of dictator [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]], a government commission established a new law for the universities. The new law came into place on 5 December, guaranteeing that faculty and students could work in an environment of freedom and tolerance. This very important legal foundation was however abused during the 1960s when [[guerrilla]] rebels, supported by [[Fidel Castro]] took refuge inside the university campus to escape prosecution from the government. This tense situation came to a stalemate in 1969 when students asking for a reform took over the university. On 3 October 1970, the administration of President [[Rafael Caldera]] ordered the university to be raided by the military and Rector Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Bianco was forced to resign. The university reopened in 1971 with a new Rector and a new plan for renovation.\n\nIn terms of the academic development of the modern university, the second half of the 20th century was a time when the Central University's faculty body benefited greatly from the influx of European immigrants. Many intellectuals settled in Venezuela after the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]] and found jobs at the university. Those scientists and humanists helped develop lines of research and teaching at the university and educated many of the present generation of faculty members.\n\n==Organization and degrees==\nThe university is organized into 11 schools ([[Faculty (division)|Facultades]]) which are subdivided into 40 departments (Escuelas).\n\nAll schools offer undergraduate degrees at the level of [[Licenciatura]] (5 years) and graduate degrees at the level of [[master's degree]] (2 years) and [[PhD]] (3\u20134 years) from the Graduate School.<ref>[http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/ Bienvenido al SIDEP<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001223403/http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/ |date=1 October 2006 }}</ref> The Graduate School, founded in 1941, offers 222 different specializations, 109 Master's degrees and 40 PhDs.<ref>[http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/acercade/ Bienvenido al SIDEP<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001225633/http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/acercade/ |date=1 October 2006 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Otero-Facultad Arquitectura-UCV.JPG|thumb|School of Architecture.

It is widely held to be the highest ranking institution in the country, and it also ranks 18th in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Study in Venezuela|url = http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/south-america/venezuela/guide|website = Top Universities|access-date = 2016-02-09}}</ref> Founded in 1721, it is the oldest university in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\nThe main university campus, [[Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas]], was designed by [[architect]] [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and it is considered a masterpiece of [[urban planning]] and was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2000.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe origin of the university goes back to [[Friar]] Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Acu\u00f1a (1620\u20131682), a Peruvian [[Bishop]] who studied [[theology]] at the [[Universidad de San Marcos]] and founded in 1673 the [[Seminary]] [[Saint Rose of Lima]] in Caracas named after the first [[Catholic]] [[Saint]] born in the [[Americas]]. In the following years, Friar Diego de Ba\u00f1os y Sotomayor broadened the scope of the seminary by creating the School and Seminary of Saint Rose of Lima in 1696. Yet, in spite of the creation of the seminar, students who wished to obtain a university degree had to travel great distances to attend universities located in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Bogot\u00e1]] or [[Mexico City]]. Given such harsh circumstances, the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the Seminary, Francisco Mart\u00ednez de Porras and the people of Caracas requested the royal court in Madrid the creation of a university in Venezuela (then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]). As a result, on 22 December 1721 [[Philip V of Spain]] signed in [[:es:Lerma (Burgos)|Lerma]] a Royal Decree that transformed the School-Seminary into the ''Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas''. The Royal Decree was concurred by [[Pope Innocent XIII]] with a [[Papal bull]] in 1722. The university offered degrees in [[Philosophy]], Theology, [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] and [[Medicine]]. Until 1810, when the Seminary of Saint [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]] located in [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]] became the [[Universidad de Los Andes (Venezuela)|Universidad de Los Andes]], the ''Universidad Real y Pontificia de Caracas'' was the only university existing in the country.\n\n[[Image:University of Caracas 1911.jpg|thumb|The old campus in 1911. The building also served as the location for the [[National Library of Venezuela|National Library]] when it was founded in 1833. It is currently known as the ''Palacio de las Academias'' which is Spanish for \"Palace of Academies\"]]\n\n===Republican years===\nUntil the end of the 18th century, the official papal and royal censorship on books was largely ignored in Venezuela, a situation which allowed the smuggling of the works by [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius|Helvetius]], [[Grotius]] in the ships belonging to the [[Guipuzcoana Company]].\n\nThe Royal constitution was displaced by the Republican Statutes proclaimed by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] on 24 June 1827. The new statutes gave the institution a secular character and transferred the main authority to the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[Image:Biblioteca Central-UCV.JPG|thumb|Central Library]]\nOn December 1908, [[Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez]] came into power with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the government of [[Cipriano Castro]]. G\u00f3mez stayed in power until his death in 1935, and during this time the [[Dictator]], having ambivalent feelings about the purpose of educating free minds when he could hire foreigners to exercise any technical requirements for the nation, decided to close the university from 1912 to 1922. When it reopened, the Rector Felipe Guevara Rojas had reorganized the traditional division of only a few schools, separating them into departments.\n\n1928 became a very important year for the university when a group of students, known as the [[Generation of 1928]], organized events during the \"Students Week\" protesting the dictatorship which culminated in an attempt to overthrow G\u00f3mez on 7 April of that year. This group, which shared a common front against G\u00f3mez, was conformed by people like [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]], [[Juan Oropeza]], Isaac Pardo and Rodolfo Quintero. Most of them were jailed after the events or went into exile without being able to finish their studies.\n\nThe university continued to be at the forefront of the democratization of the country when in 1936, then President [[Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras]], ordered a decree suspending the Constitutional rights and declaring a general censorship of the press because the oil workers decided to start a strike (an unprecedented deed at the time). The Rector of the University, Francisco Antonio R\u00edsquez, led the protest that followed through the streets of Caracas against the policies of L\u00f3pez Contreras.\n\nBy 1942, the student population had been growing steadily for decades without any significant expansion of the University. Instead several schools, like Medicine, were moved to other buildings around the city. The [[Administration (government)|administration]] of President [[Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita]] felt the need to move the university to a larger and more modern location where it could function as coherent whole. The government bought the Hacienda Ibarra and the responsibility of the main design was given to the architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] after a visit to the [[University City of Bogot\u00e1]] convinced the authorities of the Ministry of Public Works that, in order to avoid constructing a group of heterogeneous buildings, the design should be under one architect.\n\n[[Image:Aula Magna-Calder-UCV.JPG|thumb|left|\"Floating Clouds\" by [[Alexander Calder]] in the [[Aula Magna (Central University of Venezuela)|Aula Magna]]]]\nThe new campus was going to become a vast urban complex of about 200 hectares and included 40 buildings. Villanueva worked with 28 avant-garde artists of the time, from Venezuela and the rest of the world, to build what continues to be one of the most successful applications of [[Modern Architecture]] in Latin America. Villanueva's guiding principle was the creation of a space where art and architecture cohabited in harmony in a \"Synthesis of Arts\". Among some of the most important pieces present in the university are the \"Floating Clouds\" by [[Alexander Calder]], murals by [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and sculptures by [[Jean Arp]] and [[Henri Laurens]]. The ''[[Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas]]'' was declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], and it is the only modern university campus designed by a single architect to receive such high honor.\n\nIn 1958, after the fall of dictator [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]], a government commission established a new law for the universities. The new law came into place on 5 December, guaranteeing that faculty and students could work in an environment of freedom and tolerance. This very important legal foundation was however abused during the 1960s when [[guerrilla]] rebels, supported by [[Fidel Castro]] took refuge inside the university campus to escape prosecution from the government. This tense situation came to a stalemate in 1969 when students asking for a reform took over the university. On 3 October 1970, the administration of President [[Rafael Caldera]] ordered the university to be raided by the military and Rector Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Bianco was forced to resign. The university reopened in 1971 with a new Rector and a new plan for renovation.\n\nIn terms of the academic development of the modern university, the second half of the 20th century was a time when the Central University's faculty body benefited greatly from the influx of European immigrants. Many intellectuals settled in Venezuela after the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[World War II]] and found jobs at the university. Those scientists and humanists helped develop lines of research and teaching at the university and educated many of the present generation of faculty members.\n\n==Organization and degrees==\nThe university is organized into 11 schools ([[Faculty (division)|Facultades]]) which are subdivided into 40 departments (Escuelas).\n\nAll schools offer undergraduate degrees at the level of [[Licenciatura]] (5 years) and graduate degrees at the level of [[master's degree]] (2 years) and [[PhD]] (3\u20134 years) from the Graduate School.<ref>[http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/ Bienvenido al SIDEP<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001223403/http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/ |date=1 October 2006 }}</ref> The Graduate School, founded in 1941, offers 222 different specializations, 109 Master's degrees and 40 PhDs.<ref>[http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/acercade/ Bienvenido al SIDEP<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001225633/http://www.postgrado.ucv.ve/acercade/ |date=1 October 2006 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Otero-Facultad Arquitectura-UCV.JPG|thumb|School of Architecture.

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed:<br>\nAiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]];<br>\nBrita as [[Jennifer Holliday]];<br>\nCrystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]];<br>\nGigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\";<br>\nHeidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]];<br>\nJackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]];<br>\nJan as [[Bernadette Peters]];<br>\nJaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]];<br>\nSherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]];<br>\nWidow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].<br>\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]]. On the main stage, Heidi N Closet, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given glowing critiques over their runways, with Gigi receiving commendations from RuPaul herself for exceeding expectations. Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Crystal Methyd receive negative critiques over their performances, with the latter two receiving positive feedback over their runways.\n\nGigi Goode is declared the winner of the challenge, with Aiden Zhane and Brita in the bottom two. They lip sync to the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway version]] of \"[[Let It Go]]\" (performed by [[Caissie Levy]] as Elsa). Brita wins the lip sync, and Aiden is eliminated from the competition.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Daniel Franzese]] and [[Jonathan Bennett (actor)|Jonathan Bennett]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Main Challenge:''' [[Snatch Game]]\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Frozen Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner: Gigi Goode'''</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Bottom Two''': Aiden Zhane and Brita\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Let It Go]]\" by [[Caissie Levy]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Aiden Zhane</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I hope my screams were loud enough for you Bitches.

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode.

Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed:<br>\nAiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]];<br>\nBrita as [[Jennifer Holliday]];<br>\nCrystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]];<br>\nGigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\";<br>\nHeidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]];<br>\nJackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]];<br>\nJan as [[Bernadette Peters]];<br>\nJaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]];<br>\nSherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]];<br>\nWidow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].<br>\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].

Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/28/why-macos-mojave-requires-metal----and-deprecates-opengl|title=Why macOS Mojave requires Metal \u2014 and deprecates OpenGL|last=Dilger|first=Daniel E.|work=Apple Insider|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nmacOS does not natively support [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]], the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL.

Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/28/why-macos-mojave-requires-metal----and-deprecates-opengl|title=Why macOS Mojave requires Metal \u2014 and deprecates OpenGL|last=Dilger|first=Daniel E.|work=Apple Insider|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nmacOS does not natively support [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]], the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL.

Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child.

All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth.
