It was fundamental to the cotton textile industry prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It laid the foundations for later machinery such as the [[spinning jenny]] and [[spinning frame]], which displaced the spinning wheel during the Industrial Revolution.\n\n==How it works==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nBasic spinning of yarn involves taking a clump of fibres and teasing a bit of them out, then twisting it into a basic string shape. You continue pulling and twisting to make it longer and longer, and to control the thickness. Thousands of years ago, people begin doing this onto a stick, called a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]], which is a very lengthy process. spinning wheels usually throw balls of fire due to the fedora used to make them, this can cause obstruction to life.\n\nThe actual wheel part of a spinning wheel doesn't take place of the spindle, instead it automates the twisting process, allowing you to \"twist\" the thread without having to constantly do so manually, and also the size of the wheel lets you more finely control the amount of twist. The thread still ends up on a spindle, just as it did pre-wheel.\n\nThe wheel itself was originally free-moving, spun by a hand or foot reaching out and turning it directly. Eventually, simple mechanisms were created that let you simply push at a pedal and keep the wheel turning at an even more constant rate. This mechanism has been the main source of technological progress for the spinning wheel, before the 18th century.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Spinning wheel Charkhu in Maymand Museum.jpg|thumb|Spinning wheel Charkhu in [[Meymand, Kerman|Maymand]], Kerman, Iran]]\n[[File:Illustration of al-Hariri Maqamat spinning wheel.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al-Maqamat]], painted by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]] (1237)]]\n[[File:Wang Juzheng's Spinning Wheel, Close Up 2.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Spinning Wheel'', by [[History of Chinese art|Chinese artist]] Wang Juzheng, [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (c. 1270)<ref>Deng, Yingke and Pingxing Wang.

The earliest unambiguous reference to a spinning wheel in India is dated to 1350, suggesting that the spinning wheel was introduced from Iran to India.<ref name=\"Pacey\"/> In France, the spindle and distaff were not displaced until the mid 18th century.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present\n |last=Landes\t\n |first= David.

The first stage in mechanizing the process was mounting the spindle horizontally so it could be rotated by a cord encircling a large, hand-driven wheel. The great wheel is an example of this type, where the fibre is held in the left hand and the wheel slowly turned with the right. Holding the fibre at a slight angle to the spindle produced the necessary twist.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/spinning-wheel |chapter=Spinning wheel |title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title-link=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |volume=11 |edition=15 |year=1998 |page=99 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> The spun yarn was then wound onto the spindle by moving it so as to form a right angle with the spindle. This type of wheel, while known in Europe by the 14th century, was not in general use until later.

In 1533, a citizen of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] is said to have added a [[treadle]], by which the spinner could rotate her spindle with one foot and have both hands free to spin. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew a picture of the flyer, which twists the yarn before winding it onto the spindle. During the 16th century a treadle wheel with flyer was in common use, and gained such names as the Saxony wheel and the [[flax]] wheel. It sped up production, as one needn't stop spinning to wind up the yarn.\n\nAccording to [[Mark Elvin]], 14th-century Chinese technical manuals describe an automatic water-powered spinning wheel. Comparable devices were not developed in Europe until the 18th century. However, it fell into disuse when fibre production shifted from [[hemp]] to [[cotton]]. It was forgotten by the 17th century. The decline of the automatic spinning wheel in China is an important part of Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] theory to explain why there was no indigenous [[industrial Revolution]] in China despite its high levels of wealth and scientific knowledge.\n\n[[File:Mrs. Skindzierz- Jakubowska at the Spinning Wheel 1976.JPG|thumb|left|Elder citizen of [[Suwa\u0142ki]] region, [[Poland]] - Mrs. Skindzierz-Jakubowska (82) at the spinning wheel, 1976<ref>Picture made in the presbitery of [[\u017byliny]] parish near [[Suwa\u0142ki]], [[Poland]], september 1976 (phot.

[[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] first worked on the problem in 1738, patenting the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing [[wool]] to a more even thickness. Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, yarn could be twisted and spun quickly and efficiently. However, they did not have much financial success. In 1771, Richard Arkwright used waterwheels to power looms for the production of cotton cloth, his invention becoming known as the water frame.\n\nMore modern spinning machines use a mechanical means to rotate the spindle, as well as an automatic method to draw out fibres, and devices to work many spindles together at speeds previously unattainable.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Newer technologies that offer even faster yarn production include friction spinning, an open-end system, and air jets.<ref name=Wayne>Cotton: Origin, History, Technology, and Production By C.

Until the acceptance of rotor spinning wheel, all yarns were produced by aligning fibres through drawing techniques and then twisting the fibre together. With rotor spinning, the fibres in the roving are separated, thus opened, and then wrapped and twisted as the yarn is drawn out of the rotor cup.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Charkha===\n<!-- Charkha (spinning wheel) redirects here -->\n[[File:Lady yarn in a Charkha in Bangalore.webm|thumb|A woman spinning with a charkha in MG Road Boulevard, Bangalore]]\nThe tabletop or floor charkha is one of the oldest known forms of the spinning wheel. The charkha works similarly to the great wheel, with a drive wheel being turned by hand, while the yarn is spun off the tip of the spindle. The floor charkha and the great wheel closely resemble each other. With both, the spinning must stop in order to wind the yarn onto the spindle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nThe word ''charkha'', which has links with [[Persian language|Persian]] \u0686\u0631\u062e: charKh, wheel, is related to the Sanskrit word for \"circle\" (''cakra''). The charkha was both a tool and a symbol of the [[Indian independence movement]]. The charkha, a small, portable, hand-cranked wheel, is ideal for spinning [[cotton]] and other fine, short-staple fibres, though it can be used to spin other fibres as well. The size varies, from that of a hardbound novel to the size of a briefcase, to a floor charkha. Leaders of the [[India's Freedom Struggle]] brought the charkha into wider use with their teachings. They hoped the charkha would assist the people of India achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and therefore used the charkha as a symbol of the Indian independence movement and included it on earlier versions of the [[Flag of India]].<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in-hist.html India: Historical Flags], Flags of the World</ref>\n\nDilasa Medical Trust (Mumbai, India) undertake the Charkha Spinning Projects wherein the volunteers spin the charkha and produce clothes. These clothes are then donated to the weaker sections of the society. Approximately 50 meters of cloth is produced annually from the cotton spun on the charkha. Also, uniforms of different sizes are made, sorted and distributed amongst needy students free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aniruddhafoundation.com/compassion-charkha-project/ |title=Charkha Project \u2013 Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation |publisher=Aniruddhafoundation.com |date= 2015-10-09|accessdate=2019-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/others/Spinning-beyond-freedom/articleshow/16043239.cms |title=Spinning beyond freedom |publisher=Mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Compact Charkha.jpg|thumb|Modified and portable compact charkha]]\n\n===Great wheel===\n\nThe great wheel was one of the earlier types of spinning wheel. The fibre is held in the left hand and the wheel slowly turned with the right. This wheel is thus good for using the [[long draw (spinning)|long-draw]] spinning technique, which requires only one active hand most of the time, thus freeing a hand to turn the wheel. The great wheel is usually used to spin short-staple fibres (this includes both cotton and wool), and can only be used with fibre preparations that are suited to long-draw spinning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Conner-prairie-spinning-wheel.jpg|thumb|left|Spinning [[wool]] on a great wheel at a demonstration in the [[Conner Prairie]] living history museum [[loom]] house]]\nThe great wheel is usually over {{convert|5|ft}} in height. The large drive wheel turns the much smaller spindle assembly, with the spindle revolving many times for each turn of the drive wheel. The yarn is spun at an angle off the tip of the spindle, and is then stored on the spindle. To begin spinning on a great wheel, first a leader (a length of waste yarn) is tied onto the base of the spindle and spiraled up to the tip. Then the spinner overlaps a handful of fibre with the leader, holding both gently together with the left hand, and begins to slowly turn the drive wheel clockwise with the right hand, while simultaneously walking backward and drawing the fibre in the left hand away from the spindle at an angle. The left hand must control the tension on the wool to produce an even result. Once a sufficient amount of yarn has been made, the spinner turns the wheel backward a short distance to unwind the spiral on the spindle, then turns it clockwise again, and winds the newly made yarn onto the spindle, finishing the wind-on by spiralling back out to the tip again to make another draw.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Treadle wheel===\n[[File:WHEELPARTS.jpg|thumb|Parts of a treadle wheel: A - Wheel, B - Drive band, C - Flyer assembly, D - Maiden, E - Bearings, F - Tension Screw, G - Treadle, H - Footman, I - Treadle connection, J - Treadle bar, K - Table, L - Distaff]]\nThis type of wheel is powered by the spinner's foot rather than their hand or a motor. The spinner sits and pumps a foot treadle that turns the drive wheel via a crankshaft and a connecting rod. This leaves both hands free for drafting the fibres, which is necessary in the [[short draw (spinning)|short draw]] spinning technique, which is often used on this type of wheel. The old-fashioned pointed driven spindle is not a common feature of the treadle wheel. Instead, most modern wheels employ a flyer-and-bobbin system which twists the yarn and winds it onto a spool simultaneously. These wheels can be single- or double-treadle; which is a matter of preference and does not affect the operation of the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Double drive====\n[[File:Double drive wheel.JPG|thumb|left|A double drive wheel]]\n\nThe double drive wheel is named after its drive band, which goes around the spinning wheel twice. The drive band turns the flyer, which is the horse-shoe shaped piece of wood surrounding the [[bobbin]], as well as the bobbin. Due to a difference in the size of the whorls (the round pieces or pulleys around which the drive band runs) the bobbin whorl, which has a smaller radius than the flyer whorl, turns slightly faster. Thus both the flyer and bobbin rotate to twist the yarn, and the difference in speed continually winds the yarn onto the bobbin.  Generally the speed difference or \"ratio\" is adjusted by the size of the whorls and the tension of the drive band.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe drive band on the double drive wheel is generally made from a non-stretch yarn or twine; candlewick is also used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}b\n\n====Single drive====\n[[File:Spinningwheel.JPG|thumb|A single-drive wheel with the drive band around flyer and brake on the bobbin]]\n\nA single drive wheel has one drive band that  the flywheel and the flyer, and a short tension band which goes only over the bobbin.  The tension band adds an adjustable amount of drag to the bobbin and thereby increases the yarn take up force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIf the tension band were extremely tight and the bobbin could not rotate at all, yarn would be taken up onto the bobbin by the rotation of the flyer constantly at a rate of one wrap per revolution of the flyer.  In practice, the tension is set such that the bobbin can slip, but with some drag, generating the differential rate of rotation between the flyer and the bobbin.  This drag is the force which winds new yarn onto the bobbin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}b\n\nWhile the spinner is making new yarn, the bobbin and the flyer turn in unison, driven by the single drive band. When the spinner feeds the yarn onto the bobbin, the drag on the flyer slows it and thus the yarn winds on. The tighter the tension band is, the more pull on the yarn, because the more friction the bobbin has to overcome to turn in sync with the flyer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Upright style====\nWhen the spindle or flyer is located above the wheel, rather than off to one side, the wheel is said to be an upright wheel. This type of wheel is often more compact, thus easier to store. Some upright wheels are even made to fold up small enough that they fit in carry-on luggage at the airport.\nAn Irish castle wheel is a type of upright in which the flyer is located below the drive wheel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Electric spinning wheel====\nElectric spinning wheels or e-spinners are powered by an electric motor rather than via a treadle. Some require mains power while others may be powered by a low-voltage source, such as a rechargeable battery.

It was fundamental to the cotton textile industry prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It laid the foundations for later machinery such as the [[spinning jenny]] and [[spinning frame]], which displaced the spinning wheel during the Industrial Revolution.\n\n==How it works==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nBasic spinning of yarn involves taking a clump of fibres and teasing a bit of them out, then twisting it into a basic string shape. You continue pulling and twisting to make it longer and longer, and to control the thickness. Thousands of years ago, people begin doing this onto a stick, called a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]], which is a very lengthy process.\n\nThe actual wheel part of a spinning wheel doesn't take place of the spindle, instead it automates the twisting process, allowing you to \"twist\" the thread without having to constantly do so manually, and also the size of the wheel lets you more finely control the amount of twist. The thread still ends up on a spindle, just as it did pre-wheel.\n\nThe wheel itself was originally free-moving, spun by a hand or foot reaching out and turning it directly. Eventually, simple mechanisms were created that let you simply push at a pedal and keep the wheel turning at an even more constant rate. This mechanism has been the main source of technological progress for the spinning wheel, before the 18th century.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Spinning wheel Charkhu in Maymand Museum.jpg|thumb|Spinning wheel Charkhu in [[Meymand, Kerman|Maymand]], Kerman, Iran]]\n[[File:Illustration of al-Hariri Maqamat spinning wheel.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al-Maqamat]], painted by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]] (1237)]]\n[[File:Wang Juzheng's Spinning Wheel, Close Up 2.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Spinning Wheel'', by [[History of Chinese art|Chinese artist]] Wang Juzheng, [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (c. 1270)<ref>Deng, Yingke and Pingxing Wang.

The first stage in mechanizing the process was mounting the spindle horizontally so it could be rotated by a cord encircling a large, hand-driven wheel. The great wheel is an example of this type, where the fibre is held in the left hand and the wheel slowly turned with the right. Holding the fibre at a slight angle to the spindle produced the necessary twist.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/spinning-wheel |chapter=Spinning wheel |title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title-link=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |volume=11 |edition=15 |year=1998 |page=99 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> The spun yarn was then wound onto the spindle by moving it so as to form a right angle with the spindle.

In 1533, a citizen of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] is said to have added a [[treadle]], by which the spinner could rotate her spindle with one foot and have both hands free to spin. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew a picture of the flyer, which twists the yarn before winding it onto the spindle. During the 16th century a treadle wheel with flyer was in common use, and gained such names as the Saxony wheel and the [[flax]] wheel. It sped up production, as one needn't stop spinning to wind up the yarn.\n\nAccording to [[Mark Elvin]], 14th-century Chinese technical manuals describe an automatic water-powered spinning wheel. Comparable devices were not developed in Europe until the 18th century. However, it fell into disuse when fibre production shifted from [[hemp]] to [[cotton]]. It was forgotten by the 17th century. The decline of the automatic spinning wheel in China is an important part of Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] theory to explain why there was no indigenous [[industrial Revolution]] in China despite its high levels of wealth and scientific knowledge.\n\n[[File:Mrs. Skindzierz- Jakubowska at the Spinning Wheel 1976.JPG|thumb|left|Elder citizen of [[Suwa\u0142ki]] region, [[Poland]] - Mrs. Skindzierz-Jakubowska (82) at the spinning wheel, 1976<ref>Picture made in the presbitery of [[\u017byliny]] parish near [[Suwa\u0142ki]], [[Poland]], september 1976 (phot.

[[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] first worked on the problem in 1738, patenting the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system, for drawing [[wool]] to a more even thickness. Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, yarn could be twisted and spun quickly and efficiently. However, they did not have much financial success. In 1771, Richard Arkwright used waterwheels to power looms for the production of cotton cloth, his invention becoming known as the water frame.\n\nMore modern spinning machines use a mechanical means to rotate the spindle, as well as an automatic method to draw out fibres, and devices to work many spindles together at speeds previously unattainable.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Newer technologies that offer even faster yarn production include friction spinning, an open-end system, and air jets.<ref name=Wayne>Cotton: Origin, History, Technology, and Production By C.

Until the acceptance of rotor spinning wheel, all yarns were produced by aligning fibres through drawing techniques and then twisting the fibre together. With rotor spinning, the fibres in the roving are separated, thus opened, and then wrapped and twisted as the yarn is drawn out of the rotor cup.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Charkha===\n<!-- Charkha (spinning wheel) redirects here -->\n[[File:Lady yarn in a Charkha in Bangalore.webm|thumb|A woman spinning with a charkha in MG Road Boulevard, Bangalore]]\nThe tabletop or floor charkha is one of the oldest known forms of the spinning wheel. The charkha works similarly to the great wheel, with a drive wheel being turned by hand, while the yarn is spun off the tip of the spindle. The floor charkha and the great wheel closely resemble each other. With both, the spinning must stop in order to wind the yarn onto the spindle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nThe word ''charkha'', which has links with [[Persian language|Persian]] \u0686\u0631\u062e: charKh, wheel, is related to the Sanskrit word for \"circle\" (''cakra''). The charkha was both a tool and a symbol of the [[Indian independence movement]]. The charkha, a small, portable, hand-cranked wheel, is ideal for spinning [[cotton]] and other fine, short-staple fibres, though it can be used to spin other fibres as well. The size varies, from that of a hardbound novel to the size of a briefcase, to a floor charkha. Leaders of the [[India's Freedom Struggle]] brought the charkha into wider use with their teachings. They hoped the charkha would assist the people of India achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and therefore used the charkha as a symbol of the Indian independence movement and included it on earlier versions of the [[Flag of India]].<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in-hist.html India: Historical Flags], Flags of the World</ref>\n\nDilasa Medical Trust (Mumbai, India) undertake the Charkha Spinning Projects wherein the volunteers spin the charkha and produce clothes.

This wheel is thus good for using the [[long draw (spinning)|long-draw]] spinning technique, which requires only one active hand most of the time, thus freeing a hand to turn the wheel. The great wheel is usually used to spin short-staple fibres (this includes both cotton and wool), and can only be used with fibre preparations that are suited to long-draw spinning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Conner-prairie-spinning-wheel.jpg|thumb|left|Spinning [[wool]] on a great wheel at a demonstration in the [[Conner Prairie]] living history museum [[loom]] house]]\nThe great wheel is usually over {{convert|5|ft}} in height. The large drive wheel turns the much smaller spindle assembly, with the spindle revolving many times for each turn of the drive wheel. The yarn is spun at an angle off the tip of the spindle, and is then stored on the spindle. To begin spinning on a great wheel, first a leader (a length of waste yarn) is tied onto the base of the spindle and spiraled up to the tip. Then the spinner overlaps a handful of fibre with the leader, holding both gently together with the left hand, and begins to slowly turn the drive wheel clockwise with the right hand, while simultaneously walking backward and drawing the fibre in the left hand away from the spindle at an angle. The left hand must control the tension on the wool to produce an even result. Once a sufficient amount of yarn has been made, the spinner turns the wheel backward a short distance to unwind the spiral on the spindle, then turns it clockwise again, and winds the newly made yarn onto the spindle, finishing the wind-on by spiralling back out to the tip again to make another draw.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Treadle wheel===\n[[File:WHEELPARTS.jpg|thumb|Parts of a treadle wheel: A - Wheel, B - Drive band, C - Flyer assembly, D - Maiden, E - Bearings, F - Tension Screw, G - Treadle, H - Footman, I - Treadle connection, J - Treadle bar, K - Table, L - Distaff]]\nThis type of wheel is powered by the spinner's foot rather than their hand or a motor. The spinner sits and pumps a foot treadle that turns the drive wheel via a crankshaft and a connecting rod. This leaves both hands free for drafting the fibres, which is necessary in the [[short draw (spinning)|short draw]] spinning technique, which is often used on this type of wheel. The old-fashioned pointed driven spindle is not a common feature of the treadle wheel. Instead, most modern wheels employ a flyer-and-bobbin system which twists the yarn and winds it onto a spool simultaneously. These wheels can be single- or double-treadle; which is a matter of preference and does not affect the operation of the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Double drive====\n[[File:Double drive wheel.JPG|thumb|left|A double drive wheel]]\n\nThe double drive wheel is named after its drive band, which goes around the spinning wheel twice. The drive band turns the flyer, which is the horse-shoe shaped piece of wood surrounding the [[bobbin]], as well as the bobbin. Due to a difference in the size of the whorls (the round pieces or pulleys around which the drive band runs) the bobbin whorl, which has a smaller radius than the flyer whorl, turns slightly faster. Thus both the flyer and bobbin rotate to twist the yarn, and the difference in speed continually winds the yarn onto the bobbin.  Generally the speed difference or \"ratio\" is adjusted by the size of the whorls and the tension of the drive band.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe drive band on the double drive wheel is generally made from a non-stretch yarn or twine; candlewick is also used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}b\n\n====Single drive====\n[[File:Spinningwheel.JPG|thumb|A single-drive wheel with the drive band around flyer and brake on the bobbin]]\n\nA single drive wheel has one drive band that  the flywheel and the flyer, and a short tension band which goes only over the bobbin.  The tension band adds an adjustable amount of drag to the bobbin and thereby increases the yarn take up force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIf the tension band were extremely tight and the bobbin could not rotate at all, yarn would be taken up onto the bobbin by the rotation of the flyer constantly at a rate of one wrap per revolution of the flyer.  In practice, the tension is set such that the bobbin can slip, but with some drag, generating the differential rate of rotation between the flyer and the bobbin.  This drag is the force which winds new yarn onto the bobbin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}b\n\nWhile the spinner is making new yarn, the bobbin and the flyer turn in unison, driven by the single drive band. When the spinner feeds the yarn onto the bobbin, the drag on the flyer slows it and thus the yarn winds on. The tighter the tension band is, the more pull on the yarn, because the more friction the bobbin has to overcome to turn in sync with the flyer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Upright style====\nWhen the spindle or flyer is located above the wheel, rather than off to one side, the wheel is said to be an upright wheel. This type of wheel is often more compact, thus easier to store. Some upright wheels are even made to fold up small enough that they fit in carry-on luggage at the airport.\nAn Irish castle wheel is a type of upright in which the flyer is located below the drive wheel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Electric spinning wheel====\nElectric spinning wheels or e-spinners are powered by an electric motor rather than via a treadle. Some require mains power while others may be powered by a low-voltage source, such as a rechargeable battery.  Most e-spinners are small and portable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOne of the attractions of an e-spinner is that it is not necessary to coordinate treadling with handling the fibre (drafting), so it is generally easier to learn to spin on an e-spinner than a traditional treadle-style spinning wheel.  E-spinners are also suitable for spinners who have trouble treadling for various reasons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Importance==\nThe spinning wheel increased the productivity of thread making by a factor of greater than 10.  Medieval historian [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap [[paper]], which in turn was a factor in the development of [[printing]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Marchetti\n | first1 = Cesare\n | author1-link =\n | title =A Postmortem Technology Assessment of the Spinning Wheel: The Last 1000 Years, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 13; pp. 91-93\n | year = 1978\n | url = http://www.cesaremarchetti.org/archive/scan/MARCHETTI-079.pdf\n }}</ref>\n\nIt was fundamental to the cotton textile industry prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks. Makeup can empower women in many ways. \n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin.

These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package.

The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].\n\nThe current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics.

They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry.

Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world.

These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release [[Male cosmetics|products specially tailored for men]], and men are increasingly using them.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nCosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and \"gifts with purchase\" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).\n\nA beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "name_user": "Madhabilata singha roy", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a line", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}

Gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components. In the first edition of his book ''Frames of Mind'' (1983), he described seven distinct types of intelligence\u2014logical-mathematical, [[Linguistic intelligence|linguistic]], [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|spatial]], musical, [[kinesthetic]], [[interpersonal]], and [[intrapersonal]]. In a second edition of this book, he added two more types of intelligence\u2014naturalist and existential intelligences. He argues that [[psychometric]] (IQ) tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence.<ref name=APA1995/> A major criticism of Gardner's theory is that it has never been tested, or subjected to peer review, by Gardner or anyone else, and indeed that it is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.cortland.edu/departments/psychology/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113020206/http://www.cortland.edu/psych/mi/critique.html|url-status=dead|title=Psychology Department - SUNY Cortland|archivedate=January 13, 2010|website=www2.cortland.edu}}</ref> Others (e.g. Locke, 2005) have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence (specific aptitude theory) implies a political\u2014rather than scientific\u2014agenda, intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals, rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities. Schmidt and Hunter (2004) suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability, or \"g\", has not received empirical support. On the other hand, [[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were \"useful fictions\", and went on to state that \"his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/10/27/state-of-the-child/|title=State of the Child|last=Bruner|first=Jerome S.|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHoward Gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows:<ref name=\"Gardner1993\">{{Cite book |title=Multiple Intelligences: The Theory in Practice, A Reader |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-465-01822-2 |authormask=Gardner, Howard |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/multipleintellig00gard_0 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Linguistic intelligence]]: People high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words, both spoken and written.\n* [[Logical-mathematical intelligence]]: It implies logical and mathematical abilities.\n* [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|Spatial intelligence]]: The ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model.\n* [[Musical intelligence]]: Those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch, and may even be [[absolute pitch]].\n* [[Physical intelligence|Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence]]: The ability to solve problems or to fashion products using one's whole body, or parts of the body.

Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed. Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly, but not entirely, novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task. Practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to, selection of, and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context. The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor; instead, the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence, and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood.\n\nMore recently, the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the Theory of Successful Intelligence by Sternberg.<ref name=Sternberg1999>{{Cite journal |author=Sternberg, R.J. |year=1978 |title=The theory of successful intelligence |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=3 |pages=292\u2013316 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.3.4.292 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Sternberg2003>{{Cite journal |author=Sternberg, R.J. |year=2003 |title=A broad view of intelligence: The theory of successful intelligence |journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research |volume=55 |pages=139\u2013154 |doi=10.1037/1061-4087.55.3.139 |issue=3}}</ref> Intelligence is now defined as an individual's assessment of success in life by the individual's own ([[nomothetic and idiographic|idiographic]]) standards and within the individual's sociocultural context. Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills. The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence: adapting to, shaping of, and selecting of one's environments. The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one's strengths and compensating or correcting for one's weaknesses.\n\nSternberg's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community.<ref name=Brody2003a>{{Cite journal |author=Brody, N. |year=2003 |title=Construct validation of the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test: Comment and reanalysis |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=319\u2013329 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00087-3 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Brody2003b>{{Cite journal |author=Brody, N. |year=2003 |title =What Sternberg should have concluded |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=339\u2013342 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00190-3 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Gottfredson2003a>{{Cite journal |author=Gottfredson, L.S. |year=2003 |title=Dissecting practical intelligence theory: Its claims and evidence |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=343\u2013397 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00085-5 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Gottfredson2003b>{{Cite journal |author=Gottfredson, L.S. |year=2003 |title=On Sternberg's 'Reply to Gottfredson{{'-}} |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=415\u2013424 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00024-2 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\n=== PASS theory of intelligence ===\n{{Main|PASS Theory of Intelligence}}\n\nBased on [[A. R. Luria]]'s (1966)<ref name=luria-1966>Luria, A. R. (1966). Higher cortical functions in man. New York: Basic Books.</ref> seminal work on the modularization of brain function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the [[PASS Theory of Intelligence]]<ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994>Das, J. P., Naglieri, J. A., & Kirby, J. R. (1994). Assessment of cognitive processes. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes. The first process is the Planning, which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention process, which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. The next two are called Simultaneous and Successive processing and they involve encoding, transforming, and retaining information. Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle, or the difference between 'he had a shower before breakfast' and 'he had breakfast before a shower.' Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) theory is heavily indebted to both Luria (1966,<ref name=luria-1966 /> 1973<ref name=luria-1973>Luria, A. R. (1973). The working brain: An introduction to neuropsychology.

As a child develops, increasingly more accurate models of the world are developed which enable the child to interact with the world better. One example being [[object permanence]] where the child develops a model where objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched.\n\nPiaget's theory described four main stages and many sub-stages in the development. These four main stages are:\n* sensory motor stage (birth-2yrs);\n* pre-operational stage (2yrs-7rs);\n* concrete operational stage (7rs-11yrs); and\n* formal operations stage (11yrs-16yrs)<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\">Piaget, J.

He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, \"Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have \"more\"; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly\".<ref>Piaget, J. (1953). The origin of intelligence in the child. New Fetter Lane, New York: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> Initially younger children were not studied, because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or because of the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\"/>\nBy the end of this experiment several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\"/>\n\nPiaget's theory has been criticized for the age of appearance of a new model of the world, such as object permanence, being dependent on how the testing is done (see the article on [[object permanence]]). More generally, the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kitchener | first1 = R.

Instead, the current perspective describes it as a general capacity, comprising not only cognitive, but motivational, social and behavioural aspects as well. These facets work together to perform numerous tasks. An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions, and aversive experiences that can compromise one's quality of thought and activity. The link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in [[self-efficacy]]. Bandura's theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations. Thus, the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly, averagely or excellently based on differences in self-efficacy.\n\nA key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively. These skills are dependent on processing of stimuli that is unclear and ambiguous. To learn the relevant concepts, individuals must be able to rely on the reserve of knowledge to identify, develop and execute options. They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences. Thus, a stable sense of self-efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations.<ref>Wood, R., & Bandura, A. (198913). Social cognitive theory of organizational management. ''Academy of Management Review'', 14, 361-384.</ref>\n\nTo summarize, Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self-efficacy in any field will avoid challenges. This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as ''personal threats''. When failure occurs, they recover from it more slowly than others, and credit it to an insufficient aptitude. \nOn the other hand, persons with high levels of self-efficacy hold a task-diagnostic aim that leads to effective performance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ce9a244c79c36dc844740b8721298ce2bd8832fe| journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 117\u2013148 | doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3}}</ref>\n\n=== Process, personality, intelligence and knowledge theory (PPIK) ===\n{{Expand section|1=more extensive and clear explanations|date=March 2018|small=no}}\n[[File:Development of intelligence with age.jpg|thumb|Predicted growth curves for ''Intelligence as process'', crystallized intelligence, occupational knowledge and avocational knowledge based on Ackerman's PPIK Theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\nDeveloped by Ackerman, the PPIK (process, personality, intelligence and knowledge) theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell, the [[#Investment theory|Investment theory]] and [[Donald O.

Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in ''[[g factor (psychometrics)|g factor]]''.\n\n=== Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory ===\n{{Main|Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory}}\n\nMany of the broad, recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]]. It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research. A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used. ''g'' is at the top. Under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:<ref name=Kaufman2009>IQ Testing 101, Alan S. Kaufman, 2009, Springer Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-0-8261-0629-2}}</ref>\n*Fluid intelligence (Gf): includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.\n*Crystallized intelligence (Gc): includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.\n*Quantitative reasoning (Gq): the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.\n*Reading & writing ability (Grw): includes basic reading and writing skills.\n*Short-term memory (Gsm): is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds.\n*Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr): is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.\n*Visual processing (Gv): is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.\n*Auditory processing (Ga): is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.\n*Processing speed (Gs): is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.\n*Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt): reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2\u20133 minutes). See [[Mental chronometry]].\nModern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment.\n\n''g'' was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n=== Controversies ===\nWhile not necessarily a dispute about the psychometric approach itself, there are several controversies regarding the results from psychometric research.\n\nOne criticism has been against the early research such as [[craniometry]].<ref name=mom>''The Mismeasure of Man'', Stephen Jay Gould, Norton, 1996</ref> A reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the [[Model T]].<ref name=Jensen1982>{{Cite journal |authorlink=Arthur Jensen |author=Jensen, A.R. |year=1982 |title=The debunking of scientific fossils and straw persons |journal=Contemporary Education Review |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=121\u2013135 |url= http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSeveral critics, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have been critical of ''g'', seeing it as a statistical artifact, and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities.<ref name=mom/><ref name=Schlinger2003>{{Cite journal |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2003 |title=The Myth of Intelligence |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201333 |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5001903843 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> The American Psychological Association's report \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\" stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that ''g'' is a statistical artifact is a minority one.\n\n== Intelligence across cultures ==\n[[Psychology|Psychologists]] have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying. [[Robert Sternberg]] is among the researchers who have discussed how one's culture affects the person's interpretation of intelligence, and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world. To negate this, psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence:\n# Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life, according to one's own definition of success, within one's sociocultural context.\n# Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems.\n# Creative intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations.\n# Practical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to experience for purposes of adaption, shaping and selection.<ref>''Intelligence and Culture'', Robert Sternberg, American Psychologist, American Psychological Association, 2004, Vol. 59, No. 5, pp. 325-338.</ref>\n\nAlthough typically identified by its western definition, multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world. In many Eastern cultures, intelligence is mainly related with one's social roles and responsibilities. A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others \u2014 although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in [[China]].\nIn several African communities, intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens. However, rather than through social roles, as in many Eastern cultures, it is exemplified through social responsibilities. For example, in the language of Chi-Chewa, which is spoken by some ten million people across central [[Africa]], the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility. Furthermore, within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well. One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills, [[deductive reasoning]] skills, and [[IQ|Intelligence quotient]] (IQ), while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a [[social conscience]], accept others for who they are, and be able to give advice or [[wisdom]].<ref>''Intelligence and Culture'', Robert Serpell, Handbook of Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 549-578.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Genius]]\n* [[Intellect]]\n* [[Neuroscience and intelligence#Humans|Neuroscience and intelligence \u00a7 Humans]]\n* [[Outline of human intelligence]]\n* [[Race and intelligence]]\n* [[Self-test of Intelligence]]\n* [[Sex and intelligence]]\n* [[Superintelligence]]\n* [[Theory of multiple intelligences]]\n* [[Volition (psychology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

Gottfredson]] (2006) has argued that the results of thousands of studies support the importance of IQ for school and [[job performance]] (see also the work of Schmidt & Hunter, 2004). She says that IQ also predicts or correlates with numerous other life outcomes. In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is lacking or very poor.<ref>Gottfredson, L. S. (2006).

Gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components. In the first edition of his book ''Frames of Mind'' (1983), he described seven distinct types of intelligence\u2014logical-mathematical, [[Linguistic intelligence|linguistic]], [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|spatial]], musical, [[kinesthetic]], [[interpersonal]], and [[intrapersonal]]. In a second edition of this book, he added two more types of intelligence\u2014naturalist and existential intelligences. He argues that [[psychometric]] (IQ) tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence.<ref name=APA1995/> A major criticism of Gardner's theory is that it has never been tested, or subjected to peer review, by Gardner or anyone else, and indeed that it is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.cortland.edu/departments/psychology/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113020206/http://www.cortland.edu/psych/mi/critique.html|url-status=dead|title=Psychology Department - SUNY Cortland|archivedate=January 13, 2010|website=www2.cortland.edu}}</ref> Others (e.g. Locke, 2005) have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence (specific aptitude theory) implies a political\u2014rather than scientific\u2014agenda, intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals, rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities. Schmidt and Hunter (2004) suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability, or \"g\", has not received empirical support. On the other hand, [[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were \"useful fictions\", and went on to state that \"his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/10/27/state-of-the-child/|title=State of the Child|last=Bruner|first=Jerome S.|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHoward Gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows:<ref name=\"Gardner1993\">{{Cite book |title=Multiple Intelligences: The Theory in Practice, A Reader |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-465-01822-2 |authormask=Gardner, Howard |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/multipleintellig00gard_0 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Linguistic intelligence]]: People high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words, both spoken and written.\n*[[Logical-mathematical intelligence]]: It implies logical and mathematical abilities.\n* [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|Spatial intelligence]]: The ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model.\n*[[Musical intelligence]]: Those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch, and may even be [[absolute pitch]].\n*[[Physical intelligence|Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence]]: The ability to solve problems or to fashion products using one's whole body, or parts of the body.

Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed. Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly, but not entirely, novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task. Practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to, selection of, and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context. The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor; instead, the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence, and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood.\n\nMore recently, the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the Theory of Successful Intelligence by Sternberg.<ref name=Sternberg1999>{{Cite journal |author=Sternberg, R.J. |year=1978 |title=The theory of successful intelligence |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=3 |pages=292\u2013316 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.3.4.292 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Sternberg2003>{{Cite journal |author=Sternberg, R.J. |year=2003 |title=A broad view of intelligence: The theory of successful intelligence |journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research |volume=55 |pages=139\u2013154 |doi=10.1037/1061-4087.55.3.139 |issue=3}}</ref> Intelligence is now defined as an individual's assessment of success in life by the individual's own ([[nomothetic and idiographic|idiographic]]) standards and within the individual's sociocultural context. Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills. The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence: adapting to, shaping of, and selecting of one's environments. The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one's strengths and compensating or correcting for one's weaknesses.\n\nSternberg's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community.<ref name=Brody2003a>{{Cite journal |author=Brody, N. |year=2003 |title=Construct validation of the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test: Comment and reanalysis |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=319\u2013329 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00087-3 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Brody2003b>{{Cite journal |author=Brody, N. |year=2003 |title =What Sternberg should have concluded |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=339\u2013342 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00190-3 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Gottfredson2003a>{{Cite journal |author=Gottfredson, L.S. |year=2003 |title=Dissecting practical intelligence theory: Its claims and evidence |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=343\u2013397 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00085-5 |issue=4}}</ref><ref name=Gottfredson2003b>{{Cite journal |author=Gottfredson, L.S. |year=2003 |title=On Sternberg's 'Reply to Gottfredson{{'-}} |journal=Intelligence |volume=31 |pages=415\u2013424 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00024-2 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\n=== PASS theory of intelligence ===\n{{Main|PASS Theory of Intelligence}}\n\nBased on [[A. R. Luria]]'s (1966)<ref name=luria-1966>Luria, A. R. (1966). Higher cortical functions in man. New York: Basic Books.</ref> seminal work on the modularization of brain function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the [[PASS Theory of Intelligence]]<ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994>Das, J. P., Naglieri, J. A., & Kirby, J. R. (1994). Assessment of cognitive processes. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes. The first process is the Planning, which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention process, which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. The next two are called Simultaneous and Successive processing and they involve encoding, transforming, and retaining information. Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle, or the difference between 'he had a shower before breakfast' and 'he had breakfast before a shower.' Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes.

As a child develops, increasingly more accurate models of the world are developed which enable the child to interact with the world better. One example being [[object permanence]] where the child develops a model where objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched.\n\nPiaget's theory described four main stages and many sub-stages in the development. These four main stages are:\n* sensory motor stage (birth-2yrs);\n* pre-operational stage (2yrs-7rs);\n* concrete operational stage (7rs-11yrs); and\n* formal operations stage (11yrs-16yrs)<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\">Piaget, J. (2001). Psychology of intelligence. Routledge.</ref>\nDegree of progress through these stages are correlated, but not identical with psychometric IQ.<ref name=\"Elkind, D. 1969\">Elkind, D., & Flavell, J. (1969).

He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, \"Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have \"more\"; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly\".<ref>Piaget, J. (1953). The origin of intelligence in the child. New Fetter Lane, New York: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> Initially younger children were not studied, because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or because of the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\"/>\nBy the end of this experiment several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.<ref name=\"Piaget, J. 2001\"/>\n\nPiaget's theory has been criticized for the age of appearance of a new model of the world, such as object permanence, being dependent on how the testing is done (see the article on [[object permanence]]). More generally, the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kitchener | first1 = R.

Instead, the current perspective describes it as a general capacity, comprising not only cognitive, but motivational, social and behavioural aspects as well. These facets work together to perform numerous tasks. An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions, and aversive experiences that can compromise one's quality of thought and activity. The link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in [[self-efficacy]]. Bandura's theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations. Thus, the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly, averagely or excellently based on differences in self-efficacy.\n\nA key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively. These skills are dependent on processing of stimuli that is unclear and ambiguous. To learn the relevant concepts, individuals must be able to rely on the reserve of knowledge to identify, develop and execute options. They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences. Thus, a stable sense of self-efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations.<ref>Wood, R., & Bandura, A. (198913). Social cognitive theory of organizational management. ''Academy of Management Review'', 14, 361-384.</ref>\n\nTo summarize, Bandura's theory of self-efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self-efficacy in any field will avoid challenges. This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as ''personal threats''. When failure occurs, they recover from it more slowly than others, and credit it to an insufficient aptitude. \nOn the other hand, persons with high levels of self-efficacy hold a task-diagnostic aim that leads to effective performance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ce9a244c79c36dc844740b8721298ce2bd8832fe| journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 117\u2013148 | doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3}}</ref>\n\n=== Process, personality, intelligence and knowledge theory (PPIK) ===\n{{Expand section|1=more extensive and clear explanations|date=March 2018|small=no}}\n[[File:Development of intelligence with age.jpg|thumb|Predicted growth curves for ''Intelligence as process'', crystallized intelligence, occupational knowledge and avocational knowledge based on Ackerman's PPIK Theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\nDeveloped by Ackerman, the PPIK (process, personality, intelligence and knowledge) theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell, the [[#Investment theory|Investment theory]] and [[Donald O.

The psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] early in the 20th century carried out the first formal [[factor analysis]] of [[correlation]]s between various test tasks. He found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other, which is called a ''positive manifold''. Spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests. Spearman named it ''g'' for \"[[general intelligence factor]]\". He interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that, to a larger or smaller degree, influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold. This interpretation of ''g'' as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics.

Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in ''[[g factor (psychometrics)|g factor]]''.\n\n=== Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory ===\n{{Main|Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory}}\n\nMany of the broad, recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]]. It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research. A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used. ''g'' is at the top. Under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:<ref name=Kaufman2009>IQ Testing 101, Alan S. Kaufman, 2009, Springer Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-0-8261-0629-2}}</ref>\n*Fluid intelligence (Gf): includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.\n*Crystallized intelligence (Gc): includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.\n*Quantitative reasoning (Gq): the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.\n*Reading & writing ability (Grw): includes basic reading and writing skills.\n*Short-term memory (Gsm): is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds.\n*Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr): is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.\n*Visual processing (Gv): is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.\n*Auditory processing (Ga): is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.\n*Processing speed (Gs): is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.\n*Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt): reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2\u20133 minutes). See [[Mental chronometry]].\nModern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment.\n\n''g'' was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n=== Controversies ===\nWhile not necessarily a dispute about the psychometric approach itself, there are several controversies regarding the results from psychometric research.\n\nOne criticism has been against the early research such as [[craniometry]].<ref name=mom>''The Mismeasure of Man'', Stephen Jay Gould, Norton, 1996</ref> A reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the [[Model T]].<ref name=Jensen1982>{{Cite journal |authorlink=Arthur Jensen |author=Jensen, A.R. |year=1982 |title=The debunking of scientific fossils and straw persons |journal=Contemporary Education Review |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=121\u2013135 |url= http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSeveral critics, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have been critical of ''g'', seeing it as a statistical artifact, and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities.<ref name=mom/><ref name=Schlinger2003>{{Cite journal |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2003 |title=The Myth of Intelligence |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201333 |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5001903843 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> The American Psychological Association's report \"[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]\" stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that ''g'' is a statistical artifact is a minority one.\n\n== Intelligence across cultures ==\n[[Psychology|Psychologists]] have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying. [[Robert Sternberg]] is among the researchers who have discussed how one's culture affects the person's interpretation of intelligence, and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world. To negate this, psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence:\n# Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life, according to one's own definition of success, within one's sociocultural context.\n# Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems.\n# Creative intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations.\n# Practical intelligence is the result of intelligence's components applied to experience for purposes of adaption, shaping and selection.<ref>''Intelligence and Culture'', Robert Sternberg, American Psychologist, American Psychological Association, 2004, Vol. 59, No. 5, pp. 325-338.</ref>\n\nAlthough typically identified by its western definition, multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world. In many Eastern cultures, intelligence is mainly related with one's social roles and responsibilities. A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others \u2014 although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in [[China]].\nIn several African communities, intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens. However, rather than through social roles, as in many Eastern cultures, it is exemplified through social responsibilities. For example, in the language of Chi-Chewa, which is spoken by some ten million people across central [[Africa]], the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility. Furthermore, within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well. One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills, [[deductive reasoning]] skills, and [[IQ|Intelligence quotient]] (IQ), while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a [[social conscience]], accept others for who they are, and be able to give advice or [[wisdom]].<ref>''Intelligence and Culture'', Robert Serpell, Handbook of Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 549-578.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Genius]]\n* [[Intellect]]\n* [[Neuroscience and intelligence#Humans|Neuroscience and intelligence \u00a7 Humans]]\n* [[Outline of human intelligence]]\n* [[Race and intelligence]]\n* [[Self-test of Intelligence]]\n* [[Sex and intelligence]]\n* [[Superintelligence]]\n* [[Theory of multiple intelligences]]\n* [[Volition (psychology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.\n\nAll states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401113644/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.\n\nThere are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]].

They also point towards its inability to incorporate other cultures. This rigidity leads to bizarre results. An example of this would be the fact that both fascist Adolf Hitler and libertarian Milton Friedman are on the \u201cfar right,\u201d yet Hitler advocated nationalism, socialism, militarism, authoritarianism, and anti-Semitism, while Milton Friedman advocated internationalism, capitalism, pacifism, civil liberties, and was himself a Jew. Another critic of political spectrum is its tendency to promote tribalism by needlessly sorting people into different groups.\n\nThere are also many alternatives to political spectrum and political compass. The popular among these being the ideological triangle i.e a way of organizing political ideology using the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The location of a political ideology on the triangle is a function of its preference for the three values. As one moves closer to the bottom corner, the preference for liberty increases. As one moves closer to the upper left-hand corner, the preference for equality increases. And as one moves closer to the upper right-hand corner, the preference for fraternity increases and political horseshoe i.e the '''horseshoe''' theory asserts that the far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear '''political''' continuum, closely resemble one another, analogous to the way that the opposite ends of a '''horseshoe''' are close together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Index of law articles]]\n* [[Index of politics articles]] \u2013 alphabetical list of political subjects\n* [[List of politics awards]]\n* [[List of years in politics]]\n* [[Outline of law]]\n* [[Outline of political science]] \u2013 structured list of political topics, arranged by subject area\n* [[Political lists]] \u2013 lists of political topics\n* [[Politics of present-day states]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|year=1981|last1=Connolly|first1=William|authorlink=William E.

States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.\n\nAll states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401113644/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.\n\nThere are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]].

Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993</ref>\n\n=== Critiques of political spectrum ===\nThe critics of political spectrum criticize the uni dimensional and bi-dimensional nature of it. They also point towards its inability to incorporate other cultures. This rigidity leads to bizarre results. An example of this would be the fact that both fascist Adolf Hitler and libertarian Milton Friedman are on the \u201cfar right,\u201d yet Hitler advocated nationalism, socialism, militarism, authoritarianism, and anti-Semitism, while Milton Friedman advocated internationalism, capitalism, pacifism, civil liberties, and was himself a Jew. Another critic of political spectrum is its tendency to promote tribalism by needlessly sorting people into different groups.\n\nThere are also many alternatives to political spectrum and political compass. The popular among these being the ideological triangle i.e a way of organizing political ideology using the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The location of a political ideology on the triangle is a function of its preference for the three values. As one moves closer to the bottom corner, the preference for liberty increases. As one moves closer to the upper left-hand corner, the preference for equality increases. And as one moves closer to the upper right-hand corner, the preference for fraternity increases and political horseshoe i.e the '''horseshoe''' theory asserts that the far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear '''political''' continuum, closely resemble one another, analogous to the way that the opposite ends of a '''horseshoe''' are close together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Index of law articles]]\n* [[Index of politics articles]] \u2013 alphabetical list of political subjects\n* [[List of politics awards]]\n* [[List of years in politics]]\n* [[Outline of law]]\n* [[Outline of political science]] \u2013 structured list of political topics, arranged by subject area\n* [[Political lists]] \u2013 lists of political topics\n* [[Politics of present-day states]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|year=1981|last1=Connolly|first1=William|authorlink=William E.

The [[comorbidity]] of HCoV-NL63 with other respiratory infections, has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint.

These population include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and [[immunocompromised]] individuals.

In more extreme and [[tropical climate]]s the virus has no preference toward a particular season.  Many studies have reported the co-occurrence of HCoV-NL63 with other [[human coronavirus]], ''[[Influenza A virus]]'', ''[[Human orthopneumovirus]]'' (RSV), [[parainfluenza virus]], and ''[[Human metapneumovirus]]'' (hMPV).<ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" />\n\n==Mechanism==\nTransmission of HCoV-NL63 is likely through droplet expulsion from the [[respiratory tract]], which may be airborne or spread through close personal contact.

Therefore, entrance into the cell is either through direct [[cell fusion]] with the [[plasma membrane]] or [[endocytosis]] followed by fusion with the membrane.  Due to the lack of a [[cDNA]] clone of HCoV-NL63, research on the replication cycle is limited.  Because it is a positive single-stranded [[RNA virus]], the processes of replication via [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]] can be carried out in the [[cytoplasm]] of the infected cell.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIt is difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by infection of the HCoV-NL63 virus and those caused by other common human viruses, making diagnosis and detection complex.

It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n[[File:Van Soest, Attack on the Medway.jpg|thumb|left|The 1667 [[Raid on the Medway]] severely damaged Charles' prestige]]\nLouis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], although he retained towns like [[Charleroi]] and [[Tournai]].

In June 1670 the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] was negotiated between Louis and Charles  using his sister [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta of Orl\u00e9ans]]; very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions. While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third. However, the French were inexperienced, their ships badly designed and co-operation with the English plagued by suspicion.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=38-39}} While Dutch numbers were further reduced by [[Admiralty of Friesland|Friesland]] retaining ships for defence against M\u00fcnster, better training gave them operational equality.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=231}} \n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], whose training compensated for numerical inferiority]]\nIn the battles of 1666, the Dutch were hampered by lack of familiarity with their new, much heavier, warships, the complex federal command system and conflict between [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Cornelis Tromp]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=181}} By 1672, these had been corrected, and De Ruyter's intensive training of his fleet in [[line-of-battle]] manoeuvres installed a new sense of coherence and discipline.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=278-279}}\n \nDutch ships were generally better gun platforms, whose shallow draft suited operations close to shore but were slow and less effective in open seas.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002 |pp=40-41}} Their maritime power was past its peak by the time of the [[Peace of Nijmegen]] in 1678: it had substantially declined in the preceding four years under the continuing stress of the [[Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch]] and [[Scanian War]]s which had prevented it strengthening its fleet, and because of qualitative improvements among its rivals.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=43-44, 68}}\n\nEngland provided two-thirds of an Anglo-French fleet of 98 'great ships and frigates', whose role was to gain control of Dutch waters, land an expeditionary force and attack its shipping. Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of [[Royal Scots|Dumbarton's]], a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.{{sfn|Childs|2014|p=16}}\n\nOpposition forced Charles to seek other sources of finance; in January 1672, he suspended [[Stop of the Exchequer|repayment of Crown debts]], which produced \u00a31.3&nbsp;million but had disastrous economic effects. Many [[City of London|London merchants]] were ruined and it shut off the short-term financing essential to international trade.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=80}} Shortly before the declaration of war, in late March he ordered an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort.{{sfn|Clodfelter|1992|p=46}}\n\nCharles and his ministers appreciated that an unprovoked war against the Protestant Netherlands an alliance with Catholic France would probably be unpopular, and that the Stop of the Exchequer of 2 January 1672 would make financiers in the City of London cautious about providing funds to the government to prosecute such a war. It was partly to increase the government's popularity among [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] merchants he issued [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] in 15 March.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=74}} In the event, the Declaration of Indulgence, which removed restrictions on Catholics as well as Nonconformists, did little to decrease hostility to the French alliance. This increased when Charles appointed his Catholic, pro-French brother [[James II of England|James]] was  naval commander, in place of his Protestant, anti-French uncle, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]].{{sfn|Kitson |1994|p=248}} Not only were merchants and Nonconformists unenthusiastic about the prospect of war, but the Royal Navy found it difficult to  recruit sufficient sailors to fully man the fleet.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=75}}\n\nHis chief minister, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], was instructed to \"break with (the Dutch), yet to lay the breach at their door\".{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}} This was done using manufactured incidents, including the [[HMS Merlin (1666)|Merlin affair]], which took place near [[Brielle|Brill]] in August 1671. The royal yacht {{HMS|Merlin|1666|2}} was ordered to sail through the Dutch fleet, who duly struck their flag in salute, but failed to fire white smoke, an honour afforded only to warships.{{sfn|Rowen|1978|pp=755-756}} A formal complaint to the States General was dismissed and few in England were even aware of the incident; its use as a pretext, combined with the attack on the Dutch convoy, led some English politicians to declare the conflict 'unjust'.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=74-75}} France declared war on 6 April, followed by England on 7 April.{{efn|Many sources incorrectly state the English were the first to declare war on 27 March, a mistake caused by the fact that they were still using the [[Julian calendar]], then ten days behind the [[Gregorian calendar]] in use at the Continent.

On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Li\u00e8ge; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of [[Maastricht]], crossed the [[Meuse]] and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of [[Rheinberg]], [[Orsoy]], Buderich and [[Wesel]].

A stream of venomous Orangist pamphlets accused the De Witt brothers in particular and the Regent regime in general of betraying the country to the French and of plotting against the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}} There was widespread rioting, with Orangists seizing control of city councils and demanding William take over government.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=163}} On 22 June, De Witt was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt.{{sfn|Rowen|1980|p=842}} One of the would-be assassins, Jacob van der Graaf, who was arrested and quickly tried and executed was popularly regarded as a martyr.

Louis originally agreed but success meant he no longer considered this compromise necessary.{{sfn|'t Hart|2014|pp=30-33}}\n\nOn 14 June, the States of Holland decided to ask peace terms from England and France, offering Louis the key fortresses in the south and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=86}} He responded with additional demands; either religious freedom for Catholics or sovereignty over [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Guelders]]. This was a deliberate delaying tactic; he knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}} The English were to be ceded [[Delfzijl]], in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], already besieged by M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}}\n\nDepicting Charles as the one man who could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to William's appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington, one of the few English politicians privy to the full content of Treaty of Dover, and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result. William was well-informed on English opposition and had assurances of Imperial support from Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's envoy in the Hague. Lisola arranged for Spanish troops to hold [['s-Hertogenbosch]] and [[Breda]], releasing their Dutch garrisons for the field army.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|pp=57-58}}\n\nWilliam rejected this offer, although he held out the possibility of a deal if Arlington and Buckingham could ease French demands. They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering the herring rights, \u00a3400,000, Sluys and [[Surinam]], in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace; the latter was clearly unacceptable.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=91}} Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis now required England also be ceded the islands of [[Voorne]], which contained the Dutch main naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]], and [[Goeree]]. These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little. Despite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=132}} at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=142}} In 1677, he forced his niece [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to marry William;{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=114}} this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n[[File:Van Soest, Attack on the Medway.jpg|thumb|left|The 1667 [[Raid on the Medway]] severely damaged Charles' prestige]]\nLouis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], although he retained towns like [[Charleroi]] and [[Tournai]].

While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third. However, the French were inexperienced, their ships badly designed and co-operation with the English plagued by suspicion.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=38-39}} While Dutch numbers were further reduced by [[Admiralty of Friesland|Friesland]] retaining ships for defence against M\u00fcnster, better training gave them operational equality.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=231}} \n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], whose training compensated for numerical inferiority]]\nIn the battles of 1666, the Dutch were hampered by lack of familiarity with their new, much heavier, warships, the complex federal command system and conflict between [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Cornelis Tromp]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=181}} By 1672, these had been corrected, and De Ruyter's intensive training of his fleet in [[line-of-battle]] manoeuvres installed a new sense of coherence and discipline.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=278-279}}\n \nDutch ships were generally better gun platforms, whose shallow draft suited operations close to shore but were slow and less effective in open seas.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002 |pp=40-41}} Their maritime power was past its peak by the time of the [[Peace of Nijmegen]] in 1678: it had substantially declined in the preceding four years under the continuing stress of the [[Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch]] and [[Scanian War]]s which had prevented it strengthening its fleet, and because of qualitative improvements among its rivals.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=43-44, 68}}\n\nEngland provided two-thirds of an Anglo-French fleet of 98 'great ships and frigates', whose role was to gain control of Dutch waters, land an expeditionary force and attack its shipping. Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of [[Royal Scots|Dumbarton's]], a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.{{sfn|Childs|2014|p=16}}\n\nOpposition forced Charles to seek other sources of finance; in January 1672, he suspended [[Stop of the Exchequer|repayment of Crown debts]], which produced \u00a31.3&nbsp;million but had disastrous economic effects. Many [[City of London|London merchants]] were ruined and it shut off the short-term financing essential to international trade.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=80}} Shortly before the declaration of war, in late March he ordered an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort.{{sfn|Clodfelter|1992|p=46}}\n\nCharles and his ministers appreciated that an unprovoked war against the Protestant Netherlands an alliance with Catholic France would probably be unpopular, and that the Stop of the Exchequer of 2 January 1672 would make financiers in the City of London cautious about providing funds to the government to prosecute such a war. It was partly to increase the government's popularity among [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] merchants he issued [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] in 15 March.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=74}} In the event, the Declaration of Indulgence, which removed restrictions on Catholics as well as Nonconformists, did little to decrease hostility to the French alliance. This increased when Charles appointed his Catholic, pro-French brother [[James II of England|James]] was  naval commander, in place of his Protestant, anti-French uncle, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]].{{sfn|Kitson |1994|p=248}} Not only were merchants and Nonconformists unenthusiastic about the prospect of war, but the Royal Navy found it difficult to  recruit sufficient sailors to fully man the fleet.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=75}}\n\nHis chief minister, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], was instructed to \"break with (the Dutch), yet to lay the breach at their door\".{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}} This was done using manufactured incidents, including the [[HMS Merlin (1666)|Merlin affair]], which took place near [[Brielle|Brill]] in August 1671. The royal yacht {{HMS|Merlin|1666|2}} was ordered to sail through the Dutch fleet, who duly struck their flag in salute, but failed to fire white smoke, an honour afforded only to warships.{{sfn|Rowen|1978|pp=755-756}} A formal complaint to the States General was dismissed and few in England were even aware of the incident; its use as a pretext, combined with the attack on the Dutch convoy, led some English politicians to declare the conflict 'unjust'.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=74-75}} France declared war on 6 April, followed by England on 7 April.{{efn|Many sources incorrectly state the English were the first to declare war on 27 March, a mistake caused by the fact that they were still using the [[Julian calendar]], then ten days behind the [[Gregorian calendar]] in use at the Continent.

On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Li\u00e8ge; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of [[Maastricht]], crossed the [[Meuse]] and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of [[Rheinberg]], [[Orsoy]], Buderich and [[Wesel]]. The last of these surrendered on 9 June, while troops from M\u00fcnster and Cologne simultaneously entered the provinces of [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]].{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=439}}\n\nOn 12 June, the French crossed the [[Lower Rhine]] into the [[Betuwe]] near [[Schenkenschanz|Schenkenschans]] and, recrossing the Lower Rhine to outflank the IJssel Line, occupied [[Arnhem]] on 16 June.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=83}} William's troops, in danger of being cut off from the core province of [[Holland]], retreated through [[Utrecht]] behind the [[The Dutch Water Line|Holland Water Line]], the inundations being released on 22 June.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=441}} Here the French advance stopped, although the line was not continuous and the Dutch had insufficient men to hold it.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=442}}\n\nDespite withdrawing its troops from the federal army, on 5 July the [[States of Overijssel]] surrendered to [[Bernhard von Galen]], Prince-Bishop of M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=92}} He then occupied [[Drenthe]], before reaching [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]; flooding prevented a proper siege and his troops were soon starving.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=245}}\n\nThe attack on the Smyrna Fleet led to the States General increasing the naval budget by 2.2&nbsp;million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] on 28 March, expanding the active fleet from forty-eight to sixty vessels and ordering the construction of thirty-six new vessels.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=157}} The Dutch fleet was considerably smaller than the combined Anglo-French fleet and De Ruyter initially withdrew into [[shoal]] waters near the Netherlands coast to await an opportunity to attack it successfully.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=50}} Needing a success, De Witt ordered De Ruyter to attack the Allied fleet, accompanied by his brother [[Cornelis de Witt]], to ensure the administration received credit for any victory.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=236}} When the combined Anglo-French fleet retired to Solebay near [[Southwold|Southwold, Norfolk]] to replenish its water and provisions, De Ruyter took advantage of its disorder to make a surprise attack in it at the [[Battle of Solebay]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=50}}\n[[File:The Burning of the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay, 28 May 1672 RMG BHC0302.tiff|left|thumb|Solebay, 7 June; the destruction of the ''[[HMS Royal James (1671)|Royal James]]'', the English flagship]]\nThe Duke of York led the English main and rear squadrons northwards against the main Dutch fleet but his French colleague [[Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]], who either misunderstood the Duke's intentions or deliberately ignored them, took his van squadron southwards.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=50}} There 30 French ships fought a separate encounter, engaging only in long-range fire with the 10 major and five small Dutch ships from the [[Admiralty of Zeeland]], commanded by [[Adriaen Banckert|Lieutenant-Admiral Banckert]]. D'Estr\u00e9es was condemned, both by English, and some of his own, officers for steering away from the Dutch and failing to engage them closely.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|pp=50-51}} The [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich|Earl of Sandwich]] was killed when the ''[[HMS Royal James (1671)|Royal James]]'' was sunk by fireships; losses were roughly equal but [[Battle of Solebay|Solebay]] was a significant Dutch strategic victory.{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=68}} The heavy English casualties at Solebay, the loss of the Royal James and the tragic death of the Earl of Sandwich all served to increase popular English opposition to the war,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=80}} and, for the rest of the year, lack of money to repair the damage incurred restricted English naval operations to a failed attack on the [[Dutch East India Company]] Return Fleet.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=82}} The Dutch retained control of their coastal waters, secured their trade routes and ended prospects of an Anglo-French landing in [[Zeeland|Zealand]].\n\nHowever, on the Dutch side, these naval success did not offset the damage to Dutch morale caused by defeats on land and it was impossible to hide the gravity of the crisis in the Netherlands in the summer of 1672. A stream of venomous Orangist pamphlets accused the De Witt brothers in particular and the Regent regime in general of betraying the country to the French and of plotting against the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}} There was widespread rioting, with Orangists seizing control of city councils and demanding William take over government.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=163}} On 22 June, De Witt was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt.{{sfn|Rowen|1980|p=842}} One of the would-be assassins, Jacob van der Graaf, who was arrested and quickly tried and executed was popularly regarded as a martyr. His execution only increased popular hatred against the De Witt brothers.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=82}}\n\n=== Negotiations ===\n[[File:Moord op de gebroeders De Witt, door Pieter Frits (1627-1708).jpg|thumb|right|The murder of the De Witt brothers secured William's domestic position]]\nThe Dutch were helped by the incompatibility of French and English objectives, arising from then dominant economic theory of [[mercantilism]]; this argued trade was a finite resource, so increasing your share meant taking it from others.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothbard|first1=Murray|title=Mercantilism as the Economic Side of Absolutism|url=https://mises.org/library/mercantilism-economic-side-absolutism|website=Mises.org|accessdate=2 October 2019|date=23 April 2010}}</ref> French economic power therefore required the destruction or acquisition of Holland but this threatened English trade and security and led to the demand by Charles that William be made Prince of a sovereign state of Holland. Louis originally agreed but success meant he no longer considered this compromise necessary.{{sfn|'t Hart|2014|pp=30-33}}\n\nOn 14 June, the States of Holland decided to ask peace terms from England and France, offering Louis the key fortresses in the south and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=86}} He responded with additional demands; either religious freedom for Catholics or sovereignty over [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Guelders]]. This was a deliberate delaying tactic; he knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}} The English were to be ceded [[Delfzijl]], in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], already besieged by M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}}\n\nDepicting Charles as the one man who could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to William's appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington, one of the few English politicians privy to the full content of Treaty of Dover, and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result. William was well-informed on English opposition and had assurances of Imperial support from Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's envoy in the Hague. Lisola arranged for Spanish troops to hold [['s-Hertogenbosch]] and [[Breda]], releasing their Dutch garrisons for the field army.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|pp=57-58}}\n\nWilliam rejected this offer, although he held out the possibility of a deal if Arlington and Buckingham could ease French demands. They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering the herring rights, \u00a3400,000, Sluys and [[Surinam]], in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace; the latter was clearly unacceptable.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=91}} Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis now required England also be ceded the islands of [[Voorne]], which contained the Dutch main naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]], and [[Goeree]]. These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little. Despite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=132}} at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=142}} In 1677, he forced his niece [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to marry William;{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=114}} this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.
