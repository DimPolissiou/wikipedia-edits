It is located in '''[[Kalaw Township]]''' which is part of '''[[Taunggyi District]]'''. \nIt lies at the elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to '''[[Yangon]]''', '''[[Mandalay]]''', '''[[Karen State]]''' and '''[[Mon State]]'''.\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by '''[[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]]'''.\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named Mingalar Lake in Bahtoo Park. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of '''[[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]]''' and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through Aungpan is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition.
