It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> The decision to release the single allowed Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> To help Jackson find ideas for recording, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer's seventh album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]'' was being developed.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> The decision to release the single allowed Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> To help Jackson find ideas for recording, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer's seventh album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]'' was being developed.

Jam noted that Jackson wrote lyrics for the song over one night, while he came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg, which was initially conceived as a \"slow melody\" but decided to be sped up.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you' while Jackson wrote 'Doesn't really matter'. Both Jam and Jackson decided to use Jackson's chorus, which Jackson also decided to include Jam's chorus towards the end of the song after she did not want to discard it.<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack, which he chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing that it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\". A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" is lyrically inspired by Jackson's character in the film, who falls in love with the main character.

The movement's initial goal was to separate the [[State (polity)|state]] from sexual matters such as [[marriage]], [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.<ref>McElroy, Wendy. \"The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.\" Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Principles==\nMuch of the free love tradition reflects a [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s (or persons at or above the [[age of consent]]) are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure without social or legal restraints. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.<ref>[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004631/http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 |date=14 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to today's stereotype, earlier middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. To this mentality are attributed strongly-defined gender roles, which led to a minority reaction in the form of the free-love movement.<ref name=\"Spurlock, John C 1988\">Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.</ref>\n\nWhile the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that sexual relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.\n\nThe term \"sex radical\" is also used interchangeably with the term \"free lover\", and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of \"free love\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forced sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\">Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago, IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.</ref>\n\nLaws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[:adultery]] and [[:divorce]], as well as [[:age of consent]], [[:birth control]], [[:homosexuality]], [[:abortion]], and sometimes [[:prostitution]]; although not all free-love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern\u2014for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. <!--the meaning of the preceding sentence is unclear. Does this mean Free Love advocates support of greater individual rights within marriage, or does free love abrogate such rights? Of course it is the former, but the preceding sentence should be rewritten to reflect this more clearly, especially for readers with shorter attention spans or for whom English is not one's first language.-->Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, some free-love proponents extended the critique of marriage to argue that marriage as a social institution encourages emotional possessiveness and psychological enslavement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Relationship to feminism===\n{{See also|Sex-positive feminism}}\nThe history of free love is entwined with the history of [[feminism]]. From the late 18th century, leading feminists, such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], have challenged the institution of marriage, and many have advocated its abolition.<ref name=\"historyguide1\">Kreis, Steven. \"Mary Wollstonecraft, 1759\u20131797\". The History Guide. 23 November 2009 <http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html>.</ref>\n\nAccording to feminist critique, a married woman was solely a wife and mother, denying her the opportunity to pursue other occupations; sometimes this was legislated, as with bans on married women and mothers being employed as [[teacher]]s. In 1855, free love advocate [[Mary Gove Nichols]] (1810\u20131884) described marriage as the \"annihilation of woman,\" explaining that women were considered to be men's property in law and public sentiment, making it possible for tyrannical men to deprive their wives of all freedom.<ref name=\"Gove-NicholsAuto1855\">{{cite book |title=Mary Lyndon, or Revelations of a Life.

Passet, ''Grassroots feminists: women, free love, and the power of print'' (1999), p. 119</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century at least six books endorsed the concept of free love, all of which were written by men. However of the four major free-love periodicals following the U. S. civil war, half had female editors. [[Mary Gove Nichols]] was the leading-female advocate and the woman most looked up to in the free-love movement. Her autobiography  ([https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100590392 ''Mary Lyndon: Or, Revelations of a Life: An Autobiography''], 1860) became the first argument against marriage written from a woman's point of view.<ref name=\"Spurlock, John 1994\">Spurlock, John. \"A Masculine View of Women's Freedom: Free Love in the Nineteenth Century.\" International Social Science Review 69.3/4 (1994): 34\u201345. Print.</ref>\n\nTo proponents of free love, the act of sex was not just about reproduction. Access to [[birth control]] was considered a means to women's independence, and leading birth-control activists also embraced free love. Sexual radicals remained focused on their attempts to uphold a woman's right to control her body and to freely discuss issues such as [[contraception]], marital-sex abuse (emotional and physical), and [[sexual education]]. These people believed that by talking about female sexuality, they would help empower women. To help achieve this goal, such radical thinkers relied on the written word, books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and by these means the movement was sustained for over fifty years, spreading the message of free love all over the United States.<ref>Passet, Joanne E.

Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Adamites]] were a sect that rejected marriage. Pictured, they are being rounded up for their heretical views.]]\nA number of utopian social movements throughout history have shared a vision of free love. The all-male [[Essenes]], who lived in the Middle East from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD apparently shunned sex, marriage, and slavery.<ref>See [[Essenes#Contemporary ancient sources]]</ref> They also renounced wealth, lived communally, and were pacifist<ref>Although they appear to have been involved in a revolt against the Roman occupiers</ref> vegetarians.  An [[Early Christian]] sect known as the [[Adamites]] existed in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries and rejected marriage. They practiced [[nudism]] and believed themselves to be without [[original sin]].\n\nIn the 6th century, adherents of [[Mazdakism]] in pre-Muslim [[Persia]] apparently supported a kind of free love in the place of marriage,<ref>Crone, Patricia, ''Kavad's Heresy and Mazdak's Revolt'', in: Iran 29 (1991), S. 21\u201340</ref> and like many other free-love movements{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, also favored vegetarianism, [[pacificism]], and [[communalism]]. Some writers have posited a conceptual link between the rejection of [[private property]] and the rejection of marriage as a form of ownership{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. One folk story from the period that contains a mention of a free-love (and [[Naturism|nudist]]) community under the sea is \"The Tale of Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\" from ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 8th century).<ref>Irwin, Robert, ''Political Thought in The Thousand and One Nights'', in: Marvels & Tales \u2013 Volume 18, Number 2, 2004, pp. 246\u2013257.

I: Kommunistische Bewegungen in Mittelalter'', Stuttgart: J.W. Dietz.</ref> Typical of such movements, the [[Cathar]]s of 10th to 14th century Western Europe freed followers from all moral prohibition and religious obligation, but respected those who lived simply, avoided the taking of human or animal life, and were celibate. Women had an uncommon equality and autonomy, even as religious leaders. The Cathars and similar groups (the [[Waldenses]], Apostle brothers, [[Beghards]] and [[Beguines]], [[Lollards]], and [[Hussites]]) were branded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the Roman Catholic Church and suppressed. Other movements shared their critique of marriage but advocated free sexual relations rather than celibacy, such as the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], [[Taborite]]s, and [[Picards]].\n\n===Enlightenment thought===\n[[File:Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy G plate 01.jpg|thumb|right|237px|upright|Frontispiece to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'' (1793), which contains Blake's critique of Judeo-Christian values of marriage.

Theotormon (right) and Oothoon are in love, but Theotormon is unable to act, considering her polluted, and ties himself into knots of indecision.]]\nThe challenges to traditional morality and religion brought by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the emancipatory politics of the [[French Revolution]] created an environment where ideas such as free love could flourish. A group of [[Political radicalism|radical]] intellectuals in England (sometimes known as the English [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]), who supported the [[French Revolution]] developed early ideas about [[feminism]] and free love.\n\nNotable among them was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[William Blake]], who explicitly compared the sexual oppression of marriage to [[slavery]] in works such as ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' (1793). Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of [[chastity]] as a virtue.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake Poetry Foundation's bio of William Blake]</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E.

Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n{{poemquote|\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n}}\n\nBlake believed that humans were \"fallen\", and that a major impediment to a free love society was corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> He also seems to have thought that marriage should afford the joy of love, but that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy.\n\n[[File:Vindication1b.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Title page reads \"A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICUTRES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS. BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII.\"|Title page from ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], an early feminist and proponent of free love.]]\nAnother member of Blake's circle was the pioneering English feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband and early anarchist, [[William Godwin]]. The ideals of free love found their champion in one of the earliest [[feminism|feminists]]. In her writings, Wollstonecraft challenged the institution of marriage, and advocated its abolition. Her novels criticized the social construction of marriage and its effects on women. In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' written in 1788, the heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons. She finds love in relationships with another man and a woman. The novel, ''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'', never finished but published in 1798, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an asylum by her husband; Maria finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate. Mary makes it clear that \"women had strong [[sexual desire]]s and that it was degrading and immoral to pretend otherwise.\"<ref name=\"historyguide1\"/>\n\nWollstonecraft felt that women should not give up freedom and control of their sexuality, and thus didn't marry her partner, [[Gilbert Imlay]], despite the two conceiving and having a child together in the midst of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] of the French Revolution. Though the relationship ended badly, due in part to the discovery of Imlay's infidelity, and not least because Imlay abandoned her for good, Wollstonecraft's belief in free love survived. She later developed a relationship with Godwin, who shared her free love ideals, and published on the subject throughout his life. However, the two did decide to marry, just days before her death due to complications at [[childbirth|parturition]].\n\nIn an act understood to support free love, their child, [[Mary Shelley|Mary]], took up with the then still-married English romantic poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] at a young age. Shelley wrote in defence of free love (and vegetarianism) in the prose notes of ''[[Queen Mab]]'' (1813), in his essay ''On Love'' (c. 1815). and in the poem ''[[Epipsychidion]]'' (1821):\n\n{{poemquote|I never was attached to that great sect,\nWhose doctrine is, that each one should select\nOut of the crowd a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion ...\n\nTrue love has this, different from gold and clay,\nThat to divide is not to take away.}}\n\n===Utopian socialism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSharing the free-love ideals of the earlier social movements\u2014as well as their feminism, pacifism, and simple communal life\u2014were the [[utopian socialist]] communities of early-nineteenth-century France and Britain, associated with writers and thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]] in France, and [[Robert Owen]] in England. Fourier, who coined the term ''feminism,'' argued that true freedom could only occur without masters, without the ethos of work, and without suppressing passions: the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.\n\n[[Robert Owen]] argued that marriage formed one of an \"awful trinity\" of oppressors to mankind, as well as [[religion]] and private property, and his son [[Robert Dale Owen|Robert Dale]] was a leading proponent of free divorce. The Saint-Simonian feminist [[Pauline Roland]] took a free-love stance against marriage, having four children in the 1830s, all of whom bore her name.\n\nThe German composer [[Richard Wagner]] advocated something like free love in several of his works, and began a family with [[Cosima Liszt]], then still married to the conductor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. Though apparently scandalous at the time, such liaisons seemed the actions of admired artists who were following the dictates of their own wills, rather than those of social convention, and in this way they were in step with their era's liberal philosophers of the cult of passion, such as Fourier, and their actual or eventual openness can be understood to be a prelude to the freer ways of the twentieth century. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke occasionally in favor of something like free love, but when he proposed marriage to that famous practitioner of it, [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], she berated him for being inconsistent with his philosophy of the free and supramoral Superman, a criticism that Nietzsche seems to have taken seriously, or to have at least been stung by. The relationship between composer [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and writer [[George Sand]] can be understood as exemplifying free love in a number of ways. Behavior of this kind by figures in the public eye did much to erode the credibility of conventionalism in relationships, especially when such conventionalism brought actual unhappiness to its practitioners.\n\n===Origins of the movement===\nThe eminent sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] argued in his ''Principles of Sociology'' for the implementation of free divorce. Claiming that marriage consists of two components, \"union by law\" and \"union by affection\", he argued that with the loss of the latter union, legal union should lose all meaning and dissolve automatically, without the legal requirement for a divorce.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmpMZ7K2L3YC|title=\"A Revolution in Christian Morals\": Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15.

Postcard of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] from 1907.]]\nFree love began to coalesce into a movement in the mid to late 19th century. The term was coined by the Christian socialist writer [[John Humphrey Noyes]], although he preferred to use the term '[[Group marriage|complex marriage]]'. Noyes founded the [[Oneida Community]] in 1848, a utopian community that \"[rejected] conventional marriage both as a form of legalism from which Christians should be free and as a selfish institution in which men exerted rights of ownership over women\". He found scriptural justification: \"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven\" (Matt. 22:30).<ref>William Blake before him had made the same connection: \"In Eternity they neither marry nor are given in marriage.\" ([[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion]], 30.15; E176)</ref> Noyes also supported [[eugenics]]; and only certain people (including Noyes himself) were allowed to become parents. Another movement was established in [[Berlin Heights, Ohio]].\n\nIn 1852, a writer named Marx Edgeworth Lazarus published a tract entitled \"Love vs. Marriage pt. 1,\" in which he portrayed marriage as \"incompatible with social harmony and the root cause of mental and physical impairments.\"  Lazarus intertwined his writings with his religious teachings, a factor that made the Christian community more tolerable to the free love idea.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\"/> Elements of the free-love movement also had links to [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movements, drawing parallels between slavery and \"[[sexual slavery]]\" (marriage), and forming alliances with black activists.\n\nAmerican feminist [[Victoria Woodhull]] (1838\u20131927), the first woman to run for presidency in the U.S. in 1872, was also called \"the high priestess of free love\". In 1871, Woodhull wrote: \"Yes, I am a Free Lover.

[[Moses Harman]]) and the German-language Detroit newspaper ''Der Arme Teufel'' (ed. Robert Reitzel). Organisations included the New England Free Love League, founded with the assistance of American libertarian [[Benjamin Tucker]] as a spin-off from the New England Labor Reform League (NELRL). A minority of [[freethought|freethinkers]] also supported free love.<ref>Kirkley, Evelyn A. 2000. ''Rational Mothers and Infidel Gentlemen: Gender and American Atheism, 1865\u20131915.''

The first volume consisted of twenty writers, of which only one was a woman.<ref name=\"Spurlock, John 1994\"/>\n\nSex radicals were not alone in their fight against marriage ideals. Some other nineteenth-century Americans saw this social institution as flawed, but hesitated to abolish it. Groups such as the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Latter-day Saints were wary of the social notion of marriage. These organizations and sex radicals believed that true equality would never exist between the sexes as long as the church and the state continued to work together, worsening the problem of subordination of wives to their husbands.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\"/>\n\nFree-love movements continued into the early 20th century in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circles in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. A group of Villagers lived free-love ideals and promoted them in the political journal ''[[The Masses]]'' and its sister publication ''[[The Little Review]],'' a literary journal. Incorporating influences from the writings of the English thinkers and activists [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis]], women such as [[Emma Goldman]] campaigned for a range of sexual freedoms, including homosexuality and access to contraception. Other notable figures among the Greenwich-Village scene who have been associated with free love include [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Max Eastman]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Floyd Dell]], [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]], [[Ida Rauh]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[Neith Boyce]]; a certain extreme was reached by self-proclaimed Satanist [[Anton LaVey]]. [[Dorothy Day]] also wrote passionately in defense of free love, women's rights, and contraception\u2014but later, after converting to Catholicism, she criticized the sexual revolution of the sixties.\n\nThe development of the idea of free love in the United States was also significantly impacted by the publisher of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine, [[Hugh Hefner]], whose activities and persona over more than a half century popularized the idea of free love to the general public.{{clear}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Havelock Ellis]] was a pioneer [[sexology|sexologist]] and advocate of free love.]]\nFree love was a central tenet of the philosophy of the [[Fellowship of the New Life]], founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]].<ref>{{cite web|first=James A.|last=Good|url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/TD.html|title=The Development of Thomas Davidson's Religious and Social Thought}}</ref> Fellowship members included many illustrious intellectuals of the day, who went on to radically challenge accepted Victorian notions of morality and sexuality, including poets [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]], animal rights activist [[Henry Stephens Salt]],<ref>George Hendrick, ''Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters'', University of Illinois Press, pg. 47 (1977).</ref> sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], feminists [[Edith Ellis|Edith Lees]], [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and [[Annie Besant]] and writers [[H.

He became interested in progressive education, especially providing information to young people on the topic of sexual education. For Carpenter, sexual education meant forwarding a clear analysis of the ways in which sex and gender were used to oppress women, contained in Carpenter's radical work ''Love's Coming-of-Age''. In it he argued that a just and equal society must promote the sexual and [[economic freedom]] of women. The main crux of his analysis centred on the negative effects of the institution of marriage. He regarded marriage in England as both enforced celibacy and a form of prostitution.\n\n[[File:Carpenter1875.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Edward Carpenter]] in 1875.]]\nHe did not believe women would truly be free until a socialist society was established.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In contrast to many of his contemporaries, however, this led him to conclude that all oppressed workers should support women's emancipation, rather than to subordinate women's rights to male worker's rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He remarked, \"... there is no solution except the freedom of woman - which means, of course, the freedom of the masses of the people, men and women, and the ceasing altogether of economic slavery. There is no solution which will not include the redemption of the terms free women and free love to their true and rightful significance. Let every woman whose heart bleeds for the sufferings of her sex, hasten to declare herself and to constitute herself, as far as she possibly can, a free woman.\"\n\nThe best-known British advocate of free love was the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], later Third Earl Russell, who said that he did not believe he really knew a woman until he had made love with her. Russell consistently addressed aspects of free love throughout his voluminous writings, and was not personally content with conventional [[Monogamy]] until extreme old age. His most famous work on the subject was  ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'', published in 1929. The book heavily criticizes the [[Victorian morality|Victorian notions of morality]] regarding sex and marriage. Russell argued that the laws and ideas about sex of his time were a potpourri from various sources, which were no longer valid with the advent of [[contraception]], as the sexual acts are now separated from the conception. He argued that family is most important for the welfare of children, and as such, a man and a woman should be considered bound only after her first pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787544,00.html \"Sex Seer\"], in ''Time'', 4 November 1929</ref>\n\n\n''Marriage and Morals'' prompted vigorous protests and denunciations against Russell shortly after the book's publication.<ref name=SexEdPioneers>{{cite web|title=Pioneers of Sex Education |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |author=Haeberle, Erwin J. |year=1983 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313020717/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |archivedate=13 March 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> A decade later, the book cost him his professorial appointment at the [[City College of New York]] due to a court judgment that his opinions made him \"morally unfit\" to teach.<ref name=Denied>{{cite web|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell |author=Leberstein, Stephen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |publisher=Academe |date=November\u2013December 2001 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004082928/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |archivedate=4 October 2008 }}</ref> Contrary to what many people believed, Russell did not advocate an extreme [[libertine]] position. Instead, he felt that sex, although a natural impulse like hunger or thirst, involves more than that, because no one is \"satisfied by the bare sexual act\". He argued that abstinence enhances the pleasure of sex, which is better when it \"has a large psychical element than when it is purely physical\".<ref name=\"Hauerwas\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEKu6SoJR6cC|title=After Christendom?: How the Church Is to Behave If Freedom, Justice, and a Christian Nation Are Bad Ideas|author=Stanley Hauerwas|year=2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426722011}}</ref>\n\nRussell noted that for a marriage to work requires that there \"be a feeling of complete equality on both sides; there must be no interference with mutual freedom; there must be the most complete physical and mental intimacy; and there must be a certain similarity in regard to standards of value\".

The English-born anarchist, [[Chummy Fleming]] founded the [[Melbourne Anarchist Club]] in 1886, which led a debate on the topic of free love, and a couple of years later released an anonymous pamphlet on the subject:  'Free Love\u2014Explained and Defended' (possibly written by [[David Andrade]] or [[Chummy Fleming]]). The view of the Anarchist Club was formed in part as a reaction to the infamous [[Whitechapel murders]] by the notorious [[Jack the Ripper]]; his atrocities were at the time popularly understood by some\u2014at least, by anarchists\u2014to be a violation of the freedom of certain extreme classes of \"working women,\" but by extension of all women.\n\n[[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] libertarian [[Alice Winspear]], the wife of pioneer socialist [[William Robert Winspear]], wrote: \"Let us have freedom\u2014freedom for both man and woman\u2014freedom to earn our bread in whatever vocation is best suited to us, and freedom to love where we like, and to live only with those whom we love, and by whom we are loved in return.\" A couple of decades later, the [[Melbourne]] anarchist [[List of feminist poets|feminist poet]] [[Lesbia Harford]] also championed free love.\n\n====France====\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[\u00c9mile Armand]]]]\nIn the bohemian districts of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]], many were determined to shock the \"[[bourgeois]]\" sensibilities of the society they grew up in; many, such as the anarchist [[Beno\u00eet Broutchoux]], favored free love. At the same time, the [[cross-dressing]] radical activist [[Madeleine Pelletier]] practised celibacy, distributed birth-control devices and information, and performed abortions.\n\nAn important propagandist of free love was [[individualist anarchist]] [[\u00c9mile Armand]]. He advocated [[naturism]] and [[polyamory]] in what he termed ''la camaraderie amoureuse''.<ref name=\"armand\">[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf \"Emile Armand and la camaraderie amourouse \u2013 Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy.\" by Francis Rousin] Retrieved 10 June 2010</ref> He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject such as \"De la libert\u00e9 sexuelle\" (1907) where he advocated not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called \"plural love\".<ref name=\"armand\"/> In the individualist anarchist journal ''L'en dehors'' he and others continued in this way. Armand seized this opportunity to outline his theses supporting revolutionary sexualism and camaraderie amoureuse that differed from the traditional views of the partisans of free love in several respects.\n\nLater Armand submitted that from an individualist perspective nothing was reprehensible about making \"love\", even if one did not have very strong feelings for one's partner.<ref name=\"armand\"/> \"The camaraderie amoureuse thesis\", he explained, \"entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.\"<ref name=\"armand\"/> He also published ''Le Combat contre la jalousie et le sexualisme r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (1926), followed over the years by ''Ce que nous entendons par libert\u00e9 de l'amour'' (1928), ''La Camaraderie amoureuse ou \"chiennerie sexuelle\"'' (1930), and, finally, ''La R\u00e9volution sexuelle et la camaraderie amoureuse'' (1934), a book of nearly 350 pages comprising most of his writings on sexuality.<ref name=\"armand\"/> In a text from 1937, he mentioned among the individualist objectives the practice of forming [[voluntary association]]s for purely sexual purposes of heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual nature or of a combination thereof.\n\nHe also supported the right of individuals to change sex and stated his willingness to rehabilitate forbidden pleasures, non-conformist caresses (he was personally inclined toward voyeurism), as well as sodomy. This led him to allocate more and more space to what he called \"the sexual non-conformists\", while excluding physical violence.<ref name=\"armand\"/> His militancy also included translating texts from people such as [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] and establishments of free love associations which tried to put into practice ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' through actual sexual experiences.\n\nFree love advocacy groups active during this time included the ''Association d'\u00c9tudes sexologiques'' and the ''Ligue mondiale pour la R\u00e9forme sexuelle sur une base scientifique''.<ref name=\"armand\"/>\n\n====Germany====\n{{unref section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Lily Braun.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Lily Braun]]]]\n\nIn Germany, from 1891 to 1919, the ''Verband Fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine'' (League of Progressive Women's Associations) called for a boycott of marriage and for the enjoyment of sexuality. Founded by [[Lily Braun]] and [[Minna Cauer]], the league also aimed to organise prostitutes into labor unions, taught contraception, and supported the right to abortion and the abolition of criminal penalties against homosexuality, as well as running child-care programs for single mothers. In 1897, teacher and writer [[Emma Trosse]] published a brochure titled ''Ist freie Liebe Sittenlosigkeit?'' (\"Is free love immoral?\").\n\nThe worldwide [[LGBT movements|homosexual emancipation movement]] also began in Germany in the late 19th century, and many of the thinkers whose work inspired sexual liberation in the 20th century were also from the German-speaking world, such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Gross]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Max Stirner]]'s follower and biographer, [[John Henry Mackay]].\n\n====USSR====\nAfter the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration. Kollontai was also a champion of free love. However, [[Clara Zetkin]] recorded that Lenin opposed free love as \"completely un-Marxist, and moreover, anti-social\".<ref>Zetkin, Clara, 1934, ''Lenin on the Woman Question,'' New York: International, p.7. Published in ''Reminiscences of Lenin.''<br>A more extensive quote from Lenin follows: \"It seems to me that this superabundance of sex theories ... springs from the desire to justify one's own abnormal or excessive sex life before bourgeois morality and to plead for tolerance towards oneself. This veiled respect for bourgeois morality is as repugnant to me as rooting about in all that bears on sex. No matter how rebellious and revolutionary it may be made to appear, it is in the final analysis thoroughly bourgeois. It is, mainly, a hobby of the intellectuals and of the sections nearest to them. There is no place for it in the party, in the class-conscious, fighting proletariat.\"</ref> Zetkin also recounted Lenin's denunciation of plans to organise Hamburg's women prostitutes into a \"special revolutionary militant section\": he saw this as \"corrupt and degenerate.\"\n\nDespite the traditional marital lives of Lenin and most Bolsheviks, they believed that sexual relations were outside the jurisdiction of the state. The Soviet government abolished centuries-old Czarist regulations on personal life, which had prohibited homosexuality and made it difficult for women to obtain divorce permits or to live singly. However, by the end of the 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] had taken over the Communist Party and begun to implement socially conservative policies. Homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, and free love was further demonized.\n\n===Recent===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1960s, the bohemian free-love tradition of Greenwich Village in America was carried on by the [[beat generation]], although differing with their predecessors by being an apparently male-dominated movement. The Beats also produced the first appearance of male homosexual champions of free love in the U.S., with writers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Like some of those before, the beats challenged a range of social conventions, and they found inspiration in such aspects of black culture as [[jazz]] music. The Beat movement led on the West Coast to the activities of such groups as the [[Merry Pranksters]] (led, according to [[Grateful Dead]] historian Dennis McNally, not by novelist [[Ken Kesey]], but by hipster and driver [[Neal Cassady]]) and the entire San Francisco pop music scene, in which the implications of sexual bohemianism were advanced in a variety of ways by the [[hippies]].  The study of [[sexology]] continued to gain prominence throughout the era, with the work of researchers [[Alfred Kinsey]] and [[Masters and Johnson]] supporting challenges to traditional values regarding sex and marriage.\n\nWith the [[Summer of Love]] in 1967, the eccentricities of this group became a nationally recognized movement.  Despite the developing [[sexual revolution]] and the influence of the Beatniks had in this new [[counterculture]] social rebellion, it has been acknowledged that the [[New Left]] movement was arguably the most prominent advocate of free love during the late 1960s.<ref name=goldstein>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/e_freelove.html Emma Goldman:People & Events: Free Love] PBS.org, Accessed 26 April 2014</ref>  Many among the counterculture youth sided with New Left arguments that marriage was a symbol of the traditional capitalist culture which supported war.<ref name=goldstein />  \"[[Make Love Not War]],\" a slogan of antiquity renewed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono among others, became a popular slogan in the counterculture movement which denounced both war and capitalism.<ref name=goldstein />  Images from the pro-socialist [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 uprising]] in France, which occurred as the anti-war protests were escalating throughout the United States, would provide a significant source of morale to the New Left cause as well.<ref name=goldstein />\n\nCanadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]'s Dec 20 1967 statement \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\" was a very public declaration justifying his government's decriminalization of sexual activity between same sex partners in Canada, following 1967's [[Summer of Love]].<ref name=\"CBC Player 1969\">{{cite web |title='There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation' |website=CBC Player |date=1967-12-20 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1811727781 | access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Second wave feminism]] continued to question traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] teaching on sexuality, while groups like [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Christian right]] opposed change, after ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' greatly increased access to [[abortion]] in the United States.\n\nAfter the [[Stonewall riots]], [[gay rights]] became an increasingly prominent issue, but by the early 21st century gay activists had shifted their focus to [[same-sex marriage]] rather than free love.

According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s (or persons at or above the [[age of consent]]) are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure without social or legal restraints. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.<ref>[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004631/http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 |date=14 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to today's stereotype, earlier middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world.

Rather, it has argued that sexual relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.\n\nThe term \"sex radical\" is also used interchangeably with the term \"free lover\", and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of \"free love\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forced sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\">Passet, Joanne E.

Access to [[birth control]] was considered a means to women's independence, and leading birth-control activists also embraced free love. Sexual radicals remained focused on their attempts to uphold a woman's right to control her body and to freely discuss issues such as [[contraception]], marital-sex abuse (emotional and physical), and [[sexual education]]. These people believed that by talking about female sexuality, they would help empower women. To help achieve this goal, such radical thinkers relied on the written word, books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and by these means the movement was sustained for over fifty years, spreading the message of free love all over the United States.<ref>Passet, Joanne E.

Women had an uncommon equality and autonomy, even as religious leaders. The Cathars and similar groups (the [[Waldenses]], Apostle brothers, [[Beghards]] and [[Beguines]], [[Lollards]], and [[Hussites]]) were branded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the Roman Catholic Church and suppressed.

A group of [[Political radicalism|radical]] intellectuals in England (sometimes known as the English [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]), who supported the [[French Revolution]] developed early ideas about [[feminism]] and free love.\n\nNotable among them was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[William Blake]], who explicitly compared the sexual oppression of marriage to [[slavery]] in works such as ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' (1793). Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of [[chastity]] as a virtue.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake Poetry Foundation's bio of William Blake]</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E.

Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n{{poemquote|\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n}}\n\nBlake believed that humans were \"fallen\", and that a major impediment to a free love society was corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> He also seems to have thought that marriage should afford the joy of love, but that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy.\n\n[[File:Vindication1b.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Title page reads \"A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICUTRES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS.

PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII.\"|Title page from ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], an early feminist and proponent of free love.]]\nAnother member of Blake's circle was the pioneering English feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband and early anarchist, [[William Godwin]]. The ideals of free love found their champion in one of the earliest [[feminism|feminists]]. In her writings, Wollstonecraft challenged the institution of marriage, and advocated its abolition. Her novels criticized the social construction of marriage and its effects on women. In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' written in 1788, the heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons. She finds love in relationships with another man and a woman. The novel, ''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'', never finished but published in 1798, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an asylum by her husband; Maria finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate. Mary makes it clear that \"women had strong [[sexual desire]]s and that it was degrading and immoral to pretend otherwise.\"<ref name=\"historyguide1\"/>\n\nWollstonecraft felt that women should not give up freedom and control of their sexuality, and thus didn't marry her partner, [[Gilbert Imlay]], despite the two conceiving and having a child together in the midst of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] of the French Revolution. Though the relationship ended badly, due in part to the discovery of Imlay's infidelity, and not least because Imlay abandoned her for good, Wollstonecraft's belief in free love survived. She later developed a relationship with Godwin, who shared her free love ideals, and published on the subject throughout his life. However, the two did decide to marry, just days before her death due to complications at [[childbirth|parturition]].\n\nIn an act understood to support free love, their child, [[Mary Shelley|Mary]], took up with the then still-married English romantic poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] at a young age. Shelley wrote in defence of free love (and vegetarianism) in the prose notes of ''[[Queen Mab]]'' (1813), in his essay ''On Love'' (c. 1815). and in the poem ''[[Epipsychidion]]'' (1821):\n\n{{poemquote|I never was attached to that great sect,\nWhose doctrine is, that each one should select\nOut of the crowd a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion ...\n\nTrue love has this, different from gold and clay,\nThat to divide is not to take away.}}\n\n===Utopian socialism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSharing the free-love ideals of the earlier social movements\u2014as well as their feminism, pacifism, and simple communal life\u2014were the [[utopian socialist]] communities of early-nineteenth-century France and Britain, associated with writers and thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]] in France, and [[Robert Owen]] in England. Fourier, who coined the term ''feminism,'' argued that true freedom could only occur without masters, without the ethos of work, and without suppressing passions: the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.\n\n[[Robert Owen]] argued that marriage formed one of an \"awful trinity\" of oppressors to mankind, as well as [[religion]] and private property, and his son [[Robert Dale Owen|Robert Dale]] was a leading proponent of free divorce. The Saint-Simonian feminist [[Pauline Roland]] took a free-love stance against marriage, having four children in the 1830s, all of whom bore her name.\n\nThe German composer [[Richard Wagner]] advocated something like free love in several of his works, and began a family with [[Cosima Liszt]], then still married to the conductor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]]. Though apparently scandalous at the time, such liaisons seemed the actions of admired artists who were following the dictates of their own wills, rather than those of social convention, and in this way they were in step with their era's liberal philosophers of the cult of passion, such as Fourier, and their actual or eventual openness can be understood to be a prelude to the freer ways of the twentieth century. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke occasionally in favor of something like free love, but when he proposed marriage to that famous practitioner of it, [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], she berated him for being inconsistent with his philosophy of the free and supramoral Superman, a criticism that Nietzsche seems to have taken seriously, or to have at least been stung by. The relationship between composer [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and writer [[George Sand]] can be understood as exemplifying free love in a number of ways. Behavior of this kind by figures in the public eye did much to erode the credibility of conventionalism in relationships, especially when such conventionalism brought actual unhappiness to its practitioners.\n\n===Origins of the movement===\nThe eminent sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] argued in his ''Principles of Sociology'' for the implementation of free divorce. Claiming that marriage consists of two components, \"union by law\" and \"union by affection\", he argued that with the loss of the latter union, legal union should lose all meaning and dissolve automatically, without the legal requirement for a divorce.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmpMZ7K2L3YC|title=\"A Revolution in Christian Morals\": Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15.

Postcard of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] from 1907.]]\nFree love began to coalesce into a movement in the mid to late 19th century. The term was coined by the Christian socialist writer [[John Humphrey Noyes]], although he preferred to use the term '[[Group marriage|complex marriage]]'. Noyes founded the [[Oneida Community]] in 1848, a utopian community that \"[rejected] conventional marriage both as a form of legalism from which Christians should be free and as a selfish institution in which men exerted rights of ownership over women\". He found scriptural justification: \"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven\" (Matt. 22:30).<ref>William Blake before him had made the same connection: \"In Eternity they neither marry nor are given in marriage.\" ([[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion]], 30.15; E176)</ref> Noyes also supported [[eugenics]]; and only certain people (including Noyes himself) were allowed to become parents. Another movement was established in [[Berlin Heights, Ohio]].\n\nIn 1852, a writer named Marx Edgeworth Lazarus published a tract entitled \"Love vs. Marriage pt. 1,\" in which he portrayed marriage as \"incompatible with social harmony and the root cause of mental and physical impairments.\"  Lazarus intertwined his writings with his religious teachings, a factor that made the Christian community more tolerable to the free love idea.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\"/> Elements of the free-love movement also had links to [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movements, drawing parallels between slavery and \"[[sexual slavery]]\" (marriage), and forming alliances with black activists.\n\nAmerican feminist [[Victoria Woodhull]] (1838\u20131927), the first woman to run for presidency in the U.S. in 1872, was also called \"the high priestess of free love\". In 1871, Woodhull wrote: \"Yes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere\".<ref>[http://gos.sbc.edu/w/woodhull.html \"And the Truth Shall Make You Free\"] (20 November 1871)</ref>\n\n[[File:Victoria Woodhull caricature by Thomas Nast 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] portraying [[Victoria Woodhull]] as an advocate of free love]]\n\nThe women's movement, free love and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] were three strongly linked movements at the time, and Woodhull was also a spiritualist leader.

[[Moses Harman]]) and the German-language Detroit newspaper ''Der Arme Teufel'' (ed. Robert Reitzel). Organisations included the New England Free Love League, founded with the assistance of American libertarian [[Benjamin Tucker]] as a spin-off from the New England Labor Reform League (NELRL). A minority of [[freethought|freethinkers]] also supported free love.<ref>Kirkley, Evelyn A. 2000. ''Rational Mothers and Infidel Gentlemen: Gender and American Atheism, 1865\u20131915.''

The first volume consisted of twenty writers, of which only one was a woman.<ref name=\"Spurlock, John 1994\"/>\n\nSex radicals were not alone in their fight against marriage ideals. Some other nineteenth-century Americans saw this social institution as flawed, but hesitated to abolish it. Groups such as the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Latter-day Saints were wary of the social notion of marriage. These organizations and sex radicals believed that true equality would never exist between the sexes as long as the church and the state continued to work together, worsening the problem of subordination of wives to their husbands.<ref name=\"Passet, Joanne E 2003\"/>\n\nFree-love movements continued into the early 20th century in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circles in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. A group of Villagers lived free-love ideals and promoted them in the political journal ''[[The Masses]]'' and its sister publication ''[[The Little Review]],'' a literary journal. Incorporating influences from the writings of the English thinkers and activists [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis]], women such as [[Emma Goldman]] campaigned for a range of sexual freedoms, including homosexuality and access to contraception. Other notable figures among the Greenwich-Village scene who have been associated with free love include [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Max Eastman]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Floyd Dell]], [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]], [[Ida Rauh]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[Neith Boyce]]; a certain extreme was reached by self-proclaimed Satanist [[Anton LaVey]]. [[Dorothy Day]] also wrote passionately in defense of free love, women's rights, and contraception\u2014but later, after converting to Catholicism, she criticized the sexual revolution of the sixties.\n\nThe development of the idea of free love in the United States was also significantly impacted by the publisher of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine, [[Hugh Hefner]], whose activities and persona over more than a half century popularized the idea of free love to the general public.{{clear}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Havelock Ellis]] was a pioneer [[sexology|sexologist]] and advocate of free love.]]\nFree love was a central tenet of the philosophy of the [[Fellowship of the New Life]], founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]].<ref>{{cite web|first=James A.|last=Good|url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/TD.html|title=The Development of Thomas Davidson's Religious and Social Thought}}</ref> Fellowship members included many illustrious intellectuals of the day, who went on to radically challenge accepted Victorian notions of morality and sexuality, including poets [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]], animal rights activist [[Henry Stephens Salt]],<ref>George Hendrick, ''Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters'', University of Illinois Press, pg. 47 (1977).</ref> sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], feminists [[Edith Ellis|Edith Lees]], [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and [[Annie Besant]] and writers [[H.

He became interested in progressive education, especially providing information to young people on the topic of sexual education. For Carpenter, sexual education meant forwarding a clear analysis of the ways in which sex and gender were used to oppress women, contained in Carpenter's radical work ''Love's Coming-of-Age''. In it he argued that a just and equal society must promote the sexual and [[economic freedom]] of women. The main crux of his analysis centred on the negative effects of the institution of marriage. He regarded marriage in England as both enforced celibacy and a form of prostitution.\n\n[[File:Carpenter1875.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Edward Carpenter]] in 1875.]]\nHe did not believe women would truly be free until a socialist society was established.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In contrast to many of his contemporaries, however, this led him to conclude that all oppressed workers should support women's emancipation, rather than to subordinate women's rights to male worker's rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He remarked, \"... there is no solution except the freedom of woman - which means, of course, the freedom of the masses of the people, men and women, and the ceasing altogether of economic slavery. There is no solution which will not include the redemption of the terms free women and free love to their true and rightful significance. Let every woman whose heart bleeds for the sufferings of her sex, hasten to declare herself and to constitute herself, as far as she possibly can, a free woman.\"\n\nThe best-known British advocate of free love was the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], later Third Earl Russell, who said that he did not believe he really knew a woman until he had made love with her. Russell consistently addressed aspects of free love throughout his voluminous writings, and was not personally content with conventional [[Monogamy]] until extreme old age. His most famous work on the subject was  ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'', published in 1929. The book heavily criticizes the [[Victorian morality|Victorian notions of morality]] regarding sex and marriage. Russell argued that the laws and ideas about sex of his time were a potpourri from various sources, which were no longer valid with the advent of [[contraception]], as the sexual acts are now separated from the conception. He argued that family is most important for the welfare of children, and as such, a man and a woman should be considered bound only after her first pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787544,00.html \"Sex Seer\"], in ''Time'', 4 November 1929</ref>\n\n\n''Marriage and Morals'' prompted vigorous protests and denunciations against Russell shortly after the book's publication.<ref name=SexEdPioneers>{{cite web|title=Pioneers of Sex Education |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |author=Haeberle, Erwin J. |year=1983 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313020717/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |archivedate=13 March 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> A decade later, the book cost him his professorial appointment at the [[City College of New York]] due to a court judgment that his opinions made him \"morally unfit\" to teach.<ref name=Denied>{{cite web|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell |author=Leberstein, Stephen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |publisher=Academe |date=November\u2013December 2001 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004082928/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |archivedate=4 October 2008 }}</ref> Contrary to what many people believed, Russell did not advocate an extreme [[libertine]] position. Instead, he felt that sex, although a natural impulse like hunger or thirst, involves more than that, because no one is \"satisfied by the bare sexual act\". He argued that abstinence enhances the pleasure of sex, which is better when it \"has a large psychical element than when it is purely physical\".<ref name=\"Hauerwas\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEKu6SoJR6cC|title=After Christendom?: How the Church Is to Behave If Freedom, Justice, and a Christian Nation Are Bad Ideas|author=Stanley Hauerwas|year=2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426722011}}</ref>\n\nRussell noted that for a marriage to work requires that there \"be a feeling of complete equality on both sides; there must be no interference with mutual freedom; there must be the most complete physical and mental intimacy; and there must be a certain similarity in regard to standards of value\".

The English-born anarchist, [[Chummy Fleming]] founded the [[Melbourne Anarchist Club]] in 1886, which led a debate on the topic of free love, and a couple of years later released an anonymous pamphlet on the subject:  'Free Love\u2014Explained and Defended' (possibly written by [[David Andrade]] or [[Chummy Fleming]]). The view of the Anarchist Club was formed in part as a reaction to the infamous [[Whitechapel murders]] by the notorious [[Jack the Ripper]]; his atrocities were at the time popularly understood by some\u2014at least, by anarchists\u2014to be a violation of the freedom of certain extreme classes of \"working women,\" but by extension of all women.\n\n[[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] libertarian [[Alice Winspear]], the wife of pioneer socialist [[William Robert Winspear]], wrote: \"Let us have freedom\u2014freedom for both man and woman\u2014freedom to earn our bread in whatever vocation is best suited to us, and freedom to love where we like, and to live only with those whom we love, and by whom we are loved in return.\" A couple of decades later, the [[Melbourne]] anarchist [[List of feminist poets|feminist poet]] [[Lesbia Harford]] also championed free love.\n\n====France====\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[\u00c9mile Armand]]]]\nIn the bohemian districts of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]], many were determined to shock the \"[[bourgeois]]\" sensibilities of the society they grew up in; many, such as the anarchist [[Beno\u00eet Broutchoux]], favored free love. At the same time, the [[cross-dressing]] radical activist [[Madeleine Pelletier]] practised celibacy, distributed birth-control devices and information, and performed abortions.\n\nAn important propagandist of free love was [[individualist anarchist]] [[\u00c9mile Armand]]. He advocated [[naturism]] and [[polyamory]] in what he termed ''la camaraderie amoureuse''.<ref name=\"armand\">[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf \"Emile Armand and la camaraderie amourouse \u2013 Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy.\" by Francis Rousin] Retrieved 10 June 2010</ref> He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject such as \"De la libert\u00e9 sexuelle\" (1907) where he advocated not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called \"plural love\".<ref name=\"armand\"/> In the individualist anarchist journal ''L'en dehors'' he and others continued in this way. Armand seized this opportunity to outline his theses supporting revolutionary sexualism and camaraderie amoureuse that differed from the traditional views of the partisans of free love in several respects.\n\nLater Armand submitted that from an individualist perspective nothing was reprehensible about making \"love\", even if one did not have very strong feelings for one's partner.<ref name=\"armand\"/> \"The camaraderie amoureuse thesis\", he explained, \"entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.\"<ref name=\"armand\"/> He also published ''Le Combat contre la jalousie et le sexualisme r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (1926), followed over the years by ''Ce que nous entendons par libert\u00e9 de l'amour'' (1928), ''La Camaraderie amoureuse ou \"chiennerie sexuelle\"'' (1930), and, finally, ''La R\u00e9volution sexuelle et la camaraderie amoureuse'' (1934), a book of nearly 350 pages comprising most of his writings on sexuality.<ref name=\"armand\"/> In a text from 1937, he mentioned among the individualist objectives the practice of forming [[voluntary association]]s for purely sexual purposes of heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual nature or of a combination thereof.\n\nHe also supported the right of individuals to change sex and stated his willingness to rehabilitate forbidden pleasures, non-conformist caresses (he was personally inclined toward voyeurism), as well as sodomy. This led him to allocate more and more space to what he called \"the sexual non-conformists\", while excluding physical violence.<ref name=\"armand\"/> His militancy also included translating texts from people such as [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] and establishments of free love associations which tried to put into practice ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' through actual sexual experiences.\n\nFree love advocacy groups active during this time included the ''Association d'\u00c9tudes sexologiques'' and the ''Ligue mondiale pour la R\u00e9forme sexuelle sur une base scientifique''.<ref name=\"armand\"/>\n\n====Germany====\n{{unref section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Lily Braun.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Lily Braun]]]]\n\nIn Germany, from 1891 to 1919, the ''Verband Fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine'' (League of Progressive Women's Associations) called for a boycott of marriage and for the enjoyment of sexuality. Founded by [[Lily Braun]] and [[Minna Cauer]], the league also aimed to organise prostitutes into labor unions, taught contraception, and supported the right to abortion and the abolition of criminal penalties against homosexuality, as well as running child-care programs for single mothers. In 1897, teacher and writer [[Emma Trosse]] published a brochure titled ''Ist freie Liebe Sittenlosigkeit?'' (\"Is free love immoral?\").\n\nThe worldwide [[LGBT movements|homosexual emancipation movement]] also began in Germany in the late 19th century, and many of the thinkers whose work inspired sexual liberation in the 20th century were also from the German-speaking world, such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Gross]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Max Stirner]]'s follower and biographer, [[John Henry Mackay]].\n\n====USSR====\nAfter the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration. Kollontai was also a champion of free love. However, [[Clara Zetkin]] recorded that Lenin opposed free love as \"completely un-Marxist, and moreover, anti-social\".<ref>Zetkin, Clara, 1934, ''Lenin on the Woman Question,'' New York: International, p.7. Published in ''Reminiscences of Lenin.''<br>A more extensive quote from Lenin follows: \"It seems to me that this superabundance of sex theories ... springs from the desire to justify one's own abnormal or excessive sex life before bourgeois morality and to plead for tolerance towards oneself. This veiled respect for bourgeois morality is as repugnant to me as rooting about in all that bears on sex. No matter how rebellious and revolutionary it may be made to appear, it is in the final analysis thoroughly bourgeois. It is, mainly, a hobby of the intellectuals and of the sections nearest to them. There is no place for it in the party, in the class-conscious, fighting proletariat.\"</ref> Zetkin also recounted Lenin's denunciation of plans to organise Hamburg's women prostitutes into a \"special revolutionary militant section\": he saw this as \"corrupt and degenerate.\"\n\nDespite the traditional marital lives of Lenin and most Bolsheviks, they believed that sexual relations were outside the jurisdiction of the state. The Soviet government abolished centuries-old Czarist regulations on personal life, which had prohibited homosexuality and made it difficult for women to obtain divorce permits or to live singly. However, by the end of the 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] had taken over the Communist Party and begun to implement socially conservative policies. Homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, and free love was further demonized.\n\n===Recent===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1960s, the bohemian free-love tradition of Greenwich Village in America was carried on by the [[beat generation]], although differing with their predecessors by being an apparently male-dominated movement. The Beats also produced the first appearance of male homosexual champions of free love in the U.S., with writers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Like some of those before, the beats challenged a range of social conventions, and they found inspiration in such aspects of black culture as [[jazz]] music. The Beat movement led on the West Coast to the activities of such groups as the [[Merry Pranksters]] (led, according to [[Grateful Dead]] historian Dennis McNally, not by novelist [[Ken Kesey]], but by hipster and driver [[Neal Cassady]]) and the entire San Francisco pop music scene, in which the implications of sexual bohemianism were advanced in a variety of ways by the [[hippies]].  The study of [[sexology]] continued to gain prominence throughout the era, with the work of researchers [[Alfred Kinsey]] and [[Masters and Johnson]] supporting challenges to traditional values regarding sex and marriage.\n\nWith the [[Summer of Love]] in 1967, the eccentricities of this group became a nationally recognized movement.  Despite the developing [[sexual revolution]] and the influence of the Beatniks had in this new [[counterculture]] social rebellion, it has been acknowledged that the [[New Left]] movement was arguably the most prominent advocate of free love during the late 1960s.<ref name=goldstein>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/e_freelove.html Emma Goldman:People & Events: Free Love] PBS.org, Accessed 26 April 2014</ref>  Many among the counterculture youth sided with New Left arguments that marriage was a symbol of the traditional capitalist culture which supported war.<ref name=goldstein />  \"[[Make Love Not War]],\" a slogan of antiquity renewed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono among others, became a popular slogan in the counterculture movement which denounced both war and capitalism.<ref name=goldstein />  Images from the pro-socialist [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 uprising]] in France, which occurred as the anti-war protests were escalating throughout the United States, would provide a significant source of morale to the New Left cause as well.<ref name=goldstein />\n\nCanadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]'s Dec 20 1967 statement \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\" was a very public declaration justifying his government's decriminalization of sexual activity between same sex partners in Canada, following 1967's [[Summer of Love]].<ref name=\"CBC Player 1969\">{{cite web |title='There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation' |website=CBC Player |date=1967-12-20 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1811727781 | access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Second wave feminism]] continued to question traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] teaching on sexuality, while groups like [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Christian right]] opposed change, after ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' greatly increased access to [[abortion]] in the United States.\n\nAfter the [[Stonewall riots]], [[gay rights]] became an increasingly prominent issue, but by the early 21st century gay activists had shifted their focus to [[same-sex marriage]] rather than free love. [[Divorce]] and [[blended families]] became more common, and young couples increasingly [[cohabitation|chose to live together]] in [[common law marriage]]s or [[domestic partnership]]s rather than marrying in church or formalizing or legalizing marriage through the court system.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n* [[Anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]\n* [[Common-law marriage]]\n* [[Don Juanism]]\n* [[Flower power]]\n* [[Fornication]]\n* [[Free union]]\n* [[New Woman]]\n* [[Open marriage]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Polyamory]]\n* [[Sex-positive movement]]\n* [[Sexual norm]]\n* [[Sexual objectification]]\n* [[Sexual revolution]]\n* [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]]\n* [[Unconditional love]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/polder.pdf \"The recurring movements of free love\" by Saskia Poldervaart]\n*Victoria Woodhull, ''Free Lover: Sex, Marriage And Eugenics in the Early Speeches of Victoria Woodhull'' (Seattle: Inkling, 2005) {{ISBN|1-58742-050-3}}\n*Stoehr, Taylor, ed.
