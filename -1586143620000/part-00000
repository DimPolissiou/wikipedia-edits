It has long been pursued by [[West Japan Railway Company]] (JR West) and [[Nankai Railway]] in order to connect the [[Yamatoji Line]] ([[Kansai Main Line]]) and [[Nankai Main Line]] with [[Shin-Osaka Station]], greatly enhancing both companies' connections to [[Kansai Airport]] and [[Wakayama Prefecture]]. As of 2017, construction is expected to begin within the next few years and last until spring 2031. [[Hankyu Railway]] has also announced tentative plans to build a new underground line connecting the Naniwasuji Line to [[Juso Station|Juso]] and possibly a Shin-Osaka Station of its own.\n\n== Background ==\nWhile both JR and Nankai operate trains to Wakayama (via the [[Hanwa Line]] and the [[Nankai Main Line]], respectively) and to Kansai Airport (both via the [[Kansai Airport Line]]), neither route is ideal. For JR, trains must use the [[Osaka Loop Line]] past [[Tennoji Station]], both creating and being affected by delays on that line, and bypassing [[JR Namba Station]], the company's closest link to Osaka's commercial center. Additionally, express trains to Shin-Osaka and [[Kyoto Station|Kyoto]] must use the Umeda Freight Line, bypassing [[Osaka Station]] entirely. For Nankai, all trains go direct to its terminal in Namba, precluding links to points further north.\n\nThe issue surrounding Osaka Station for JR is set to be alleviated in fiscal 2022 with the opening of the first section (incorporated into the [[Osaka Higashi Line]] project, although construction delays have pushed its opening back 4 years compared to the rest of Phase II), which will terminate at new underground platforms of Osaka Station on a route replacing the aboveground Umeda Freight Line. Without constructing an entirely new line through central Osaka, however, the other problems remain.\n\nPlans were drawn up in the mid-2000s to alleviate the problems for both companies through the construction of a new underground line, primarily under the north-south thoroughfare Naniwa-suji (hence the name), branching at its south end to connect both the Yamatoji Line (Kansai Main Line) terminal at JR Namba, and a Nankai line, with Shin-Osaka via a new underground route through what was then the Umeda Freight Terminal. The Umeda portion of this plan was eventually incorporated into Phase II of the Osaka Higashi Line, with provisions in place for eventual construction of the Naniwasuji Line itself. Early plans for Nankai called for moving the [[Shiomibashi Line]] (the northern end of the [[K\u014dya Line]]) underground and connecting to the Naniwasuji Line via [[Shiomibashi Station]] (thus upgrading and increasing traffic on an otherwise lightly traveled, local route), but the company ultimately rejected this routing in favor of one via a new underground station at Namba.\n\n== Current Plans ==\nCurrent plans are to begin construction once the Osaka Higashi Line opens to Osaka Station, with completion anticipated in spring 2031. Total construction costs, including provisions for the line at Kita-Umeda, are projected to total some 330 billion yen. In the interim, JR passenger trains will use a single-track freight spur from Osaka Station to join the Osaka Loop Line at [[Nishi-Kujo Station|Nishi-Kuj\u014d]], much as they do now.\n\n== Stations ==\nExcluding the northern terminus at the new underground platforms of [[Osaka Station]] (opening in 2023 for the Osaka Higashi Line) and the existing [[JR Namba Station|JR Namba]], three stations (all names tentative) are to be constructed: [[Nakanoshima Station (Osaka)|Nakanoshima]] (in the vicinity of the [[Keihan Electric Railway|Keihan]] station), [[Nishi-Hommachi Station|Nishi-Hommachi]] (likely near Chuo-Odori and Utsubo Park), and [[Nankai Shin-Namba Station|Nankai Shin-Namba]] (underground in the vicinity of Nankai Namba, potentially underneath the \"Carnival Mall\" approach to the Namba Parks shopping mall). The line will also pass through the vicinity of [[Fukushima Station (Osaka)|Fukushima]] (Osaka Loop Line, [[Hanshin Main Line]]), [[Shin-Fukushima Station|Shin-Fukushima]] ([[JR Tozai Line]]) and [[Nishi\u014dhashi Station|Nishi\u014dhashi]] ([[Osaka Metro]] [[Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line]]), although no stations are currently planned for these locations.\n\n[[Category:Passenger rail transport]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Japan]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\nThe {{nihongo|'''Naniwasuji Line'''|\u306a\u306b\u308f\u7b4b\u7dda|Naniwasuji-sen}} is the tentative name for a planned underground [[heavy rail]] line, which will run north-south through [[Osaka City]], primarily under the avenue Naniwa-suji.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism.

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Sketch by [[Jan Matejko]], 1860]]\nSignificant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta, as defined by Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax, a 1425 guarantee against the 'arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property' of its members, a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial [[Sejm]]s, and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners.<ref name=\"ian\" />\n\n=== Real and false nobles ===\nNobles were born into a [[noble family]], adopted by a noble family (this was abolished in 1633), or achieved noble rank through [[Ennoblement]] by a king or [[Sejm]] for reasons such as bravery in combat, services to the state, etc. Yet this proved to be the rarest means of gaining noble status. Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary. The author shows it is likely a Ciechanowiecki ancestor either received a fashionable noble title in exchange for money while travelling on ''the Grand Tour'' in Western Europe or, simply \"conferred it upon himself\" to hark back to a former higher status. [retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

It was deliberately enacted with the aim of ruining the szlachta. Only in the [[Russian Partition]] did peasants pay the market price for land redemption, the average for the rest of the [[Russian Empire]] was 34% above the market rates. All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

With the introduction of rulers and rules, big game, generically ''zwierzyna'': [[Aurochs]], [[European bison|bison]], deer and boar became the preserve of kings and princes on penalty of [[Poaching|poacher]]s' death. From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

One was the [[Polish Hunting Dog]], the ''brach''. The other was the [[Ogar Polski]]. [[Count Xavier Branicki]] was so nostalgic about Polish hunting, that when he settled in France in the mid 19th century, and restored his estate at the [[Chateau de Montresor]], he ordered a brace of Ogar Polski hounds from the Polish breeder and ''szlachcic'', Piotr Orda.<ref>{{cite web|language=pl|title=Historia Ogara Polskiego|url=http://klubogarapolskiego.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=71|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316072343/http://klubogarapolskiego.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=71|archive-date=2017-03-16|url-status=dead|df=}} retrieved 2015-11-24.</ref>\n\n== Demographics and stratification ==\nThe szlachta differed in many respects from the nobility in other countries. The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for [[absolute monarchy]], in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the [[political system]] to evolve into an [[oligarchy]].\n\nSzlachta members were also proportionately more numerous than their equivalents in all other European countries, constituting 6\u201312% of the entire population.<ref name=\"Frost\" />{{Ref label|a|a|none}} By contrast, nobles in other European countries, except for Spain, amounted to a mere 1\u20133%.

Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility.

But where there has been an intrusion of a dominant people, or settlers, who have not fused into the original population, there we find an exact counterpart of Polish society: the dominant settlers establishing themselves as an upper caste, all politically equal among themselves, and holding the lands (or, more frequently, simply drawing the rents) of the country.<ref name=\"races-old-world\" />{{rp|483}}}}\n\nSociologist and historian, [[Jerzy Szacki|Jerzy Ryszard Szacki]] said in this context,\n\n{{quote|text=... the Polish nobility was a closed group (apart from a few exceptions, many of which were contrary to the law), in which membership was inherited.<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" />}}\nOthers assert the szlachta were not a [[social class]], but a [[caste]], among them, historian [[Adam Zamoyski]],\n\n{{quote|text=A more apt analogy might perhaps be made with the [[Rajput]]s of northern India. ... unlike any other gentry in Europe, the szlachta was not limited by nor did it depend for its status on either wealth, or land, or royal writ.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. The remaining 15% were made up of a substantial minority of Jews.<ref>Kuklo C.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

Farms belonging to kmiecie were largely self-sufficient, although some of them were, to varying extents, engaged in production for the market. Other, less numerous, sections of the peasantry were the zagrodnicy (Latin: ortulani), or smallholders, and the ogrodnicy, or cottagers, who farmed small plots of land. These two categories of peasants were not able to support themselves and their families from their land, so they earned extra money as hired labourers on their landlords\u2019 land, or that of the kmiecie. Apart from the holders of large or small farms, Polish villages were also inhabited by so-called komornicy, landless lodgers who earned wages locally.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates). Socially they were not a distinct class from the rycerstwo from which they all originated<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\">{{cite book\n | last = Dmowski\n | first = Roman Stanis\u0142aw\n | authorlink = Roman Dmowski\n | editor-last = Duff\n | editor-first = James Duff\n | editor-link = James Duff Duff\n | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/RussianRealitiesAndProblems\n | title = RUSSIAN REALITIES & PROBLEMS\n | year = 1917\n | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n | location = Cambridge, East of England, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM\n | page = 94\n | chapter = Poland, Old And New\n | quote = But between the gentry and the magnates there was only a difference of wealth and culture.

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence. These mo\u017cni (Magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority.<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|75, 76}} In [[Gallus Anonymus|Gall Anonym's]] chronicle, there is noted the nobility's alarm when the [[Count palatine|Palatine]] [[Sieciech]] \"elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born\" entrusting them with state offices. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=149}}\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Lithuanian nobility}}\n[[File:Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II)]]]]\nIn [[Lithuania Propria]] and in [[Samogitia]], prior to the creation of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] by [[Mindaugas]], nobles were called ''die beste leuten'' in [[German language|German]] sources. In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected. Major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility occurred after various sanctions were imposed by the [[Russian Empire]], such as removing ''Lithuania'' from the names of the ''Gubernyas'' shortly after the [[November Uprising]].<ref name=\"Ochma\u0144ski\">{{cite book |last=Ochma\u0144ski |first=Jerzy |title=The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation |publisher=Mickiewicz University |year=1986 |location=Pozna\u0144}}</ref> After the [[January Uprising]] the sanctions went further, and Russian officials announced that \"Lithuanians were actually Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism\" and began to intensify [[Lithuanian press ban#Origins and legal basis|russification]], and to [[Lithuanian press ban|ban]] the printing of books in Lithuanian.\n\n==== Ruthenia ====\n{{Main|Ruthenian nobility}}\nAfter the principalities of [[Halych]] and [[Volhynia]] became integrated with the Grand Duchy, [[Ruthenia]]'s nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural [[melting pot]] that was the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

[retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

Since then their legitimacy and fate depended on the legislation and policies of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility. The szlachta was not rigidly exclusive or closed as a class, but according to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th and mid-18th century, is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of about two ennoblements per year, or 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.\n\nAccording to two English journalists [[Richard Holt Hutton]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] writing on the subject in 1864,\n\n{{quote|text=The condition of the country at the present day shows that the population consisted of two different peoples, between whom there was an impassable barrier.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]].

It was changed to a [[homophone]] meaning ''empty hand'' (\u7a7a\u624b) in 1935. The original use of the word \"karate\" in print is attributed to [[Ank\u014d Itosu]]; he wrote it as \"\u5510\u624b\". The Tang Dynasty of China ended in AD 907, but the kanji representing it remains in use in [[Japanese language]] referring to [[China]] generally, in such words as \"\u5510\u4eba\u8857\" meaning [[Chinatown]]. Thus the word \"karate\" was originally a way of expressing  \"martial art from China.\"\n\n{{quote|Since there are no written records it is not known definitely whether the ''kara'' in karate was originally written with the character \u5510 meaning China or the character \u7a7a meaning empty. During the time when admiration for China and things Chinese was at its height in the Ry\u016bky\u016bs it was the custom to use the former character when referring to things of fine quality. Influenced by this practice, in recent times karate has begun to be written with the character \u5510 to give it a sense of class or elegance.|Gichin Funakoshi<ref>{{cite book |title=Karate-do Nyumon |last=Funakoshi |first=Gishin |authorlink= |year=1988 |publisher= |location=Japan |isbn=4-7700-1891-6 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rH3gPz21FWkC&pg=PA24&q |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nThe first documented use of a [[homophone]] of the [[logogram]] pronounced ''kara'' by replacing the [[Chinese character]] meaning \"Tang Dynasty\"  with the character meaning \"empty\"  took place in ''Karate Kumite'' written in August 1905 by [[Ch\u014dmo Hanashiro]] (1869\u20131945). [[Sino-Japanese relations]] have never been very good, and especially at the time of the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], referring to the Chinese origins of karate was considered [[politically incorrect]].<ref name=\"paltz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newpaltzkarate.com/article/Article1SA.html |title=What's In A Name? |publisher=Newpaltzkarate.com |accessdate=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210012035/http://newpaltzkarate.com/article/Article1SA.html |archivedate=10 December 2004 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|In 1933, the Okinawan art of karate was recognized as a Japanese martial art by the Japanese Martial Arts Committee known as the \"Butoku Kai\". Until 1935, \"karate\" was written as  \"\u5510\u624b\" (Chinese hand). But in 1935, the masters of the various styles of Okinawan karate conferred to decide a new name for their art. They decided to call their art \"karate\"  written in Japanese characters as \"\u7a7a\u624b\" (empty hand).<ref name=\"Higaonna 1985 19\"/>}}\n\nAnother nominal development is the addition of ''d\u014d'' (\u9053:\u3069\u3046) to the end of the word karate. ''D\u014d'' is a suffix having numerous meanings including road, path, route, and way. It is used in many martial arts that survived Japan's [[Meiji period|transition]] from [[Edo period|feudal culture]] to [[Economy of Japan|modern times]]. It implies that these arts are not just fighting systems but contain spiritual elements when promoted as disciplines. In this context ''d\u014d'' is usually translated as \"the way of ___\". Examples include [[aikido]], [[judo]], [[kyudo]], and [[kendo]]. Thus karated\u014d is more than just empty hand techniques. It is \"The Way of the Empty Hand\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Okinawa===\n{{See also|Okinawan martial arts}}\nKarate began as a common fighting system known as [[T\u014dde|''te'']] ([[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ti) among the [[Pechin]] class of the [[Ryukyuans]]. After trade relationships were established with the [[Ming dynasty]] of China in 1372 by King [[Satto]] of [[Ch\u016bzan]], some forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] were introduced to the [[Ryukyu Islands]] by the visitors from China, particularly [[Fujian]] Province. A large group of Chinese families moved to Okinawa around 1392 for the purpose of cultural exchange, where they established the community of [[Kumemura]] and shared their knowledge of a wide variety of Chinese arts and sciences, including the Chinese martial arts. The political centralization of Okinawa by King [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] in 1429 and the policy of banning weapons by King [[Sh\u014d Shin]] in 1477, later enforced in Okinawa after the [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invasion]] by the [[Shimazu clan]] in 1609, are also factors that furthered the development of unarmed combat techniques in Okinawa.<ref name=\"okinawa history\"/>\n\nThere were few formal styles of ''te,'' but rather many practitioners with their own methods. One surviving example is the [[Motobu-ry\u016b]] school passed down from the Motobu family by Seikichi Uehara.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |page = 154 }} Motobu-ry\u016b & Seikichi Uehara</ref> Early styles of karate are often generalized as [[Shuri-te]], [[Naha-te]], and [[Tomari-te]], named after the three cities from which they emerged.<ref name=\"Higaonna 1985 19\">{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 1 Fundamental Techniques |year = 1985 |isbn =0-87040-595-0 |page = 19 }}</ref> Each area and its teachers had particular kata, techniques, and principles that distinguished their local version of ''te'' from the others.\n\nMembers of the Okinawan upper classes were sent to China regularly to study various political and practical disciplines. The incorporation of empty-handed [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] [[Kung Fu]] into Okinawan martial arts occurred partly because of these exchanges and partly because of growing legal restrictions on the use of weaponry. Traditional karate ''kata'' bear a strong resemblance to the forms found in Fujian martial arts such as [[Fujian White Crane]], [[Five Ancestors]], and Gangrou-quan ([[Hard and soft (martial arts)|Hard Soft]] Fist; pronounced \"G\u014dj\u016bken\" in Japanese).<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |page = 28 }} For example Ch\u014djun Miyagi adapted Rokkushu of White Crane into Tensh\u014d</ref> Many Okinawan weapons such as the [[sai (weapon)|sai]], [[tonfa]], and [[nunchaku]] may have originated in and around Southeast Asia.\n\n[[Kanga Sakukawa|Sakukawa Kanga]] (1782\u20131838) had studied [[Boxing|pugilism]] and [[Gun (staff)|staff]] (''bo'') fighting in China (according to one legend, under the guidance of Kosokun, originator of [[K\u016bsank\u016b (kata)|''kusanku kata'']]). In 1806 he started teaching a fighting art in the city of [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] that he called \"Tudi Sakukawa,\" which meant \"Sakukawa of China Hand.\" This was the first known recorded reference to the art of \"Tudi,\" written as \u5510\u624b. Around the 1820s Sakukawa's most significant student [[Matsumura S\u014dkon]] (1809\u20131899) taught a synthesis of ''te'' (Shuri-te and Tomari-te) and [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin]] (Chinese \u5c11\u6797) styles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Matsumura's style would later become the [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]] style.\n\n[[File:Itosu Anko.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ank\u014d Itosu]], grandfather of modern karate]]\n\nMatsumura taught his art to [[Ank\u014d Itosu|Itosu Ank\u014d]] (1831\u20131915) among others.

The forms he created are common across nearly all styles of karate.

In addition many Okinawans were actively teaching, and are thus also responsible for the development of karate on the main islands. Funakoshi was a student of both [[Ank\u014d Asato|Asato Ank\u014d]] and [[Ank\u014d Itosu|Itosu Ank\u014d]] (who had worked to introduce karate to the Okinawa Prefectural School System in 1902).

This was a turbulent period in the history of the region. It includes Japan's annexation of the Okinawan island group in 1872, the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), the [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexation of Korea]], and the rise of [[Japanese expansionism|Japanese militarism]] (1905\u20131945).\n\nJapan was [[Second Sino-Japanese War#Invasion of China|invading China]] at the time, and Funakoshi knew that the art of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang/China]] hand would not be accepted; thus the change of the art's name to \"way of the empty hand.\" The ''d\u014d'' suffix implies that ''karated\u014d'' is a path to self-knowledge, not just a study of the technical aspects of fighting. Like most martial arts practiced in Japan, karate made its transition from -''jutsu'' to -''d\u014d'' around the beginning of the 20th century. The \"''d\u014d''\" in \"karate-d\u014d\" sets it apart from karate-''jutsu'', as [[aikido]] is distinguished from [[aikijutsu]], [[judo]] from [[jujutsu]], [[kendo]] from [[kenjutsu]] and [[iaido]] from [[iaijutsu]].\n\n[[File:Funakoshi Gichin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gichin Funakoshi]], founder of [[Shotokan Karate]]]]\n\nFunakoshi changed the names of many kata and the name of the art itself (at least on mainland Japan), doing so to get karate accepted by the Japanese [[bud\u014d]] organization [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]. Funakoshi also gave Japanese names to many of the kata. The five ''pinan'' forms became known as ''heian'', the three ''naihanchi'' forms became known as ''tekki'', ''seisan'' as ''hangetsu'', ''Chint\u014d'' as ''gankaku'', ''wanshu'' as ''enpi'', and so on. These were mostly political changes, rather than changes to the content of the forms, although Funakoshi did introduce some such changes. Funakoshi had trained in two of the popular branches of Okinawan karate of the time, Shorin-ry\u016b and Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b. In Japan he was influenced by kendo, incorporating some ideas about [[distancing]] and timing into his style. He always referred to what he taught as simply karate, but in 1936 he built a dojo in Tokyo and the style he left behind is usually called [[Shotokan]] after this dojo. ''Shoto'', meaning \"pine wave\", was Funakoshi's pen name and ''kan'' meaning \"hall\".\n\nThe modernization and systemization of karate in Japan also included the adoption of the white uniform that consisted of the [[kimono]] and the ''[[dogi]]'' or ''[[keikogi]]''\u2014mostly called just [[karategi]]\u2014and colored belt ranks. Both of these innovations were originated and popularized by [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of judo and one of the men Funakoshi consulted in his efforts to modernize karate.\n\nA new form of karate called [[Kyokushin]] was formally founded in 1957 by [[Masutatsu Oyama]] (who was born a Korean, Choi Yeong-Eui \ucd5c\uc601\uc758). Kyokushin is largely a synthesis of Shotokan and G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. It teaches a curriculum that emphasizes [[Aliveness (martial arts)|aliveness]], physical toughness, and [[Full-contact|full contact]] sparring. Because of its emphasis on physical, full-force [[sparring]], Kyokushin is now often called \"[[full contact karate]]\", or \"[[Knockdown karate]]\" (after the name for its competition rules). Many other karate organizations and styles are descended from the Kyokushin curriculum.\n\n==Practice==\n{{See also|Okinawan kobud\u014d|Japanese martial arts#Philosophical and strategic concepts}}\nKarate can be practiced as an art ([[bud\u014d]]), [[self defense]] or as a [[combat sport]]. Traditional karate places emphasis on self-development (bud\u014d).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itkf.org/tk.html |title=International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) |accessdate=23 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204111922/http://www.itkf.org/tk.html |archivedate=4 December 2010 }}</ref> Modern Japanese style training emphasizes the psychological elements incorporated into a proper ''kokoro'' (attitude) such as perseverance, fearlessness, virtue, and leadership skills. Sport karate places emphasis on exercise and competition. Weapons are an important training activity in some styles of karate.\n\nKarate training is commonly divided into ''[[kihon]]'' (basics or fundamentals), ''[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' (forms), and ''[[kumite]]'' (sparring).\n\n===Kihon===\n{{Main|Kihon}}\nKihon means basics and these form the base for everything else in the style including stances, strikes, punches, kicks and blocks. Karate styles place varying importance on kihon. Typically this is training in unison of a technique or a combination of techniques by a group of karateka. Kihon may also be prearranged drills in smaller groups or in pairs.\n\n===Kata===\n{{Main|Karate kata}}\n[[File:Motobu Choki2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Motobu Ch\u014dki]] in Naihanchi-dachi, one of the basic karate stances]]\nKata ([[wikt:\u578b|\u578b]]:\u304b\u305f) means literally \"shape\" or \"model.\" Kata is a formalized sequence of movements which represent various offensive and defensive postures. These postures are based on idealized combat applications. The applications when applied in a demonstration with real opponents is referred to as a [[Bunkai]]. The Bunkai shows how every stance and movement is used. Bunkai is a useful tool to understand a kata.\n\nTo attain a formal rank the karateka must demonstrate competent performance of specific required kata for that level. The Japanese terminology for grades or ranks is commonly used. Requirements for examinations vary among schools.\n\n===Kumite===\n{{Main|Kumite}}\n[[Sparring]] in Karate is called kumite (\u7d44\u624b:\u304f\u307f\u3066). It literally means \"meeting of hands.\" Kumite is practiced both as a sport and as self-defense training.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sensei Elan & Sensei Randy.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Karateka]] executing a [[Flying kick|flying side kick]]]] -->\n\nLevels of physical contact during sparring vary considerably. [[Full contact karate]] has several variants. Knockdown karate (such as [[Kyokushin]]) uses full power techniques to bring an opponent to the ground. In [[kickboxing]] variants (for example [[K-1]]), the preferred win is by knockout. Sparring in armour, ''[[bogu kumite]]'', allows full power techniques with some safety. Sport kumite in many international competition under the [[World Karate Federation]] is free or structured with [[light contact]] or [[semi contact]] and points are awarded by a referee.\n\nIn structured kumite (''yakusoku'', prearranged), two participants perform a choreographed series of techniques with one striking while the other blocks. The form ends with one devastating technique (''hito tsuki'').\n\nIn free sparring (Jiyu Kumite), the two participants have a free choice of scoring techniques. The allowed techniques and contact level are primarily determined by sport or style organization policy, but might be modified according to the age, rank and sex of the participants. Depending upon style, [[takedown (grappling)|take-downs]], [[Sweep (martial arts)|sweeps]] and in some rare cases even time-limited [[grappling]] on the ground are also allowed.\n\nFree sparring is performed in a marked or closed area. The bout runs for a fixed time (2 to 3 minutes.) The time can run continuously (''iri kume'') or be stopped for referee judgment. In [[light contact]] or [[semi contact]] kumite, points are awarded based on the criteria: good form, sporting attitude, vigorous application, awareness/''[[zanshin]]'', good timing and correct distance.\nIn full contact karate kumite, points are based on the results of the impact, rather than the formal appearance of the scoring technique.\n\n===Dojo Kun===\n{{Main|Dojo kun}}\nIn the [[bushid\u014d]] tradition ''dojo kun'' is a set of guidelines for karateka to follow. These guidelines apply both in the ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) and in everyday life.\n\n===Conditioning===\nOkinawan karate uses supplementary training known as ''[[hojo undo]]''. This utilizes simple equipment made of wood and stone. The ''[[makiwara]]'' is a striking post. The ''[[Hojo undo#Nigiri game|nigiri game]]'' is a large jar used for developing grip strength. These supplementary exercises are designed to increase [[Physical strength|strength]], [[Endurance|stamina]], [[speed]], and [[Motor coordination|muscle coordination]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 1 Fundamental Techniques |year = 1985 |isbn =0-87040-595-0 |page = 67 }}</ref> Sport Karate emphasizes [[aerobic exercise]], [[anaerobic exercise]], [[Power (physics)|power]], [[Sport agility|agility]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[stress management]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Mitchell |first = David |title = Winning Karate Competition |year = 1991 |isbn =0-7136-3402-2 |page = 25 }}</ref> All practices vary depending upon the school and the teacher.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Nihongo|Gichin Funakoshi|\u8239\u8d8a \u7fa9\u73cd}} said, \"There are no contests in karate.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Shigeru |first = Egami |title = The Heart of Karatedo |year = 1976 |isbn =0-87011-816-1 |page = 111}}</ref> In pre\u2013World War II Okinawa, kumite was not part of karate training.<ref>{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 4 Applications of the Kata |year = 1990 |isbn =978-0870408489 |page = 136 }}</ref> [[Shigeru Egami]] relates that, in 1940, some karateka were ousted from their ''dojo'' because they adopted sparring after having learned it in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite book |last = Shigeru |first = Egami |title = The Heart of Karatedo |year = 1976 |isbn =0-87011-816-1 |page = 113 }}</ref>\n\nKarate is divided into style organizations.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d9IDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=sport+karate#v=onepage |title=Black Belt |page=62 |date= May 1982|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref> These organizations sometimes cooperate in non-style specific sport karate organizations or federations.

Other Okinawan teachers also adopted this practice. In the [[Ky\u016b]]/[[dan rank|Dan]] system the beginner grades start with a higher numbered ky\u016b (''e.g.'', 10th Ky\u016b or Juky\u016b) and progress toward a lower numbered ky\u016b. The Dan progression continues from 1st Dan (Shodan, or 'beginning dan') to the higher dan grades. Ky\u016b-grade karateka are referred to as \"color belt\" or mudansha (\"ones without dan/rank\"). Dan-grade karateka are referred to as ''yudansha'' (holders of dan/rank). Yudansha typically wear a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. Normally, the first five to six dans are given by examination by superior dan holders, while the subsequent (7 and up) are honorary, given for special merits and/or age reached.\nRequirements of rank differ among styles, organizations, and schools. Ky\u016b ranks stress [[Karate stances|stance]], [[Equilibrioception|balance]], and [[motor coordination|coordination]]. Speed and power are added at higher grades.\n\nMinimum age and time in rank are factors affecting promotion. Testing consists of demonstration of techniques before a panel of examiners. This will vary by school, but testing may include everything learned at that point, or just new information. The demonstration is an application for new rank (shinsa) and may include [[kata]], [[bunkai]], self-defense, routines, [[tameshiwari]] (breaking), and kumite (sparring).\n\n==Philosophy==\nIn ''Karate-Do Kyohan,'' Funakoshi quoted from the [[Heart Sutra]], which is prominent in [[Shingon]] Buddhism: \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form itself\" (''shiki zokuze k\u016b k\u016b zokuze shiki'').<ref>Funakoshi, Gichin. \"Karate-d\u014d Kyohan \u2013 The Master Text\" Tokyo. Kodansha International; 1973. Page 4</ref>\nHe interpreted the \"kara\" of Karate-d\u014d to mean \"to purge oneself of selfish and evil thoughts ... for only with a clear mind and conscience can the practitioner understand the knowledge which he receives.\"  Funakoshi believed that one should be \"inwardly humble and outwardly gentle.\" Only by behaving humbly can one be open to Karate's many lessons. This is done by listening and being receptive to criticism. He considered courtesy of prime importance. He said that \"Karate is properly applied only in those rare situations in which one really must either down another or be downed by him.\" Funakoshi did not consider it unusual for a devotee to use Karate in a real physical confrontation no more than perhaps once in a lifetime. He stated that Karate practitioners must \"never be easily drawn into a fight.\" It is understood that one blow from a real expert could mean death. It is clear that those who misuse what they have learned bring dishonor upon themselves. He promoted the character trait of personal conviction. In \"time of grave public crisis, one must have the courage&nbsp;... to face a million and one opponents.\"  He taught that indecisiveness is a weakness.<ref>Funakoshi, Gichin. \"Karate-d\u014d Kyohan \u2013 The Master Text\" Tokyo.

[[Masaru Shintani]], at the age of 13, began to study Shorin-Ryu karate in the Japanese camp under Kitigawa. In 1956 after 9 years of training with Kitigawa, Shintani travelled to Japan and met [[Hironori Otsuka]] ([[Wado Ryu]]).

In 1966 he began (with Otsuka's endorsement) the Shintani Wado Kai Karate Federation. During the 1970s Otsuka appointed Shintani the Supreme Instructor of Wado Kai in North America. In 1979, Otsuka publicly promoted Shintani to hachidan (8th dan) and privately gave him a kudan certificate (9th dan), which was revealed by Shintani in 1995. Shintani and Otsuka visited each other in Japan and Canada several times, the last time in 1980 two years prior to Otsuka's death. Shintani died 7 May 2000.<ref name=\"JAMA\"/>\n\n===Europe===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, several Japanese karate masters began to teach the art in Europe, but it was not until 1965 that the Japan Karate Association (JKA) sent to Europe four well-trained young Karate instructors [[Taiji Kase]], [[Keinosuke Enoeda]], [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] and [[Hiroshi Shirai]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Kase went to France, Enoeada to England and Shirai in Italy. These Masters maintained always a strong link between them, the JKA and the others JKA masters in the world, especially [[Hidetaka Nishiyama]] in the US\n\n===France===\nFrance Shotokan Karate was created in 1964 by Tsutomu Ohshima. It is affiliated with another of his organizations, Shotokan Karate of America (SKA). However, in 1965 [[Taiji Kase]] came from Japan along with Enoeda and Shirai, who went to England and Italy respectively, and karate came under the influence of the JKA.\n\n===Italy===\n[[Hiroshi Shirai]], one of the original instructors sent by the JKA to Europe along with Kase, Enoeda and Kanazawa, moved to Italy in 1965 and quickly established a Shotokan enclave that spawned several instructors who in their turn soon spread the style all over the country. By 1970 Shotokan karate was the most spread martial art in Italy apart from [[Judo]]. Other styles such as [[Wado Ryu]], [[Goju Ryu]] and [[Shito Ryu]], are present and well established in Italy, while  [[Shotokan]] remains the most popular.\n\n===Korea===\n{{See also|Korea under Japanese rule}}\nDue to past conflict between Korea and Japan, most notably during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the early 20th century, the influence of karate in Korea is a contentious issue.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/TaiwanProgramme/Journal/JournalContents/TCP6OrrandAmae.pdf|title=Karate in Taiwan and South Korea: A Tale of Two Postcolonial Societies|last1=Orr|first1=Monty|last2=Amae|first2=Yoshihisa|journal=Taiwan in Comparative Perspective|volume=6|date=December 2016|pages=1\u201316|issn=1752-7732|publisher=Taiwan Research Programme, London School of Economics}}</ref> From 1910 until 1945, Korea was annexed by the Japanese Empire. It was during this time that many of the Korean martial arts masters of the 20th century were exposed to Japanese karate. After regaining independence from Japan, many Korean martial arts schools that opened up in the 1940s and 1950s were founded by masters who had trained in karate in Japan as part of their martial arts training.\n\n[[Won Kuk Lee]], a Korean student of Funakoshi, founded the first martial arts school after the Japanese occupation of Korea ended in 1945, called the [[Chung Do Kwan]]. Having studied under [[Gichin Funakoshi]] at [[Chuo University]], Lee had incorporated [[taekkyon]], [[kung fu]], and karate in the martial art that he taught which he called \"[[Tang Soo Do]]\", the Korean transliteration of the Chinese characters for \"Way of Chinese Hand\" (\u5510\u624b\u9053).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tangsudo.com/index.php/en/academy |title=Academy |publisher=Tangsudo.com |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210193918/http://www.tangsudo.com/index.php/en/academy |archivedate=10 December 2014 }}</ref> In the mid-1950s, the martial arts schools were unified under President [[Rhee Syngman]]'s order, and became [[taekwondo]] under the leadership of [[Choi Hong Hi]] and a committee of Korean masters. Choi, a significant figure in taekwondo history, had also studied karate under Funakoshi. Karate also provided an important comparative model for the early founders of taekwondo in the formalization of their art including [[Hyeong|hyung]] and the [[taekwondo#Ranks, belts, and promotion|belt ranking]] system. The original taekwondo ''hyung'' were identical to karate ''[[kata]]''. Eventually, original Korean forms were developed by individual schools and associations. Although the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] and [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] are the most prominent among Korean martial arts organizations, ''tang soo do'' schools that teach Japanese karate still exist as they were originally conveyed to Won Kuk Lee and his contemporaries from Funakoshi.\n\n===Soviet Union===\nKarate appeared in the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, during [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s policy of improved international relations.

Yoseikan had been founded by [[Minoru Mochizuki]], a master of multiple Japanese martial arts, who had studied Karate with [[Gichin Funakoshi]], thus the Yoseikan style was heavily influenced by Shotokan.<ref name=\"UK History\" /> Bell began teaching in the tennis courts of his parents' back garden in Ilford, Essex and his group was to become the British Karate Federation. On 19 July 1957, Vietnamese Hoang Nam 3rd Dan, billed as \"Karate champion of Indo China\", was invited to teach by Bell at Maybush Road, but the first instructor from Japan was [[Tetsuji Murakami]] (1927\u20131987) a 3rd Dan Yoseikan under Minoru Mochizuki and 1st Dan of the JKA, who arrived in England in July 1959.<ref name=\"UK History\" /> In 1959 Frederick Gille set up the Liverpool branch of the British Karate Federation, which was officially recognised in 1961. The Liverpool branch was based at Harold House Jewish Boys Club in Chatham Street before relocating to the YMCA in Everton where it became known as the Red Triangle. One of the early members of this branch was [[Andy Sherry]] who had previously studied Jujutsu with Jack Britten. In 1961 Edward Ainsworth, another blackbelt Judoka, set up the first Karate study group in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland having attended Bell's third 'Karate Summer School' in 1961.<ref name=\"UK History\" />\n\nOutside of Bell's organisation, Charles Mack traveled to Japan and studied under [[Masatoshi Nakayama]] of the [[Japan Karate Association]] who graded Mack to 1st Dan Shotokan on 4 March 1962 in Japan.<ref name=\"UK History\" /> [[Shotokai]] Karate was introduced to England in 1963 by another of [[Gichin Funakoshi]]'s students, [[Mitsusuke Harada]].<ref name=\"UK History\" /> Outside of the Shotokan stable of karate styles, [[Wado Ryu]] Karate was also an early adopted style in the UK, introduced by [[Tatsuo Suzuki (martial artist)|Tatsuo Suzuki]], a 6th Dan at the time in 1964.\n\nDespite the early adoption of Shotokan in the UK, it was not until 1964 that JKA Shotokan officially came to the UK. Bell had been corresponding with the JKA in Tokyo asking for his grades to be ratified in Shotokan having apparently learnt that Murakami was not a designated representative of the JKA. The JKA obliged, and without enforcing a grading on Bell, ratified his black belt on 5 February 1964, though he had to relinquish his Yoseikan grade. Bell requested a visitation from JKA instructors and the next year [[Taiji Kase]], [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]], [[Keinosuke Enoeda]] and [[Hiroshi Shirai]] gave the first JKA demo at [[Kensington Town Hall, London|Kensington Town Hall]] on 21 April 1965. [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] and [[Keinosuke Enoeda]] stayed and Murakami left (later re-emerging as a 5th Dan Shotokai under Harada).<ref name=\"UK History\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bushinkai.org.uk/page47.htm |title=Exclusive: UK Karate History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223124026/http://www.bushinkai.org.uk/page47.htm |archivedate=23 February 2014 |publisher=Bushinkai}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, members of the former British Karate Federation established the [[Karate Union of Great Britain]] (KUGB) under [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] as chief instructor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.karate-iask.com/page_08.htm |title=International Association of Shotokan Karate (IASK) |publisher=Karate-iask.com |accessdate=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529123123/http://www.karate-iask.com/page_08.htm |archive-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and affiliated to JKA. [[Keinosuke Enoeda]] came to England at the same time as Kanazawa, teaching at a ''dojo'' in [[Liverpool]]. Kanazawa left the UK after 3 years and Enoeda took over. After Enoeda's death in 2003, the KUGB elected Andy Sherry as Chief Instructor. Shortly after this, a new association split off from KUGB, [[JKA England]].\nAn earlier significant split from the KUGB took place in 1991 when a group led by KUGB senior instructor Steve Cattle formed the English Shotokan Academy (ESA). The aim of this group was to follow the teachings of [[Taiji Kase]], formerly the JKA chief instructor in Europe, who along with Hiroshi Shirai created the World Shotokan Karate-do Academy (WKSA), in 1989 in order to pursue the teaching of \"Budo\" karate as opposed to what he viewed as \"sport karate\". Kase sought to return the practice of Shotokan Karate to its martial roots, reintroducing amongst other things open hand and throwing techniques that had been side lined as the result of competition rules introduced by the JKA. Both the ESA and the WKSA (renamed the Kase-Ha Shotokan-Ryu Karate-do Academy (KSKA) after Kase's death in 2004) continue following this path today.\nIn 1975 Great Britain became the first team ever to take the World male team title from Japan after being defeated the previous year in the final.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Karate in the United States}}\nAfter World War II, members of the [[United States military]] learned karate in Okinawa or Japan and then opened schools in the US.

Dometrich]], [[Ed Parker]], [[Cecil T. Patterson]], [[Gordon Doversola]], [[Donald Hugh Nagle]], [[George Mattson (martial artist)|George Mattson]] and [[Peter Urban (karate)|Peter Urban]] all began instructing in the US.\n\n[[Tsutomu Ohshima]] began studying karate under Shotokan's founder, Gichin Funakoshi, while a student at Waseda University, beginning in 1948. In 1957 Ohshima received his godan (fifth degree black belt), the highest rank awarded by Funakoshi. He founded the first university karate club in the United States at [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1957. In 1959 he founded the Southern California Karate Association (SCKA) which was renamed [[Shotokan Karate of America]] (SKA) in 1969.\n\nIn the 1960s, Anthony Mirakian, [[Richard Kim (karate)|Richard Kim]], [[Teruyuki Okazaki]], [[John Pachivas]], [[Allen Steen]], Gosei Yamaguchi (son of [[G\u014dgen Yamaguchi]]), [[Michael G.

He founded the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). [[Takayuki Mikami]] was sent to New Orleans by the JKA in 1963.\n\nIn 1964, [[Takayuki Kubota]] relocated the International Karate Association from Tokyo to California.\n\n==In film and popular culture==\nKarate spread rapidly in the West through popular culture. In 1950s popular fiction, karate was at times described to readers in near-mythical terms, and it was credible to show Western experts of unarmed combat as unaware of Eastern martial arts of this kind.<ref>For example, [[Ian Fleming]]'s book ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959, p.91\u201395) describes the protagonist [[James Bond]], an expert in unarmed combat, as utterly ignorant of Karate and its demonstrations, and describes the Korean '[[Oddjob]]' in these terms: ''Goldfinger said, \"Have you ever heard of Karate? No? Well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in Karate. Karate is a branch of judo, but it is to judo what a [[Maschinengewehr 08|spandau]] is to a [[catapult]]...\".'' Such a description in a popular novel assumed and relied upon Karate being almost unknown in the West.</ref> By the 1970s, [[martial arts film]]s had formed a mainstream genre that propelled karate and other Asian martial arts into mass popularity.<ref name=\"karate UFC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/sports/23karate.html|title=Contender Shores Up Karate's Reputation Among U.F.C.

It was changed to a [[homophone]] meaning ''empty hand'' (\u7a7a\u624b) in 1935. The original use of the word \"karate\" in print is attributed to [[Ank\u014d Itosu]]; he wrote it as \"\u5510\u624b\". The Tang Dynasty of China ended in AD 907, but the kanji representing it remains in use in [[Japanese language]] referring to [[China]] generally, in such words as \"\u5510\u4eba\u8857\" meaning [[Chinatown]]. Thus the word \"karate\" was originally a way of expressing  \"martial art from China.\"\n\n{{quote|Since there are no written records it is not known definitely whether the ''kara'' in karate was originally written with the character \u5510 meaning China or the character \u7a7a meaning empty. During the time when admiration for China and things Chinese was at its height in the Ry\u016bky\u016bs it was the custom to use the former character when referring to things of fine quality. Influenced by this practice, in recent times karate has begun to be written with the character \u5510 to give it a sense of class or elegance.|Gichin Funakoshi<ref>{{cite book |title=Karate-do Nyumon |last=Funakoshi |first=Gishin |authorlink= |year=1988 |publisher= |location=Japan |isbn=4-7700-1891-6 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rH3gPz21FWkC&pg=PA24&q |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nThe first documented use of a [[homophone]] of the [[logogram]] pronounced ''kara'' by replacing the [[Chinese character]] meaning \"Tang Dynasty\"  with the character meaning \"empty\"  took place in ''Karate Kumite'' written in August 1905 by [[Ch\u014dmo Hanashiro]] (1869\u20131945).

Until 1935, \"karate\" was written as  \"\u5510\u624b\" (Chinese hand). But in 1935, the masters of the various styles of Okinawan karate conferred to decide a new name for their art. They decided to call their art \"karate\"  written in Japanese characters as \"\u7a7a\u624b\" (empty hand).<ref name=\"Higaonna 1985 19\"/>}}\n\nAnother nominal development is the addition of ''d\u014d'' (\u9053:\u3069\u3046) to the end of the word karate. ''D\u014d'' is a suffix having numerous meanings including road, path, route, and way. It is used in many martial arts that survived Japan's [[Meiji period|transition]] from [[Edo period|feudal culture]] to [[Economy of Japan|modern times]]. It implies that these arts are not just fighting systems but contain spiritual elements when promoted as disciplines. In this context ''d\u014d'' is usually translated as \"the way of ___\". Examples include [[aikido]], [[judo]], [[kyudo]], and [[kendo]]. Thus karated\u014d is more than just empty hand techniques. It is \"The Way of the Empty Hand\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Okinawa===\n{{See also|Okinawan martial arts}}\nKarate began as a common fighting system known as [[T\u014dde|''te'']] ([[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ti) among the [[Pechin]] class of the [[Ryukyuans]]. After trade relationships were established with the [[Ming dynasty]] of China in 1372 by King [[Satto]] of [[Ch\u016bzan]], some forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] were introduced to the [[Ryukyu Islands]] by the visitors from China, particularly [[Fujian]] Province. A large group of Chinese families moved to Okinawa around 1392 for the purpose of cultural exchange, where they established the community of [[Kumemura]] and shared their knowledge of a wide variety of Chinese arts and sciences, including the Chinese martial arts. The political centralization of Okinawa by King [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] in 1429 and the policy of banning weapons by King [[Sh\u014d Shin]] in 1477, later enforced in Okinawa after the [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invasion]] by the [[Shimazu clan]] in 1609, are also factors that furthered the development of unarmed combat techniques in Okinawa.<ref name=\"okinawa history\"/>\n\nThere were few formal styles of ''te,'' but rather many practitioners with their own methods. One surviving example is the [[Motobu-ry\u016b]] school passed down from the Motobu family by Seikichi Uehara.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |page = 154 }} Motobu-ry\u016b & Seikichi Uehara</ref> Early styles of karate are often generalized as [[Shuri-te]], [[Naha-te]], and [[Tomari-te]], named after the three cities from which they emerged.<ref name=\"Higaonna 1985 19\">{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 1 Fundamental Techniques |year = 1985 |isbn =0-87040-595-0 |page = 19 }}</ref> Each area and its teachers had particular kata, techniques, and principles that distinguished their local version of ''te'' from the others.\n\nMembers of the Okinawan upper classes were sent to China regularly to study various political and practical disciplines. The incorporation of empty-handed [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] [[Kung Fu]] into Okinawan martial arts occurred partly because of these exchanges and partly because of growing legal restrictions on the use of weaponry. Traditional karate ''kata'' bear a strong resemblance to the forms found in Fujian martial arts such as [[Fujian White Crane]], [[Five Ancestors]], and Gangrou-quan ([[Hard and soft (martial arts)|Hard Soft]] Fist; pronounced \"G\u014dj\u016bken\" in Japanese).<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |page = 28 }} For example Ch\u014djun Miyagi adapted Rokkushu of White Crane into Tensh\u014d</ref> Many Okinawan weapons such as the [[sai (weapon)|sai]], [[tonfa]], and [[nunchaku]] may have originated in and around Southeast Asia.\n\n[[Kanga Sakukawa|Sakukawa Kanga]] (1782\u20131838) had studied [[Boxing|pugilism]] and [[Gun (staff)|staff]] (''bo'') fighting in China (according to one legend, under the guidance of Kosokun, originator of [[K\u016bsank\u016b (kata)|''kusanku kata'']]).

Around the 1820s Sakukawa's most significant student [[Matsumura S\u014dkon]] (1809\u20131899) taught a synthesis of ''te'' (Shuri-te and Tomari-te) and [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin]] (Chinese \u5c11\u6797) styles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Matsumura's style would later become the [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]] style.\n\n[[File:Itosu Anko.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ank\u014d Itosu]], grandfather of modern karate]]\n\nMatsumura taught his art to [[Ank\u014d Itosu|Itosu Ank\u014d]] (1831\u20131915) among others.

In addition many Okinawans were actively teaching, and are thus also responsible for the development of karate on the main islands. Funakoshi was a student of both [[Ank\u014d Asato|Asato Ank\u014d]] and [[Ank\u014d Itosu|Itosu Ank\u014d]] (who had worked to introduce karate to the Okinawa Prefectural School System in 1902). During this time period, prominent teachers who also influenced the spread of karate in Japan included [[Kenwa Mabuni]], [[Ch\u014djun Miyagi]], [[Motobu Ch\u014dki]], [[Kanken T\u014dyama]], and [[Kanbun Uechi]]. This was a turbulent period in the history of the region. It includes Japan's annexation of the Okinawan island group in 1872, the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), the [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexation of Korea]], and the rise of [[Japanese expansionism|Japanese militarism]] (1905\u20131945).\n\nJapan was [[Second Sino-Japanese War#Invasion of China|invading China]] at the time, and Funakoshi knew that the art of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang/China]] hand would not be accepted; thus the change of the art's name to \"way of the empty hand.\" The ''d\u014d'' suffix implies that ''karated\u014d'' is a path to self-knowledge, not just a study of the technical aspects of fighting. Like most martial arts practiced in Japan, karate made its transition from -''jutsu'' to -''d\u014d'' around the beginning of the 20th century. The \"''d\u014d''\" in \"karate-d\u014d\" sets it apart from karate-''jutsu'', as [[aikido]] is distinguished from [[aikijutsu]], [[judo]] from [[jujutsu]], [[kendo]] from [[kenjutsu]] and [[iaido]] from [[iaijutsu]].\n\n[[File:Funakoshi Gichin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gichin Funakoshi]], founder of [[Shotokan Karate]]]]\n\nFunakoshi changed the names of many kata and the name of the art itself (at least on mainland Japan), doing so to get karate accepted by the Japanese [[bud\u014d]] organization [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]. Funakoshi also gave Japanese names to many of the kata. The five ''pinan'' forms became known as ''heian'', the three ''naihanchi'' forms became known as ''tekki'', ''seisan'' as ''hangetsu'', ''Chint\u014d'' as ''gankaku'', ''wanshu'' as ''enpi'', and so on. These were mostly political changes, rather than changes to the content of the forms, although Funakoshi did introduce some such changes. Funakoshi had trained in two of the popular branches of Okinawan karate of the time, Shorin-ry\u016b and Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b. In Japan he was influenced by kendo, incorporating some ideas about [[distancing]] and timing into his style. He always referred to what he taught as simply karate, but in 1936 he built a dojo in Tokyo and the style he left behind is usually called [[Shotokan]] after this dojo. ''Shoto'', meaning \"pine wave\", was Funakoshi's pen name and ''kan'' meaning \"hall\".\n\nThe modernization and systemization of karate in Japan also included the adoption of the white uniform that consisted of the [[kimono]] and the ''[[dogi]]'' or ''[[keikogi]]''\u2014mostly called just [[karategi]]\u2014and colored belt ranks. Both of these innovations were originated and popularized by [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of judo and one of the men Funakoshi consulted in his efforts to modernize karate.\n\nA new form of karate called [[Kyokushin]] was formally founded in 1957 by [[Masutatsu Oyama]] (who was born a Korean, Choi Yeong-Eui \ucd5c\uc601\uc758). Kyokushin is largely a synthesis of Shotokan and G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. It teaches a curriculum that emphasizes [[Aliveness (martial arts)|aliveness]], physical toughness, and [[Full-contact|full contact]] sparring. Because of its emphasis on physical, full-force [[sparring]], Kyokushin is now often called \"[[full contact karate]]\", or \"[[Knockdown karate]]\" (after the name for its competition rules). Many other karate organizations and styles are descended from the Kyokushin curriculum.\n\n==Practice==\n{{See also|Okinawan kobud\u014d|Japanese martial arts#Philosophical and strategic concepts}}\nKarate can be practiced as an art ([[bud\u014d]]), [[self defense]] or as a [[combat sport]].

Sport karate places emphasis on exercise and competition. Weapons are an important training activity in some styles of karate.\n\nKarate training is commonly divided into ''[[kihon]]'' (basics or fundamentals), ''[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' (forms), and ''[[kumite]]'' (sparring).\n\n===Kihon===\n{{Main|Kihon}}\nKihon means basics and these form the base for everything else in the style including stances, strikes, punches, kicks and blocks. Karate styles place varying importance on kihon. Typically this is training in unison of a technique or a combination of techniques by a group of karateka. Kihon may also be prearranged drills in smaller groups or in pairs.\n\n===Kata===\n{{Main|Karate kata}}\n[[File:Motobu Choki2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Motobu Ch\u014dki]] in Naihanchi-dachi, one of the basic karate stances]]\nKata ([[wikt:\u578b|\u578b]]:\u304b\u305f) means literally \"shape\" or \"model.\" Kata is a formalized sequence of movements which represent various offensive and defensive postures. These postures are based on idealized combat applications. The applications when applied in a demonstration with real opponents is referred to as a [[Bunkai]]. The Bunkai shows how every stance and movement is used. Bunkai is a useful tool to understand a kata.\n\nTo attain a formal rank the karateka must demonstrate competent performance of specific required kata for that level. The Japanese terminology for grades or ranks is commonly used. Requirements for examinations vary among schools.\n\n===Kumite===\n{{Main|Kumite}}\n[[Sparring]] in Karate is called kumite (\u7d44\u624b:\u304f\u307f\u3066). It literally means \"meeting of hands.\" Kumite is practiced both as a sport and as self-defense training.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sensei Elan & Sensei Randy.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Karateka]] executing a [[Flying kick|flying side kick]]]] -->\n\nLevels of physical contact during sparring vary considerably. [[Full contact karate]] has several variants. Knockdown karate (such as [[Kyokushin]]) uses full power techniques to bring an opponent to the ground. In [[kickboxing]] variants (for example [[K-1]]), the preferred win is by knockout. Sparring in armour, ''[[bogu kumite]]'', allows full power techniques with some safety. Sport kumite in many international competition under the [[World Karate Federation]] is free or structured with [[light contact]] or [[semi contact]] and points are awarded by a referee.\n\nIn structured kumite (''yakusoku'', prearranged), two participants perform a choreographed series of techniques with one striking while the other blocks. The form ends with one devastating technique (''hito tsuki'').\n\nIn free sparring (Jiyu Kumite), the two participants have a free choice of scoring techniques. The allowed techniques and contact level are primarily determined by sport or style organization policy, but might be modified according to the age, rank and sex of the participants. Depending upon style, [[takedown (grappling)|take-downs]], [[Sweep (martial arts)|sweeps]] and in some rare cases even time-limited [[grappling]] on the ground are also allowed.\n\nFree sparring is performed in a marked or closed area. The bout runs for a fixed time (2 to 3 minutes.) The time can run continuously (''iri kume'') or be stopped for referee judgment. In [[light contact]] or [[semi contact]] kumite, points are awarded based on the criteria: good form, sporting attitude, vigorous application, awareness/''[[zanshin]]'', good timing and correct distance.\nIn full contact karate kumite, points are based on the results of the impact, rather than the formal appearance of the scoring technique.\n\n===Dojo Kun===\n{{Main|Dojo kun}}\nIn the [[bushid\u014d]] tradition ''dojo kun'' is a set of guidelines for karateka to follow. These guidelines apply both in the ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) and in everyday life.\n\n===Conditioning===\nOkinawan karate uses supplementary training known as ''[[hojo undo]]''. This utilizes simple equipment made of wood and stone. The ''[[makiwara]]'' is a striking post. The ''[[Hojo undo#Nigiri game|nigiri game]]'' is a large jar used for developing grip strength. These supplementary exercises are designed to increase [[Physical strength|strength]], [[Endurance|stamina]], [[speed]], and [[Motor coordination|muscle coordination]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 1 Fundamental Techniques |year = 1985 |isbn =0-87040-595-0 |page = 67 }}</ref> Sport Karate emphasizes [[aerobic exercise]], [[anaerobic exercise]], [[Power (physics)|power]], [[Sport agility|agility]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[stress management]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Mitchell |first = David |title = Winning Karate Competition |year = 1991 |isbn =0-7136-3402-2 |page = 25 }}</ref> All practices vary depending upon the school and the teacher.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Nihongo|Gichin Funakoshi|\u8239\u8d8a \u7fa9\u73cd}} said, \"There are no contests in karate.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Shigeru |first = Egami |title = The Heart of Karatedo |year = 1976 |isbn =0-87011-816-1 |page = 111}}</ref> In pre\u2013World War II Okinawa, kumite was not part of karate training.<ref>{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 4 Applications of the Kata |year = 1990 |isbn =978-0870408489 |page = 136 }}</ref> [[Shigeru Egami]] relates that, in 1940, some karateka were ousted from their ''dojo'' because they adopted sparring after having learned it in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite book |last = Shigeru |first = Egami |title = The Heart of Karatedo |year = 1976 |isbn =0-87011-816-1 |page = 113 }}</ref>\n\nKarate is divided into style organizations.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d9IDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=sport+karate#v=onepage |title=Black Belt |page=62 |date= May 1982|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref> These organizations sometimes cooperate in non-style specific sport karate organizations or federations.

The tournament may be exclusively for members of a particular style (closed) or one in which any martial artist from any style may participate within the rules of the tournament (open).\n\nThe [[World Karate Federation]] (WKF) is the largest sport karate organization and is recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) as being responsible for karate competition in the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_677.pdf |title=Activity Report |date= |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> The WKF has developed common rules governing all styles.

Other Okinawan teachers also adopted this practice. In the [[Ky\u016b]]/[[dan rank|Dan]] system the beginner grades start with a higher numbered ky\u016b (''e.g.'', 10th Ky\u016b or Juky\u016b) and progress toward a lower numbered ky\u016b. The Dan progression continues from 1st Dan (Shodan, or 'beginning dan') to the higher dan grades. Ky\u016b-grade karateka are referred to as \"color belt\" or mudansha (\"ones without dan/rank\"). Dan-grade karateka are referred to as ''yudansha'' (holders of dan/rank). Yudansha typically wear a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. Normally, the first five to six dans are given by examination by superior dan holders, while the subsequent (7 and up) are honorary, given for special merits and/or age reached.\nRequirements of rank differ among styles, organizations, and schools. Ky\u016b ranks stress [[Karate stances|stance]], [[Equilibrioception|balance]], and [[motor coordination|coordination]]. Speed and power are added at higher grades.\n\nMinimum age and time in rank are factors affecting promotion. Testing consists of demonstration of techniques before a panel of examiners. This will vary by school, but testing may include everything learned at that point, or just new information. The demonstration is an application for new rank (shinsa) and may include [[kata]], [[bunkai]], self-defense, routines, [[tameshiwari]] (breaking), and kumite (sparring).\n\n==Philosophy==\nIn ''Karate-Do Kyohan,'' Funakoshi quoted from the [[Heart Sutra]], which is prominent in [[Shingon]] Buddhism: \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form itself\" (''shiki zokuze k\u016b k\u016b zokuze shiki'').<ref>Funakoshi, Gichin. \"Karate-d\u014d Kyohan \u2013 The Master Text\" Tokyo. Kodansha International; 1973. Page 4</ref>\nHe interpreted the \"kara\" of Karate-d\u014d to mean \"to purge oneself of selfish and evil thoughts ... for only with a clear mind and conscience can the practitioner understand the knowledge which he receives.\"  Funakoshi believed that one should be \"inwardly humble and outwardly gentle.\" Only by behaving humbly can one be open to Karate's many lessons. This is done by listening and being receptive to criticism. He considered courtesy of prime importance. He said that \"Karate is properly applied only in those rare situations in which one really must either down another or be downed by him.\" Funakoshi did not consider it unusual for a devotee to use Karate in a real physical confrontation no more than perhaps once in a lifetime. He stated that Karate practitioners must \"never be easily drawn into a fight.\" It is understood that one blow from a real expert could mean death. It is clear that those who misuse what they have learned bring dishonor upon themselves. He promoted the character trait of personal conviction. In \"time of grave public crisis, one must have the courage&nbsp;... to face a million and one opponents.\"  He taught that indecisiveness is a weakness.<ref>Funakoshi, Gichin. \"Karate-d\u014d Kyohan \u2013 The Master Text\" Tokyo.

Karate was practised quietly without a large amount of organization. During the Second World War, many Japanese-Canadian families were moved to the interior of British Columbia. [[Masaru Shintani]], at the age of 13, began to study Shorin-Ryu karate in the Japanese camp under Kitigawa. In 1956 after 9 years of training with Kitigawa, Shintani travelled to Japan and met [[Hironori Otsuka]] ([[Wado Ryu]]). In 1958 Otsuka invited Shintani to join his organization Wado Kai, and in 1969 he asked Shintani to officially call his style Wado.<ref name=\"JAMA\">{{cite journal|title=no title given |last=Robert |first=T. |journal=Journal of Asian Martial Arts |year=2006 |volume=15 |issue=4 |publisher=this issue is not available as a back issue |url=http://journalofasianmartialarts.com/cms2/journal-issues/15.html }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn Canada during this same time, karate was also introduced by [[Masami Tsuruoka]] who had studied in Japan in the 1940s under [[Tsuyoshi Chitose]].<ref name=historica>{{cite web|title=Karate|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/karate/ <!--Bot repaired link-->|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia \u2013 Historica-Dominion|year=2010|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> In 1954 Tsuruoka initiated the first karate competition in Canada and laid the foundation for the [[Karate Canada|National Karate Association]].<ref name=historica/>\n\nIn the late 1950s Shintani moved to Ontario and began teaching karate and judo at the Japanese Cultural Centre in Hamilton. In 1966 he began (with Otsuka's endorsement) the Shintani Wado Kai Karate Federation. During the 1970s Otsuka appointed Shintani the Supreme Instructor of Wado Kai in North America. In 1979, Otsuka publicly promoted Shintani to hachidan (8th dan) and privately gave him a kudan certificate (9th dan), which was revealed by Shintani in 1995. Shintani and Otsuka visited each other in Japan and Canada several times, the last time in 1980 two years prior to Otsuka's death. Shintani died 7 May 2000.<ref name=\"JAMA\"/>\n\n===Europe===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, several Japanese karate masters began to teach the art in Europe, but it was not until 1965 that the Japan Karate Association (JKA) sent to Europe four well-trained young Karate instructors [[Taiji Kase]], [[Keinosuke Enoeda]], [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] and [[Hiroshi Shirai]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Kase went to France, Enoeada to England and Shirai in Italy. These Masters maintained always a strong link between them, the JKA and the others JKA masters in the world, especially [[Hidetaka Nishiyama]] in the US\n\n===France===\nFrance Shotokan Karate was created in 1964 by Tsutomu Ohshima. It is affiliated with another of his organizations, Shotokan Karate of America (SKA). However, in 1965 [[Taiji Kase]] came from Japan along with Enoeda and Shirai, who went to England and Italy respectively, and karate came under the influence of the JKA.\n\n===Italy===\n[[Hiroshi Shirai]], one of the original instructors sent by the JKA to Europe along with Kase, Enoeda and Kanazawa, moved to Italy in 1965 and quickly established a Shotokan enclave that spawned several instructors who in their turn soon spread the style all over the country. By 1970 Shotokan karate was the most spread martial art in Italy apart from [[Judo]]. Other styles such as [[Wado Ryu]], [[Goju Ryu]] and [[Shito Ryu]], are present and well established in Italy, while  [[Shotokan]] remains the most popular.\n\n===Korea===\n{{See also|Korea under Japanese rule}}\nDue to past conflict between Korea and Japan, most notably during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the early 20th century, the influence of karate in Korea is a contentious issue.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/TaiwanProgramme/Journal/JournalContents/TCP6OrrandAmae.pdf|title=Karate in Taiwan and South Korea: A Tale of Two Postcolonial Societies|last1=Orr|first1=Monty|last2=Amae|first2=Yoshihisa|journal=Taiwan in Comparative Perspective|volume=6|date=December 2016|pages=1\u201316|issn=1752-7732|publisher=Taiwan Research Programme, London School of Economics}}</ref> From 1910 until 1945, Korea was annexed by the Japanese Empire. It was during this time that many of the Korean martial arts masters of the 20th century were exposed to Japanese karate. After regaining independence from Japan, many Korean martial arts schools that opened up in the 1940s and 1950s were founded by masters who had trained in karate in Japan as part of their martial arts training.\n\n[[Won Kuk Lee]], a Korean student of Funakoshi, founded the first martial arts school after the Japanese occupation of Korea ended in 1945, called the [[Chung Do Kwan]]. Having studied under [[Gichin Funakoshi]] at [[Chuo University]], Lee had incorporated [[taekkyon]], [[kung fu]], and karate in the martial art that he taught which he called \"[[Tang Soo Do]]\", the Korean transliteration of the Chinese characters for \"Way of Chinese Hand\" (\u5510\u624b\u9053).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tangsudo.com/index.php/en/academy |title=Academy |publisher=Tangsudo.com |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210193918/http://www.tangsudo.com/index.php/en/academy |archivedate=10 December 2014 }}</ref> In the mid-1950s, the martial arts schools were unified under President [[Rhee Syngman]]'s order, and became [[taekwondo]] under the leadership of [[Choi Hong Hi]] and a committee of Korean masters. Choi, a significant figure in taekwondo history, had also studied karate under Funakoshi. Karate also provided an important comparative model for the early founders of taekwondo in the formalization of their art including [[Hyeong|hyung]] and the [[taekwondo#Ranks, belts, and promotion|belt ranking]] system. The original taekwondo ''hyung'' were identical to karate ''[[kata]]''. Eventually, original Korean forms were developed by individual schools and associations. Although the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] and [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] are the most prominent among Korean martial arts organizations, ''tang soo do'' schools that teach Japanese karate still exist as they were originally conveyed to Won Kuk Lee and his contemporaries from Funakoshi.\n\n===Soviet Union===\nKarate appeared in the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, during [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s policy of improved international relations.

On 19 July 1957, Vietnamese Hoang Nam 3rd Dan, billed as \"Karate champion of Indo China\", was invited to teach by Bell at Maybush Road, but the first instructor from Japan was [[Tetsuji Murakami]] (1927\u20131987) a 3rd Dan Yoseikan under Minoru Mochizuki and 1st Dan of the JKA, who arrived in England in July 1959.<ref name=\"UK History\" /> In 1959 Frederick Gille set up the Liverpool branch of the British Karate Federation, which was officially recognised in 1961. The Liverpool branch was based at Harold House Jewish Boys Club in Chatham Street before relocating to the YMCA in Everton where it became known as the Red Triangle. One of the early members of this branch was [[Andy Sherry]] who had previously studied Jujutsu with Jack Britten. In 1961 Edward Ainsworth, another blackbelt Judoka, set up the first Karate study group in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland having attended Bell's third 'Karate Summer School' in 1961.<ref name=\"UK History\" />\n\nOutside of Bell's organisation, Charles Mack traveled to Japan and studied under [[Masatoshi Nakayama]] of the [[Japan Karate Association]] who graded Mack to 1st Dan Shotokan on 4 March 1962 in Japan.<ref name=\"UK History\" /> [[Shotokai]] Karate was introduced to England in 1963 by another of [[Gichin Funakoshi]]'s students, [[Mitsusuke Harada]].<ref name=\"UK History\" /> Outside of the Shotokan stable of karate styles, [[Wado Ryu]] Karate was also an early adopted style in the UK, introduced by [[Tatsuo Suzuki (martial artist)|Tatsuo Suzuki]], a 6th Dan at the time in 1964.\n\nDespite the early adoption of Shotokan in the UK, it was not until 1964 that JKA Shotokan officially came to the UK. Bell had been corresponding with the JKA in Tokyo asking for his grades to be ratified in Shotokan having apparently learnt that Murakami was not a designated representative of the JKA. The JKA obliged, and without enforcing a grading on Bell, ratified his black belt on 5 February 1964, though he had to relinquish his Yoseikan grade. Bell requested a visitation from JKA instructors and the next year [[Taiji Kase]], [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]], [[Keinosuke Enoeda]] and [[Hiroshi Shirai]] gave the first JKA demo at [[Kensington Town Hall, London|Kensington Town Hall]] on 21 April 1965.

After Enoeda's death in 2003, the KUGB elected Andy Sherry as Chief Instructor. Shortly after this, a new association split off from KUGB, [[JKA England]].\nAn earlier significant split from the KUGB took place in 1991 when a group led by KUGB senior instructor Steve Cattle formed the English Shotokan Academy (ESA). The aim of this group was to follow the teachings of [[Taiji Kase]], formerly the JKA chief instructor in Europe, who along with Hiroshi Shirai created the World Shotokan Karate-do Academy (WKSA), in 1989 in order to pursue the teaching of \"Budo\" karate as opposed to what he viewed as \"sport karate\". Kase sought to return the practice of Shotokan Karate to its martial roots, reintroducing amongst other things open hand and throwing techniques that had been side lined as the result of competition rules introduced by the JKA. Both the ESA and the WKSA (renamed the Kase-Ha Shotokan-Ryu Karate-do Academy (KSKA) after Kase's death in 2004) continue following this path today.\nIn 1975 Great Britain became the first team ever to take the World male team title from Japan after being defeated the previous year in the final.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Karate in the United States}}\nAfter World War II, members of the [[United States military]] learned karate in Okinawa or Japan and then opened schools in the US.

In 1950s popular fiction, karate was at times described to readers in near-mythical terms, and it was credible to show Western experts of unarmed combat as unaware of Eastern martial arts of this kind.<ref>For example, [[Ian Fleming]]'s book ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959, p.91\u201395) describes the protagonist [[James Bond]], an expert in unarmed combat, as utterly ignorant of Karate and its demonstrations, and describes the Korean '[[Oddjob]]' in these terms: ''Goldfinger said, \"Have you ever heard of Karate? No? Well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in Karate. Karate is a branch of judo, but it is to judo what a [[Maschinengewehr 08|spandau]] is to a [[catapult]]...\".'' Such a description in a popular novel assumed and relied upon Karate being almost unknown in the West.</ref> By the 1970s, [[martial arts film]]s had formed a mainstream genre that propelled karate and other Asian martial arts into mass popularity.<ref name=\"karate UFC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/sports/23karate.html|title=Contender Shores Up Karate's Reputation Among U.F.C.

The census enumerated the population of the four original provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario). Manitoba and British Columbia, which had also joined Confederation, were surveyed separately. For the first time, questions on religion and birthplace were asked in the census.\n\nThe 1871 Census was the first to use the de jure method of enumeration rather than the de facto method used in Europe both then and now. The de facto method enumerates people where they are found on Census Day. The de jure method enumerates people according to their usual place of residence.\n\n\u2022 '''1881''' \u2013 All census enumerators were required to take an oath of secrecy\u2014a pledge still required today. The census was extended to include British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island.\n\n\u2022 '''1891''' \u2013 The population was prepared for the census enumerator\u2019s visit through announcements in newspapers and from pulpits.\n\n\u2022 '''1896''' \u2013 A mid-decade census was held in Manitoba beginning in 1896 and then in Saskatchewan and Alberta beginning in 1906. These censuses were needed to measure the rapid growth taking place in the West.\n\n\u2022 '''1901''' \u2013 Census content was expanded to include citizenship and period of immigration.\n\n\u2022 '''1905''' \u2013 The census office became a permanent bureau of the federal government.\n\n\u2022 '''1906''' \u2013 Beginning in 1906, the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan began to take separate censuses of population and agriculture every five years to monitor the growth of the West.\n\n\u2022 '''1912''' \u2013 Responsibility for conducting the census was transferred from the former Ministry of Agriculture to the former Ministry of Trade and Commerce.\n\n\u2022 '''1918''' \u2013 The Dominion Bureau of Statistics was created.\n\n\u2022 '''1931''' \u2013 Even though compilation and tabulation for the 1931 Census were still carried out with mechanical equipment, a new sorter-tabulator developed by an employee of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics made production 50 times faster by allowing a whole data card to be read at once, rather than one column at a time.\n\n\u2022 '''1941''' \u2013 Sample information was collected for the first time, meaning that 1 in 10 households were asked additional content about their dwelling (type, number of rooms, cooking fuel used, etc.).\n\n\u2022 '''1951''' \u2013The 1951 Census, held two years after Newfoundland (including Labrador) became part of Canada, marked Canada\u2019s first census as a nation of 10 provinces and 2 territories.<ref>Statistics Canada. \u201cHistory of the Census of Canada.\u201d ''2011 Census - About the Census'', 30 Dec. 2015, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/about-apropos/history-histoire-eng.cfm?wbdisable=true.</ref> The 1951 Census used \u201cmark-sense.\u201d This technology allowed punch cards to be generated, greatly reducing processing time and costs.\n\n\u2022 '''1956''' \u2013 A quinquennial (every five years) Census of Population and Census of Agriculture was held in all provinces across the country, replacing the mid-decade censuses of the Prairie provinces.\n\n\u2022 '''1971''' \u2013 Under the ''Statistics Act'' of 1971, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics was renamed Statistics Canada. The act also confirmed that a Census of Population and a Census of Agriculture would be taken every five years (quinquennially).\n\nSelf-enumeration was first introduced in 1971. With the exception of Indigenous reserves and remote areas where canvassing was deemed necessary due to logistical reasons and other limitations, census questionnaires and completion instructions were dropped off at private homes and respondents were asked to complete their own questionnaires. In population centres of 10,000 people or more, respondents were asked to mail their completed questionnaires back in a pre-addressed envelope. In other areas, questionnaires were picked up by census enumerators.\n\n\u2022 '''1991''' \u2013 All respondents in self-enumeration areas (over 98% of the population) were asked to return their completed census questionnaires by mail. The final return rate was 85%, and 27 million people in over 10 million households were counted.\n\nInformation on common-law partners was also collected for the first time.\n\n\u2022 '''2001''' \u2013 For the first time, data were collected on same-sex couples.\n\n\u2022 '''2006''' \u2013 Census questionnaires were delivered by Canada Post to about 70% of households. The remaining 30% received the questionnaire from an enumerator, as in previous censuses.\n\nFor the first time, all Canadians could answer the census questionnaire online. This was received positively by Canadians. \u00a0Nationally, 18.5% of Canadian households completed their questionnaire online.<ref>\u201c2006 Census: Nearly One in Five Households Completed Their Census Questionnaire Online.\u201d ''2006 Census: Nearly One in Five Households Completed Their Census Questionnaire Online'', 15 Oct. 2008, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/info/online-en_ligne-eng.cfm.</ref> This was also the first time people were asked if they agreed to have their personal information released in 92 years for the purposes of research and education.\n\nRespondents were also asked whether they would give Statistics Canada permission to access their tax files. This permission was sought in an effort to reduce response burden.\n\nThe definition of spouse was expanded to include same-sex married couples.\n\n\u2022 '''2011''' \u2013 The response to the online option in 2006 prompted a major change in methodology for the 2011 Census. In May, a letter was delivered to 60% of Canadian dwellings. This letter replaced the traditional paper questionnaire and explained how respondents could complete the questionnaire online.\n\nAbout 20% of dwellings received a questionnaire package by mail. For the remaining 20%, questionnaires were dropped off by enumerators.\n\nInformation previously collected by the mandatory long-form census questionnaire was collected as part of the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS).\n\nThe 2011 Census of Population questionnaire (short form) consisted of the same content as the 2006 Census short-form questionnaire, with the addition of two questions on language.\n\n\u2022 '''2016''' \u2013 In November 2015, the government reinstated the long-form census questionnaire, replacing the NHS. Most households (75%) received the short-form census questionnaire, while one in four households (25%) received the long-form questionnaire. The overall response at the end of collection for the 2016 Census was 98.4%, including 68.4% of responses received online, placing Canada at the forefront internationally for internet collection on a census.<ref>Statistics Canada. \u201c2016 Census of Population Collection Response Rates.\u201d ''Government of Canada, Statistics Canada'', 21 Feb. 2017, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/response-rates-eng.cfm.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Canada|History}}\n* [[Census geographic units of Canada]]\n* [[Census division statistics of Canada]]\n* [[Demographics of Canada]]\n* [[Canadian Census of Agriculture]]\n*[[Ethnic groups in Canada]]\n*[[List of largest Canadian cities by census]]\n*[[Population of Canada by year]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cite book\n|last = Statistics Canada \n|title = Canada Year Book (CYB) annual 1867\u20131967\n|publisher = Federal Publications (Queen of Canada)\n|location = Ottawa\n|year= 2008\n|id =\n|url=http://www65.statcan.gc.ca/acyb_r000-eng.htm\n }}\n* {{Cite book\n|last = Statistics Canada \n|title = Canada Year Book\n|publisher = Federal Publications (Queen of Canada)\n|location = Ottawa\n|date= October 27, 2010\n|id =Catalogue no 11-402-XPE\n|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-402-x/11-402-x2010000-eng.htm\n}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507060244/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/geo1.htm List of Census Tables from 1665 to 1871.]\n* [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/index-eng.cfm 2006 Census release topics]\n* [https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E 2016 Census Profile data]\n\n{{Census-ca}}\n{{North America topic|Census in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Census In Canada}}\n[[Category:Statistics Canada]]\n[[Category:Censuses in Canada| ]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Canada|Census]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Enumeration of the population of Canada}}\n[[Statistics Canada]] conducts a national [[census]] of population and [[Canadian Census of Agriculture|census of agriculture]] every five years. \n\nThe Census of Population provides [[Demographics of Canada|demographic]] and statistical data that is used to plan public services such as health care, education, and transportation; determine federal [[transfer payment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www22.statcan.ca/ccr08/ccr08_000_e.htm|title=The Census and...|accessdate=2006-05-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428182327/http://www22.statcan.ca/ccr08/ccr08_000_e.htm|archivedate=2006-04-28}}</ref> and determine the number of [[House of Commons of Canada#Members and electoral districts|Members of Parliament]] for each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]].

Extant records held by [[Library and Archives Canada]] and commonly used for research include 1825, 1831, 1842, 1852, and 1861.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/Pages/census.aspx|title=Censuses|last=Canada|first=Library and Archives|date=2012-10-04|website=www.bac-lac.gc.ca|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\n\u2022 '''1867''' \u2013 The ''Constitution Act, 1867'' (formerly the ''British North America Act, 1867'') included the requirement that a census must be taken every 10 years (decennially) to determine representation by population in the new parliament.\n\n\u2022 '''1871''' \u2013 The first decennial census was taken in this year. The census enumerated the population of the four original provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario). Manitoba and British Columbia, which had also joined Confederation, were surveyed separately. For the first time, questions on religion and birthplace were asked in the census.\n\nThe 1871 Census was the first to use the de jure method of enumeration rather than the de facto method used in Europe both then and now. The de facto method enumerates people where they are found on Census Day. The de jure method enumerates people according to their usual place of residence.\n\n\u2022 '''1881''' \u2013 All census enumerators were required to take an oath of secrecy\u2014a pledge still required today. The census was extended to include British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island.\n\n\u2022 '''1891''' \u2013 The population was prepared for the census enumerator\u2019s visit through announcements in newspapers and from pulpits.\n\n\u2022 '''1896''' \u2013 A mid-decade census was held in Manitoba beginning in 1896 and then in Saskatchewan and Alberta beginning in 1906. These censuses were needed to measure the rapid growth taking place in the West.\n\n\u2022 '''1901''' \u2013 Census content was expanded to include citizenship and period of immigration.\n\n\u2022 '''1905''' \u2013 The census office became a permanent bureau of the federal government.\n\n\u2022 '''1906''' \u2013 Beginning in 1906, the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan began to take separate censuses of population and agriculture every five years to monitor the growth of the West.\n\n\u2022 '''1912''' \u2013 Responsibility for conducting the census was transferred from the former Ministry of Agriculture to the former Ministry of Trade and Commerce.\n\n\u2022 '''1918''' \u2013 The Dominion Bureau of Statistics was created.\n\n\u2022 '''1931''' \u2013 Even though compilation and tabulation for the 1931 Census were still carried out with mechanical equipment, a new sorter-tabulator developed by an employee of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics made production 50 times faster by allowing a whole data card to be read at once, rather than one column at a time.\n\n\u2022 '''1941''' \u2013 Sample information was collected for the first time, meaning that 1 in 10 households were asked additional content about their dwelling (type, number of rooms, cooking fuel used, etc.).\n\n\u2022 '''1951''' \u2013The 1951 Census, held two years after Newfoundland (including Labrador) became part of Canada, marked Canada\u2019s first census as a nation of 10 provinces and 2 territories.<ref>Statistics Canada. \u201cHistory of the Census of Canada.\u201d ''2011 Census - About the Census'', 30 Dec. 2015, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/about-apropos/history-histoire-eng.cfm?wbdisable=true.</ref> The 1951 Census used \u201cmark-sense.\u201d This technology allowed punch cards to be generated, greatly reducing processing time and costs.\n\n\u2022 '''1956''' \u2013 A quinquennial (every five years) Census of Population and Census of Agriculture was held in all provinces across the country, replacing the mid-decade censuses of the Prairie provinces.\n\n\u2022 '''1971''' \u2013 Under the ''Statistics Act'' of 1971, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics was renamed Statistics Canada. The act also confirmed that a Census of Population and a Census of Agriculture would be taken every five years (quinquennially).\n\nSelf-enumeration was first introduced in 1971. With the exception of Indigenous reserves and remote areas where canvassing was deemed necessary due to logistical reasons and other limitations, census questionnaires and completion instructions were dropped off at private homes and respondents were asked to complete their own questionnaires. In population centres of 10,000 people or more, respondents were asked to mail their completed questionnaires back in a pre-addressed envelope. In other areas, questionnaires were picked up by census enumerators.\n\n\u2022 '''1991''' \u2013 All respondents in self-enumeration areas (over 98% of the population) were asked to return their completed census questionnaires by mail. The final return rate was 85%, and 27 million people in over 10 million households were counted.\n\nInformation on common-law partners was also collected for the first time.\n\n\u2022 '''2001''' \u2013 For the first time, data were collected on same-sex couples.\n\n\u2022 '''2006''' \u2013 Census questionnaires were delivered by Canada Post to about 70% of households. The remaining 30% received the questionnaire from an enumerator, as in previous censuses.\n\nFor the first time, all Canadians could answer the census questionnaire online. This was received positively by Canadians. \u00a0Nationally, 18.5% of Canadian households completed their questionnaire online.<ref>\u201c2006 Census: Nearly One in Five Households Completed Their Census Questionnaire Online.\u201d ''2006 Census: Nearly One in Five Households Completed Their Census Questionnaire Online'', 15 Oct. 2008, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/info/online-en_ligne-eng.cfm.</ref> This was also the first time people were asked if they agreed to have their personal information released in 92 years for the purposes of research and education.\n\nRespondents were also asked whether they would give Statistics Canada permission to access their tax files. This permission was sought in an effort to reduce response burden.\n\nThe definition of spouse was expanded to include same-sex married couples.\n\n\u2022 '''2011''' \u2013 The response to the online option in 2006 prompted a major change in methodology for the 2011 Census. In May, a letter was delivered to 60% of Canadian dwellings. This letter replaced the traditional paper questionnaire and explained how respondents could complete the questionnaire online.\n\nAbout 20% of dwellings received a questionnaire package by mail. For the remaining 20%, questionnaires were dropped off by enumerators.\n\nInformation previously collected by the mandatory long-form census questionnaire was collected as part of the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS).\n\nThe 2011 Census of Population questionnaire (short form) consisted of the same content as the 2006 Census short-form questionnaire, with the addition of two questions on language.\n\n\u2022 '''2016''' \u2013 In November 2015, the government reinstated the long-form census questionnaire, replacing the NHS. Most households (75%) received the short-form census questionnaire, while one in four households (25%) received the long-form questionnaire. The overall response at the end of collection for the 2016 Census was 98.4%, including 68.4% of responses received online, placing Canada at the forefront internationally for internet collection on a census.<ref>Statistics Canada. \u201c2016 Census of Population Collection Response Rates.\u201d ''Government of Canada, Statistics Canada'', 21 Feb. 2017, www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/response-rates-eng.cfm.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Canada|History}}\n* [[Census geographic units of Canada]]\n* [[Census division statistics of Canada]]\n* [[Demographics of Canada]]\n* [[Canadian Census of Agriculture]]\n*[[Ethnic groups in Canada]]\n*[[List of largest Canadian cities by census]]\n*[[Population of Canada by year]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cite book\n|last = Statistics Canada \n|title = Canada Year Book (CYB) annual 1867\u20131967\n|publisher = Federal Publications (Queen of Canada)\n|location = Ottawa\n|year= 2008\n|id =\n|url=http://www65.statcan.gc.ca/acyb_r000-eng.htm\n }}\n* {{Cite book\n|last = Statistics Canada \n|title = Canada Year Book\n|publisher = Federal Publications (Queen of Canada)\n|location = Ottawa\n|date= October 27, 2010\n|id =Catalogue no 11-402-XPE\n|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-402-x/11-402-x2010000-eng.htm\n}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507060244/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/geo1.htm List of Census Tables from 1665 to 1871.]\n* [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/index-eng.cfm 2006 Census release topics]\n* [https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E 2016 Census Profile data]\n\n{{Census-ca}}\n{{North America topic|Census in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Census In Canada}}\n[[Category:Statistics Canada]]\n[[Category:Censuses in Canada| ]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Canada|Census]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Punctuation for adjective form", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_in_Canada"}

{"title_page": "K-T-B", "text_new": "{{short description|Root of a number of Semitic words}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}\n'''K-T-B''' is a [[triconsonantal]] root of a number of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words, typically those having to do with writing.\n\nThe words for \"office\", \"writer\" and \"record\" all reflect this root. Most notably, the Arabic word ''kitab'' (\"book\") is also used in a number of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages]], as well as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. One cultural example would be the Mishnaic expression ''Katuv'' or the [[cognate]] Arabic expression transliterated as ''Maktoub'', which may be translated as \"it is written\". Another would be the ''[[Koutoubia]]'' mosque of [[Marrakech]], whose name is taken from the librarians and booksellers who once occupied that area.\n\n== Arabic derivatives ==\nA full account of

Ethiopic-derived languages use a completely different root (\u1e63-\u1e25-f) for the verb \"to write\" (this root exists in Arabic and is used to form words with a close meaning to \"writing\", such as ''\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101fa'' \"journalism\", and ''\u1e63a\u1e25\u012bfa'' \"newspaper\" or \"parchment\"). In the Persian language family (Farsi, Dari, Tajik, etc.) the borrowed word Kitab is the most commonly used word for \"book\".\n\n{{Semitic roots}}\n\n[[Category:Triconsonantal roots]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Root of a number of Semitic words}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}\n'''K-T-B''' is a [[triconsonantal]] root of a number of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words, typically those having to do with writing.\n\nThe words for \"office\", \"writer\" and \"record\" all reflect this root. Most notably, the Arabic word ''kitab'' (\"book\") is also used in a number of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages]], as well as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. One cultural example would be the Mishnaic expression ''Katuv'' or the [[cognate]] Arabic expression transliterated as ''Maktoub'', which may be translated as \"it is written\". Another would be the ''[[Koutoubia]]'' mosque of [[Marrakech]], whose name is taken from the librarians and booksellers who once occupied that area.\n\n== Arabic derivatives ==\nA full account of

The elder Parker, who had moved his family to [[Rye (city), New York|Rye, New York]], disapproved of the whole business, and although Richard Jr. himself appeared in a few plays at Brooks Preparatory School, he then had no intention of becoming an actor.

He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'').

Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was equal in beauty to the [[Nereid]]s, drew the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], which destroyed man and beast. The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]].

On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'').

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''. The name of ''Polydectes'', \"receiver of many\", characterizes his role as intended host but is also a [[euphemism]] for the Lord of the Underworld, as in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Demeter 9, 17.</ref> Polydectes requested that the guests bring horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of [[Hippodamia]], daughter of Oinomaos. Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it. Polydectes held Perseus to his rash promise and demanded the head of the only mortal [[Gorgon]],<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]].''

Zeus gave him an [[adamant]]ine sword (a [[Harpe]]) and Hades' [[Cap of invisibility|helm of darkness]] to hide. Hermes lent Perseus [[Talaria|winged sandals]] to fly, and Athena gave him a polished shield. Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave.\n\nIn the cave he came upon the sleeping [[Medusa]]. By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head. From her neck sprang [[Pegasus]] (\"he who sprang\") and [[Chrysaor]] (\"sword of gold\"), the result of Poseidon and Medusa's mating. The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.  37\u201339.</ref> but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped.

This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]].  Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was equal in beauty to the [[Nereid]]s, drew the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], which destroyed man and beast. The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore. Perseus slew the monster and, setting her free, claimed her in marriage.\n\n[[Image:Perseus and andromeda amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Perseus rescuing Andromeda from Cetus, depicted on an [[amphora]] in the [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]\n\nPerseus married Andromeda in spite of [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]], to whom she had before been promised.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].</ref> After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille]]) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.\n\nAs Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]],<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', IV.</ref> the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut [[Mopsus]]. On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].
