Because of this each sole was marked, but instead of S for sole, someone picked up the K stamp. During the 1930s the company took on several failing retail agents, but it was not until the purchase and splitting up of Abbotts in 1937, did the K Shoe Shop appear. By 1980 the business had 230 branches in the UK, and agreed to a merger with Clarks in 1981 to starve off a takeover from another company.

A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a [[coat of arms]] (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a [[banner of arms]]. Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message.\n\n[[Banner-making]] is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.\n\nThe word derives from [[Old French]] ''baniere'' (modern {{lang-fr|banni\u00e8re}}), from Late Latin ''bandum'', which was borrowed from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] source (compare {{lang-got|\ud800\udf31\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf45\ud800\udf30|translit=bandwa}}).

In the vexillum the cloth was draped from a horizontal crossbar suspended from the staff; this is unlike most modern flags in which the 'hoist' of the cloth is attached directly to the vertical [[Staff (military)|staff]].\n\n==Heraldic banners==<!-- This section is linked from [[Flag]] -->\n{{Further|Heraldic flag}}\n\nA heraldic banner, also called a [[banner of arms]], displays the basic [[coat of arms]] only:  i.e. it shows the design usually displayed on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and omits the crest, helmet or coronet, mantling, supporters, motto or any other elements associated with the full [[achievement (heraldry)|armorial achievement]] (for further details of these elements, see [[heraldry]]). A heraldic banner is usually square or rectangular.\n\nA distinction exists between the heraldic banner and the [[heraldic standard]]. The distinction, however, is often misunderstood or ignored.

However, the emphasis has, in recent years, shifted markedly towards the permanent or transient display of banners on walls or pillars of churches and other places of worship. A famous example of large banners on display is [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Liverpool R.C. Cathedral]], where the banners are designed by a resident artist.\n\nBanners are also used to communicate the [[Religious testimony|testimony]] of Jesus Christ by [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s and public ministers engaged in [[Open Air Preaching]].\n\n==Trade union banners==\n[[File:TU banners.JPG|thumb|Banners of [[Association of University Teachers|AUT]], [[National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education|NATFHE]], Cambridge [[Labour council|TUC]] and [[Cambridge University Students' Union]].]]\n\nThe [[iconography]] of these banners included mines, mills, factories, but also visions of the future, showing a land where children and adults were well-fed and living in tidy brick-built houses, where the old and sick were cared for, where the burden of work was lessened by new technology, and where leisure time was increasing. The same kind of banners are also used in many other countries. Many, but not all of them, have [[red]] as a dominant colour.\n\n[[File:Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia, Union Banner A928321h.jpg|thumb|Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia, Union Banner A928321h]]\n\nIn [[Australia]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, trade union banners were unfurled with pride in annual Eight Hour Day marches which advocated \u2018Eight Hours Labour, Eight Hours Recreation and Eight Hours Rest\u2019. These marches were one of the most prominent annual celebrations staged in Australia by any group. In Sydney alone, by the early twentieth century, thousands of unionists representing up to seventy different unions would take part in such parades, marching behind the banner emblematic of their trade. Most of these banners have not survived; the Labour Council of NSW has the largest surviving collection at [[Sydney Trades Hall]] Sydney Trades Hall in Sussex Street, Sydney.\n\nThe [[State Library of NSW]] in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] has a small collection of trade union banners that were donated to the Library in the early 1970s such as a Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia banner thought to have been made c. 1913-1919. The Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia was formed in 1873 and joined the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union in 1972.\n\nThe banner features a kneeling figure in the centre surrounded by scroll work and is decorated with Australian native flowers and images representative of the work of the Union's members such as a New South Wales Government Railways 34 class steam locomotive, the Hawkesbury River rail bridge built in 1889, and a furnace. The reverse of the banner shows the warship \"Australia\" at sea. The banner is canvas and was painted by Sydney firm Althouse & Geiger, master painters and decorators. Founded in 1875, the company is still in operation. The banner is a powerful interpretive tool in communicating the experience and the history of the Australian labour movement.\n\nFor more on the [[design]] and making of these banners, see [[Banner-making]].\n\n==Sports banners==\n[[File:TIFO FCN.jpg|thumb|[[FC Nantes]] banner]]\n\nSports fans often buy or make banners to display in the grandstands. Team banners typically contain the logo, name or nickname, motto and the team colors. Banners on individual competitors can contain a picture or drawing of the player. Sports banners may also honor notable players or hall-of-fame athletes and commemorate past championships won. These types of sports banners are typically hung from [[rafter]]s in stadiums. The [[Miami Heat]], an [[NBA]] Team, hangs division titles and [[championship]] banners at the top of the rafters in their home stadium, [[American Airlines Arena]]. Similar to other sports banners, they feature the color palette of the team's logo, the logo, names of players, and championship winning years.  In North American indoor professional sports, the previous season's champion traditionally does not install their awarded championship banner until moments prior to their first home game of the season that follows, in a procedure that is chiefly referred to as \"raising the banner\".\n\nUruguay's [[Club Nacional de Football]] supporters made a 600 x 50 metre banner that weighs over 2 tonnes; they claim it is the largest in the world.<ref>[http://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/120811/futnac-657139/futbolnacional/gigante-como-su-hinchada/ Gigante como su hinchada] - Diario Ovci\u00f3n, August 11, 2012</ref> It was unveiled in April 2013 in a [[Copa Libertadores]] football match at the [[Estadio Centenario]].\n\n==Advertising banners==\nOften fabricated commercially on a plastic background, the banner industry has developed from the traditional cut-vinyl banners to banners printed within large, ultra-wide format [[inkjet printer]]s on various vinyl and fabric materials using [[solvent ink]]s and [[ultraviolet-curable ink]]s.\n\nBanners are used in many business ventures, marketing to their potential audience. A number of British towns and cities have whole series of banners decorating their city centers, effectively advertising the town or its special features and attractions.  Pre-printed banners, albeit commonly used, are simple and accessible.  Banners can be printed in enormous formats, with a full range of rich colors. They can also be used in many different physical situations whether it be hanging from an existing fixture, fixed to a wall or even free standing. When an advertising banner is hung or suspended between posts, grommets or another method of attachment are necessary to prevent the banner from tearing or flying away. Aluminum grommets can be punched into the banner and used as secure entry points to tie the banner down. This installation method allows for more durable advertisements. Some vendors offer pre-installed [[grommets]]. Another common form of free standing banners are retractable displays.\n\nBanners can be found plastered behind a window screen, as billboards, atop skyscrapers, or [[aerial advertising|towed by airplanes or blimps]]. As with variable of size and quantity, the number of sides and quality of ink are as much of a crucial factor. In an instance of retail stores which purchase pre-printed clearance banners, or a variety of sale banner. A banner facing underneath or against glass is absorbing exposure from the sun. A banner printed on UV outdoor ink will last several years to a decade where cheaper ink fades, requiring frequent replacement. Being behind glass, a two-sided banner can be displayed from the inside and out, often building recognition between shoppers and caretakers. Three-sided banners are often appealing as there is dimension and can be embellished differently. The more sides that exist, the more angles the banner covers, which is a possibility where a two-sided banner doesn't face the viewer from center of the room or streets.\n\nAnother manifestation of advertising banners, unique to the 21st century, are \"[[banner ad]]s\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/banner+ad|title=Banner ad - Define Banner ad at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> which are advertisements on websites. The banner ads contain hyperlinks to other websites. Also, on free music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora, audio advertisements will play in between songs. One of the common tag lines is \"Click the banner to learn more.\"\n\n==Big letter banners (China)==\nIn China, it is common to find large red coloured banners, especially in schools, factories, government institutions and construction sites. Also called da zi bao ({{zh|s=\u5927\u5b57\u62a5|p=d\u00e0z\u00ecb\u00e0o|l=big-character reports}}), these tend to be big and long, usually with red backgrounds and large Chinese characters. They tend to have motivational messages or industrial milestones on them. Historically, these [[Big-character poster|big character posters]] (da zi bao) were used to convey messages during the [[cultural revolution]], but their use changed after the country's liberalization since 1979.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harvard exhibit showcases Chinese posters hidden for 50 years |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/entertainmentlife/20171119/harvard-exhibit-showcases-chinese-posters-hidden-for-50-years |accessdate=4 June 2018 |publisher=Milford Daily News |date=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n*[[Banners in Northern Ireland]]\n*[[County Clare]] in [[Ireland]] is known as the ''Banner County''.\n*[[Gonfalone]]\n*[[Heraldic standard]]\n*[[Jolly Roger]]\n*[[Knight Banneret]]\n*[[Nobori]]\n*[[Sashimono]]\n*[[Stainless Banner]]\n*''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''\n*[[Vexillum]]\n*[[Vinyl banners]]\n*[[Web banner]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Banners}}\n\n[[Category:Types of flags]]\n[[Category:Signage]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\nA '''banner''' can be a [[flag]] or other piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or other message.

In North American indoor professional sports, the previous season's champion traditionally does not install their awarded championship banner until moments prior to their first home game of the season that follows, in a procedure that is chiefly referred to as \"raising the banner\".\n\nUruguay's [[Club Nacional de Football]] supporters made a 600 x 50 metre banner that weighs over 2 tonnes; they claim it is the largest in the world.<ref>[http://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/120811/futnac-657139/futbolnacional/gigante-como-su-hinchada/ Gigante como su hinchada] - Diario Ovci\u00f3n, August 11, 2012</ref> It was unveiled in April 2013 in a [[Copa Libertadores]] football match at the [[Estadio Centenario]].\n\n==Advertising banners==\nOften fabricated commercially on a plastic background, the banner industry has developed from the traditional cut-vinyl banners to banners printed within large, ultra-wide format [[inkjet printer]]s on various vinyl and fabric materials using [[solvent ink]]s and [[ultraviolet-curable ink]]s.\n\nBanners are used in many business ventures, marketing to their potential audience. A number of British towns and cities have whole series of banners decorating their city centers, effectively advertising the town or its special features and attractions.  Pre-printed banners, albeit commonly used, are simple and accessible.  Banners can be printed in enormous formats, with a full range of rich colors. They can also be used in many different physical situations whether it be hanging from an existing fixture, fixed to a wall or even free standing. When an advertising banner is hung or suspended between posts, grommets or another method of attachment are necessary to prevent the banner from tearing or flying away. Aluminum grommets can be punched into the banner and used as secure entry points to tie the banner down. This installation method allows for more durable advertisements. Some vendors offer pre-installed [[grommets]]. Another common form of free standing banners are retractable displays.\n\nBanners can be found plastered behind a window screen, as billboards, atop skyscrapers, or [[aerial advertising|towed by airplanes or blimps]]. As with variable of size and quantity, the number of sides and quality of ink are as much of a crucial factor. In an instance of retail stores which purchase pre-printed clearance banners, or a variety of sale banner. A banner facing underneath or against glass is absorbing exposure from the sun. A banner printed on UV outdoor ink will last several years to a decade where cheaper ink fades, requiring frequent replacement. Being behind glass, a two-sided banner can be displayed from the inside and out, often building recognition between shoppers and caretakers. Three-sided banners are often appealing as there is dimension and can be embellished differently. The more sides that exist, the more angles the banner covers, which is a possibility where a two-sided banner doesn't face the viewer from center of the room or streets.\n\nAnother manifestation of advertising banners, unique to the 21st century, are \"[[banner ad]]s\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/banner+ad|title=Banner ad - Define Banner ad at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> which are advertisements on websites. The banner ads contain hyperlinks to other websites. Also, on free music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora, audio advertisements will play in between songs. One of the common tag lines is \"Click the banner to learn more.\"\n\n==Big letter banners (China)==\nIn China, it is common to find large red coloured banners, especially in schools, factories, government institutions and construction sites. Also called da zi bao ({{zh|s=\u5927\u5b57\u62a5|p=d\u00e0z\u00ecb\u00e0o|l=big-character reports}}), these tend to be big and long, usually with red backgrounds and large Chinese characters. They tend to have motivational messages or industrial milestones on them. Historically, these [[Big-character poster|big character posters]] (da zi bao) were used to convey messages during the [[cultural revolution]], but their use changed after the country's liberalization since 1979.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harvard exhibit showcases Chinese posters hidden for 50 years |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/entertainmentlife/20171119/harvard-exhibit-showcases-chinese-posters-hidden-for-50-years |accessdate=4 June 2018 |publisher=Milford Daily News |date=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n*[[Banners in Northern Ireland]]\n*[[County Clare]] in [[Ireland]] is known as the ''Banner County''.\n*[[Gonfalone]]\n*[[Heraldic standard]]\n*[[Jolly Roger]]\n*[[Knight Banneret]]\n*[[Nobori]]\n*[[Sashimono]]\n*[[Stainless Banner]]\n*''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''\n*[[Vexillum]]\n*[[Vinyl banners]]\n*[[Web banner]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Banners}}\n\n[[Category:Types of flags]]\n[[Category:Signage]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromOld testamenttoOld Testamentusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner"}

Produced by [[TMS Entertainment]] under partnership with Sega and [[Sonic Team]], and directed by Hajime Kamegaki, ''Sonic X'' initially ran for fifty-two episodes, broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. A further 26 episodes aired only in specific regions, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] from 2005 to 2006. The show's American [[language localization|localization]] and broadcasting were handled by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]]\u2014which [[editing of anime in American distribution|edited it]] and created new music\u2014until 2012, when [[Saban Brands]] obtained the rights to the series, and in 2015 by [[Discotek Media]].\n\nThe series follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals who accidentally teleport from their home planet to [[Earth]] after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy [[Doctor Eggman]]. Separated, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is saved by a [[human]] boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], and becoming [[celebrities]]. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.</onlyinclude>\n\nGenerally, writers criticized its American localization and some characters, but praised its story and aesthetics. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase \"gotta go fast\", the title of the show's North American theme song, survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}\n\n===Season 1===\n[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Amy Rose]] are trying to rescue [[Cream the Rabbit]] and her pet [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]] Cheese from [[Doctor Eggman]], who has already retrieved the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]]. While attempting to destroy his base, one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the \"Chaos Control\" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman (and his robots), Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese, as well as [[Big the Cat]] (with his frog Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and the [[Chaotix]] (a [[detective]] crew comprising [[Espio the Chameleon]], [[Vector the Crocodile]], and [[Charmy Bee]]) to [[Earth]], the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world with [[humans]]. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the anthropomorphic friends from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.\n\nSonic and his friends still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants\u2014the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe\u2014and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.\n\n===Season 2===\nEggman awakens a creature named [[Chaos (Sonic)|Chaos]] from the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]], he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.\n\nShortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the Space Colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause Space Colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed for the death of his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on Space Colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria's last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity, to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process.  Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.\n\nEggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], so he manufactures and sells \"Sunshine Balls\" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the anthropomorphic people, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, forcing Cream and Cheese to destroy him.\n\nLater, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that Sonic's world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.\n\n===Season 3===\nSix months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where [[time dilation|six years have passed]] and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to his friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, ''The Blue Typhoon''. On the ''Typhoon'', they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and \"Planet Eggs\" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.)  At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metarex independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an [[undercover agent|unwitting spy ever since]]. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely [[deafblindness|destroy her sight and hearing]] forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses to find a way to remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.\n\nThe heroes, along with the Chaotix and Shadow, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. The Metarex then proceed to fuse together, forming a dragon-like plant monster that attaches itself to the giant seed. Sonic and Shadow use the chaos emerald to become Super Sonic and Super Shadow but are still unable to defeat the fused Metarex. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed. Tails hesitates, torn between saving the galaxy and killing Cosmo, but eventually finds the inner strength and annihilates the Metarex along with Cosmo, whose seed disperse throughout the galaxy along with the Planet Eggs stolen by the Metarex which return to their original planets. Dark Oak has a moment of repentance before dying while having a vision of being greeted by Earthia as he passes away. Shadow then apparently sacrifices himself to contain the ensuing explosion. After the battle, Sonic reappears and solemnly informs a heartbroken Tails that he could not save Cosmo and hands him one of her seeds. Back on Sonic's planet Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, later claiming that this was done to reduce the strength of Team Sonic. The series ends with Chris returning home and business as usual for Sonic and his friends as they joyfully gear up to once again put a stop to Eggman's schemes. The final shots show Shadow on an alien planet and Cosmo's seed sprouting in Tails' workshop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and development===\nThe show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]], the animation subsidiary of SEGA Holdings Co., Ltd.<ref name=\"them\"/> It was the first [[anime]] series based on the ''Sonic'' universe.

Chris' voice actress [[Sanae Kobayashi]] was not sure she would be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal.

It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Trading card game===\n[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |publisher=KidzWorld |title=Sonic X Card Game Review |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814102446/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |archivedate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nConrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its \"horrible localization\" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name=\"negativity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter |last=Zimmerman |first=Conrad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122419/http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: \"It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers.\"<ref name=\"them\">{{cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |publisher=THEM Anime |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Sonic X |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915060412/http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |archivedate=September 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive.

Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: {{\" '}}I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Rings|Ring]] to defeat my enemies{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"them\"/> GamesRadar bemoaned both the \"piss-poor ''Adventure'' characters\" and the original human ones.<ref name=\"gamesradar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |author=GamesRadar_US |date=June 23, 2012 |title=The absolute worst Sonic moments |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010191612/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |archivedate=October 10, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that \"one of the key successes\" of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix.

Produced by [[TMS Entertainment]] under partnership with Sega and [[Sonic Team]], and directed by Hajime Kamegaki, ''Sonic X'' initially ran for fifty-two episodes, broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. A further 26 episodes aired only in specific regions, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] from 2005 to 2006. The show's American [[language localization|localization]] and broadcasting were handled by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]]\u2014which [[editing of anime in American distribution|edited it]] and created new music\u2014until 2012, when [[Saban Brands]] obtained the rights to the series, and in 2015 by [[Discotek Media]].\n\nThe series follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals who accidentally teleport from their home planet to [[Earth]] after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy [[Doctor Eggman]]. Separated, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is saved by a [[human]] boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], and becoming [[celebrities]]. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.</onlyinclude>\n\nGenerally, writers criticized its American localization and some characters, but praised its story and aesthetics. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase \"gotta go fast\", the title of the show's North American theme song, survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}\n\n===Season 1===\n[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Amy Rose]] are trying to rescue [[Cream the Rabbit]] and her pet [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]] Cheese from [[Doctor Eggman]], who has already retrieved the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]]. While attempting to destroy his base, one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the \"Chaos Control\" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman (and his robots), Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese, as well as [[Big the Cat]] (with his frog Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and the [[Chaotix]] (a [[detective]] crew comprising [[Espio the Chameleon]], [[Vector the Crocodile]], and [[Charmy Bee]]) to [[Earth]], the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world with [[humans]]. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the anthropomorphic friends from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.\n\nSonic and his friends still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants\u2014the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe\u2014and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.\n\n===Season 2===\nEggman awakens a creature named [[Chaos (Sonic)|Chaos]] from the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]], he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.\n\nShortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the Space Colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause Space Colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed for the death of his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on Space Colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria's last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity, to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process.  Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.\n\nEggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], so he manufactures and sells \"Sunshine Balls\" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the anthropomorphic people, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, forcing Cream and Cheese to destroy him.\n\nLater, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that Sonic's world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.\n\n===Season 3===\nSix months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where [[time dilation|six years have passed]] and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to his friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, ''The Blue Typhoon''. On the ''Typhoon'', they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and \"Planet Eggs\" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.)  At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metarex independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an [[undercover agent|unwitting spy ever since]]. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely [[deafblindness|destroy her sight and hearing]] forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses to find a way to remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.\n\nThe heroes, along with the Chaotix and Shadow, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. The Metarex then proceed to fuse together, forming a dragon-like plant monster that attaches itself to the giant seed. Sonic and Shadow use the chaos emerald to become Super Sonic and Super Shadow but are still unable to defeat the fused Metarex. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed. Tails hesitates, torn between saving the galaxy and killing Cosmo, but eventually finds the inner strength and annihilates the Metarex along with Cosmo, whose seed disperse throughout the galaxy along with the Planet Eggs stolen by the Metarex which return to their original planets. Dark Oak has a moment of repentance before dying while having a vision of being greeted by Earthia as he passes away. Shadow then apparently sacrifices himself to contain the ensuing explosion. After the battle, Sonic reappears and solemnly informs a heartbroken Tails that he could not save Cosmo and hands him one of her seeds. Back on Sonic's planet Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, later claiming that this was done to reduce the strength of Team Sonic. The series ends with Chris returning home and business as usual for Sonic and his friends as they joyfully gear up to once again put a stop to Eggman's schemes. The final shots show Shadow on an alien planet and Cosmo's seed sprouting in Tails' workshop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and development===\nThe show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]], the animation subsidiary of SEGA Holdings Co., Ltd.<ref name=\"them\"/> It was the first [[anime]] series based on the ''Sonic'' universe.

Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/ |publisher=Games Asylum |last=Gander |first=Matt (of [[Retro Gamer]]) |date=April 17, 2013 |title=The history of fast-food freebies |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825171204/http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/ |archivedate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[LeapFrog Enterprises]] released a ''[[Sonic X (video game)|Sonic X]]'' [[educational entertainment|educational]] math game for its [[Leapster]] handheld game console; it was released in 2005 in North America<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, North American) boxart.</ref> and 2007 in Europe.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, European) boxart.</ref> The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Trading card game===\n[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |publisher=KidzWorld |title=Sonic X Card Game Review |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814102446/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |archivedate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nConrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its \"horrible localization\" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name=\"negativity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter |last=Zimmerman |first=Conrad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122419/http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: \"It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers.\"<ref name=\"them\">{{cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |publisher=THEM Anime |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Sonic X |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915060412/http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |archivedate=September 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive.

He also found the backgrounds \"nice to look at\" but did not like the use of CGI for Sonic's homing attack.<ref name=\"them\"/>\n\nThe human characters and, to a lesser extent, the animal ones were also criticized. Jones decried Chris as \"a dull, boring, uninspired character\" and also described Tanaka and Ella as \"bland\" stereotypes of [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|Japanese]] and [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-Americans]], respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: {{\" '}}I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Rings|Ring]] to defeat my enemies{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"them\"/> GamesRadar bemoaned both the \"piss-poor ''Adventure'' characters\" and the original human ones.<ref name=\"gamesradar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |author=GamesRadar_US |date=June 23, 2012 |title=The absolute worst Sonic moments |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010191612/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |archivedate=October 10, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that \"one of the key successes\" of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix.

It was not a [[legislative body]] in the contemporary sense; its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref>  \n\nIts members were the [[Imperial Estate]]s, divided into three colleges. The [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] as a permanent, regularized institution evolved from the ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (court assemblies) of the [[Middle Ages]]. From 1663 until the end of the empire in 1806, it was in [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|permanent session]] at [[Regensburg]].\n\nAll Imperial Estates enjoyed [[Imperial immediacy|immediacy]] and, therefore, they had no authority above them besides the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] himself. While all the estates were entitled to a seat and vote, only the higher temporal and spiritual princes of the College of Princes enjoyed an individual vote (''Virilstimme''), while lesser estates such as imperial counts and imperial abbots, were merely entitled to a collective vote (''Kuriatstimme'') within their particular bench (''Curia''), as did the free imperial cities belonging to the College of Towns. The right to vote rested essentially on a territorial entitlement, with the result that when a given prince acquired new territories through inheritance or otherwise, he also acquired their voting rights in the Diet.<ref>John H. Gagliardo, ''Reich and Nation. The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763\u20131806'', Indiana University Press, 1980, p. 22\u201323.</ref> In general, members did not attend the permanent diet at Regensburg, but sent representatives instead. The late imperial diet was in effect a permanent meeting of ambassadors between the Estates.\n\n== History ==\nThe precise role and function of the Imperial Diet changed over the centuries, as did the Empire itself, in that the estates and separate territories gained more and more control of their own affairs at the expense of imperial power. Initially, there was neither a fixed time nor location for the Diet. It started as a convention of the [[duke]]s of the old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that formed the [[Francia|Frankish kingdom]] when important decisions had to be made, and was probably based on the old Germanic law whereby each leader relied on the support of his leading men. For example, already under Emperor [[Charlemagne]] during the [[Saxon Wars]], the Diet, according to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], met at [[Paderborn]] in 777 and officially determined laws concerning the subdued [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxons]] and other tribes. In 803, the Frankish emperor issued the final version of the [[Lex Saxonum]].\n\nAt the Diet of 919 in [[Fritzlar]] the dukes elected the first [[List of German monarchs|King of the Germans]], who was a Saxon, [[Henry the Fowler]], thus overcoming the longstanding rivalry between Franks and Saxons and laying the foundation for the German realm. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]], the 1158 [[Diet of Roncaglia]] finalized four laws that would significantly alter the (never formally written) [[constitution]] of the Empire, marking the beginning of the steady decline of the central power in favour of the local dukes. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] cemented the concept of \"territorial rule\" (''Landesherrschaft''), the largely independent rule of the dukes over their respective territories, and also limited the number of electors to seven. The Pope, contrary to modern myth, was never involved in the electoral process but only in the process of ratification and coronation of whomever the Prince-Electors chose.\n[[File:Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms, signed by Charles V. The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n[[File:Luther (Wislicenus).jpg|thumb|\"Here I stand\": [[Martin Luther]] at the [[Diet of Worms]], 1521<br>19th-century painting by [[Hermann Wislicenus]]]]\nHowever, until the late 15th century, the Diet was not actually formalized as an institution. Instead, the dukes and other princes would irregularly convene at the court of the Emperor; these assemblies were usually referred to as ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (from German ''Hof'' \"court\"). Only beginning in 1489 was the Diet called the ''Reichstag'', and it was formally divided into several ''collegia'' (\"colleges\"). Initially, the two colleges were that of the [[prince-elector]]s and that of the other dukes and princes. Later, the [[free imperial city|imperial cities]], that is, cities that had [[Imperial immediacy]] and were oligarchic republics independent of a local ruler that were subject only to the Emperor himself, managed to be accepted as a third party.\n\nSeveral attempts to reform the Empire and end its slow disintegration, notably starting with the [[Diet of 1495]], did not have much effect. In contrast, this process was only hastened with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, which formally bound the Emperor to accept all decisions made by the Diet, in effect depriving him of his few remaining powers. From then to its end in 1806, the Empire was not much more than a collection of largely independent states.\n\nProbably the most famous Diets were those held in [[Diet of Worms|Worms]] in 1495, where the [[Imperial Reform]] was enacted, and [[Diet of Worms|1521]], where [[Martin Luther]] was banned (see [[Edict of Worms]]), the Diets of [[Speyer]] [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|1526]] and [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|1529]] (see  [[Protestation at Speyer]]), and several in [[Nuremberg]] ([[Diet of Nuremberg]]). Only with the introduction of the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]] in 1663 did the Diet permanently convene in a fixed location.\n\nThe Imperial Diet of Constance opened on 27 April 1507;<ref>History of the Reformation in Germany, page 70, by Leopold von Ranke.</ref> it recognized the unity of the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Imperial Chamber, the empire\u2019s supreme court.\n\n== Participants ==\nSince 1489, the Diet comprised three colleges:\n\n=== Electors ===\n[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|200px|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob K\u00f6bel]] (1545).]]\nThe [[Electoral College (Holy Roman Empire)|Electoral College]] (''Kurf\u00fcrstenrat''), led by the [[Electorate of Mainz|Prince-Archbishop of Mainz]] in his capacity as [[Archchancellor]] of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The seven Prince-electors were designated by the Golden Bull of 1356:\n* three ecclesiastical [[Prince-Bishop]]s,\n** the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz as Archchancellor of Germany\n** the [[Electorate of Cologne|Prince-Archbishop of Cologne]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]\n** the [[Electorate of Trier|Prince-Archbishop of Trier]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]\n*four secular Princes,\n** the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] as [[Cup-bearer|Archcupbearer]]\n** the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector of the Palatinate]] as [[Steward (office)|Archsteward]] (''Erztruchsess'')\n** the [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] as [[Marshal|Archmarshal]]\n** the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]] as [[Chamberlain (office)|Archchamberlain]]\n\nThe number increased to eight, when in 1623 the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]] took over the electoral dignity of the Count Palatine, who himself received a separate vote in the electoral college according to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] (''Causa Palatina''), including the high office of an [[Treasurer|Archtreasurer]]. In 1692 the [[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]] (formally Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg) became the ninth Prince-elector as Archbannerbearer during the [[Nine Years' War]].\n\nIn the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], the electoral dignities of the Palatinate and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] were merged, approved by the 1779 [[Treaty of Teschen]]. The [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 entailed the dissolution of the Cologne and Trier Prince-archbishoprics, the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz and German Archchancellor received\u2014as compensation for his lost territory occupied by [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]]\u2014the newly established [[Principality of Regensburg]]. In turn, four secular princes were elevated to prince-electors:\n* the [[Electorate of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]]\n* the [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n* the [[Electorate of Baden|Margrave of Baden]]\n* the [[Electorate of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]\nThese changes however had little effect, as with the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] as Holy Roman Emperor the Empire was dissolved only three years later.\n\n=== Princes ===\nThe college of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Princes]] (''Reichsf\u00fcrstenrat'' or ''F\u00fcrstenbank'') incorporated the [[Imperial Count]]s as well as [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] lords, [[Prince-Bishop]]s and [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbots]]. Strong in members, though often discordant, the second college tried to preserve its interests against the dominance of the Prince-electors.\n\nThe House of Princes was again subdivided into an ecclesiastical and a secular bench. Remarkably, the ecclesiastical bench was headed by the\u2014secular\u2014[[Archduchy of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] and the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] duke of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] (held by [[Habsburg Spain]] from 1556). As the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] had failed to assume the leadership of the secular bench, they received the guidance over the ecclesiastical princes instead. The first ecclesiastical prince was the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as ''[[Primas Germaniae]]''; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besan\u00e7on|Prince-Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on]], though officially a member until the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], did not attend the Diet's meetings.\n\nThe ecclesiastical bench also comprised the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] and ''Deutschmeister'' of the [[Teutonic Knights]], as well as the [[Prior|Grand Prior]] of the Monastic State of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at [[Heitersheim]]. The [[Bishopric of L\u00fcbeck|Prince-Bishopric of L\u00fcbeck]] remained an ecclesiastical member even after it had turned [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]], ruled by [[diocesan administrator]]s from the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|House of Holstein-Gottorp]] from 1586. The [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]], according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia was under alternating rule of a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] bishop and a Lutheran bishop from the [[House of Hanover]].\n\nEach member of the Princes' College held either a single vote (''Virilstimme'') or a collective vote (''Kuriatstimme''). Due to the Princes, their single vote from 1582 strictly depended on their immediate fiefs; this principle led to an accumulation of votes, when one ruler held several territories in [[personal union]]. Counts and Lords only were entitled to collective votes, they therefore formed separate colleges like the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]] and mergers within the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian]], the [[Franconian Circle|Franconian]] and the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]]s. Likewise, on the ecclesiastical bench, the Imperial abbots joined a Swabian or [[Rhine|Rhenish]] college.\n\nIn the German Mediatisation of 1803, numerous ecclesiastical territories were annexed by secular estates. A reform of the Princes' college was however not carried out until the Empire's dissolution in 1806.\n\n=== Cities ===\nThe college of [[Free imperial city|Imperial Cities]] (''Reichsst\u00e4dtekollegium'') evolved from 1489 onwards, it contributed greatly to the development of the Imperial Diets as a political institution. Nevertheless, the collective vote of the cities initially was of inferior importance until a 1582 [[Recess (Holy Roman Empire)|Recess]] of the [[Diet of Augsburg|Augsburg Diet]]. The college was led by the city council of the actual venue; with the implementation of the Perpetual Diet in 1663, the chair passed to [[Regensburg]].\n\nThe Imperial cities also divided into a Swabian and Rhenish bench. The Swabian cities were led by [[Nuremberg]], [[Augsburg]] and Regensburg, the Rhenish cities by [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFor a complete list of members of the Imperial Diet from 1792, near the end of the Empire, see [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]].\n\n== Religious bodies ==\n{{main|Itio in partes}}\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], religious matters could no longer be decided by a majority vote of the colleges. Instead, the Reichstag would separate into Catholic and Protestant bodies, which would discuss the matter separately and then negotiate an agreement with each other, a procedure called the ''[[itio in partes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peace Treaties of Westphalia (October 14/24, 1648)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/87.%20PeaceWestphalia_en.pdf|website=German History in Documents and Images|quote=In religious and all other affairs in which the estates cannot be considered as one body, and when the Catholic estates and those of the Augsburg Confession are divided into two parties, the dispute is to be decided by amicable agreement alone, and neither side is to be bound by a majority vote.}}</ref>  The Catholic body, or ''[[corpus catholicorum]]'', was headed by the Archbishop-Elector of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]].<ref name=\"kalipke\">{{cite book|last=Kalipke|first=Andreas|chapter=The Corpus Evangelicorum|title=The Holy Roman Empire, Reconsidered|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn|pages=228\u2013247|editors=Coy, Marschke, and Sabean}}</ref>\n\nThe Protestant body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]'', was headed by the Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]].  At meetings of the Protestant body, Saxony would introduce each topic of discussion, after which [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] would speak, followed by the remaining states in order of size.  When all the states had spoken, Saxony would weigh the votes and announce a consensus.\n\n[[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony]] converted to Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland, but the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant and retained the directorship of the Protestant body.  When [[Augustus III of Poland|the Elector's son]] also converted to Catholicism, Prussia and Hanover attempted to take over the directorship in 1717\u20131720, but without success.  The Electors of Saxony would head the Protestant body until the end of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=\"kalipke\"/>\n\n== Collection of records ==\nAfter the formation of the new [[German Empire]] in 1871, the Historical Commission of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] started to collect imperial records (''Reichsakten'') and imperial diet records (''Reichstagsakten''). In 1893 the commission published the first volume. At present the years 1524\u20131527 and years up to 1544 are being collected and researched. A volume dealing with the 1532 Diet of Regensburg, including the peace negotiations with the [[Protestants]] in [[Schweinfurt]] and [[Nuremberg]], by [[Rosemarie Aulinger]] of [[Vienna]] was published in 1992.\n\n== Locations of Imperial Diets ==\n:''Note: this list is incomplete''\n{|

It was not a [[legislative body]] in the contemporary sense; its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref>  \n\nIts members were the [[Imperial Estate]]s, divided into three colleges. The [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] as a permanent, regularized institution evolved from the ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (court assemblies) of the [[Middle Ages]]. From 1663 until the end of the empire in 1806, it was in [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|permanent session]] at [[Regensburg]].\n\nAll Imperial Estates enjoyed [[Imperial immediacy|immediacy]] and, therefore, they had no authority above them besides the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] himself. While all the estates were entitled to a seat and vote, only the higher temporal and spiritual princes of the College of Princes enjoyed an individual vote (''Virilstimme''), while lesser estates such as imperial counts and imperial abbots, were merely entitled to a collective vote (''Kuriatstimme'') within their particular bench (''Curia''), as did the free imperial cities belonging to the College of Towns. The right to vote rested essentially on a territorial entitlement, with the result that when a given prince acquired new territories through inheritance or otherwise, he also acquired their voting rights in the Diet<ref>John H. Gagliardo, ''Reich and Nation. The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763\u20131806'', Indiana University Press, 1980, p. 22\u201323.</ref> In general, members did not attend the permanent diet at Regensburg, but sent representatives instead. The late imperial diet was in effect a permanent meeting of ambassadors between the Estates.\n\n== History ==\nThe precise role and function of the Imperial Diet changed over the centuries, as did the Empire itself, in that the estates and separate territories gained more and more control of their own affairs at the expense of imperial power. Initially, there was neither a fixed time nor location for the Diet. It started as a convention of the [[duke]]s of the old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that formed the [[Francia|Frankish kingdom]] when important decisions had to be made, and was probably based on the old Germanic law whereby each leader relied on the support of his leading men. For example, already under Emperor [[Charlemagne]] during the [[Saxon Wars]], the Diet, according to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], met at [[Paderborn]] in 777 and officially determined laws concerning the subdued [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxons]] and other tribes. In 803, the Frankish emperor issued the final version of the [[Lex Saxonum]].\n\nAt the Diet of 919 in [[Fritzlar]] the dukes elected the first [[List of German monarchs|King of the Germans]], who was a Saxon, [[Henry the Fowler]], thus overcoming the longstanding rivalry between Franks and Saxons and laying the foundation for the German realm. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]], the 1158 [[Diet of Roncaglia]] finalized four laws that would significantly alter the (never formally written) [[constitution]] of the Empire, marking the beginning of the steady decline of the central power in favour of the local dukes. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] cemented the concept of \"territorial rule\" (''Landesherrschaft''), the largely independent rule of the dukes over their respective territories, and also limited the number of electors to seven. The Pope, contrary to modern myth, was never involved in the electoral process but only in the process of ratification and coronation of whomever the Prince-Electors chose.\n[[File:Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms, signed by Charles V. The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n[[File:Luther (Wislicenus).jpg|thumb|\"Here I stand\": [[Martin Luther]] at the [[Diet of Worms]], 1521<br>19th-century painting by [[Hermann Wislicenus]]]]\nHowever, until the late 15th century, the Diet was not actually formalized as an institution. Instead, the dukes and other princes would irregularly convene at the court of the Emperor; these assemblies were usually referred to as ''[[Hoftag]]e'' (from German ''Hof'' \"court\"). Only beginning in 1489 was the Diet called the ''Reichstag'', and it was formally divided into several ''collegia'' (\"colleges\"). Initially, the two colleges were that of the [[prince-elector]]s and that of the other dukes and princes. Later, the [[free imperial city|imperial cities]], that is, cities that had [[Imperial immediacy]] and were oligarchic republics independent of a local ruler that were subject only to the Emperor himself, managed to be accepted as a third party.\n\nSeveral attempts to reform the Empire and end its slow disintegration, notably starting with the [[Diet of 1495]], did not have much effect. In contrast, this process was only hastened with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, which formally bound the Emperor to accept all decisions made by the Diet, in effect depriving him of his few remaining powers. From then to its end in 1806, the Empire was not much more than a collection of largely independent states.\n\nProbably the most famous Diets were those held in [[Diet of Worms|Worms]] in 1495, where the [[Imperial Reform]] was enacted, and [[Diet of Worms|1521]], where [[Martin Luther]] was banned (see [[Edict of Worms]]), the Diets of [[Speyer]] [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|1526]] and [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|1529]] (see  [[Protestation at Speyer]]), and several in [[Nuremberg]] ([[Diet of Nuremberg]]). Only with the introduction of the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]] in 1663 did the Diet permanently convene in a fixed location.\n\nThe Imperial Diet of Constance opened on 27 April 1507;<ref>History of the Reformation in Germany, page 70, by Leopold von Ranke.</ref> it recognized the unity of the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Imperial Chamber, the empire\u2019s supreme court.\n\n== Participants ==\nSince 1489, the Diet comprised three colleges:\n\n=== Electors ===\n[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|200px|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob K\u00f6bel]] (1545).]]\nThe [[Electoral College (Holy Roman Empire)|Electoral College]] (''Kurf\u00fcrstenrat''), led by the [[Electorate of Mainz|Prince-Archbishop of Mainz]] in his capacity as [[Archchancellor]] of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The seven Prince-electors were designated by the Golden Bull of 1356:\n* three ecclesiastical [[Prince-Bishop]]s,\n** the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz as Archchancellor of Germany\n** the [[Electorate of Cologne|Prince-Archbishop of Cologne]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]\n** the [[Electorate of Trier|Prince-Archbishop of Trier]] as Archchancellor of [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]\n*four secular Princes,\n** the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] as [[Cup-bearer|Archcupbearer]]\n** the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector of the Palatinate]] as [[Steward (office)|Archsteward]] (''Erztruchsess'')\n** the [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] as [[Marshal|Archmarshal]]\n** the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]] as [[Chamberlain (office)|Archchamberlain]]\n\nThe number increased to eight, when in 1623 the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]] took over the electoral dignity of the Count Palatine, who himself received a separate vote in the electoral college according to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] (''Causa Palatina''), including the high office of an [[Treasurer|Archtreasurer]]. In 1692 the [[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]] (formally Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg) became the ninth Prince-elector as Archbannerbearer during the [[Nine Years' War]].\n\nIn the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], the electoral dignities of the Palatinate and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] were merged, approved by the 1779 [[Treaty of Teschen]]. The [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 entailed the dissolution of the Cologne and Trier Prince-archbishoprics, the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz and German Archchancellor received\u2014as compensation for his lost territory occupied by [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]]\u2014the newly established [[Principality of Regensburg]]. In turn, four secular princes were elevated to prince-electors:\n* the [[Electorate of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]]\n* the [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n* the [[Electorate of Baden|Margrave of Baden]]\n* the [[Electorate of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]]\nThese changes however had little effect, as with the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] as Holy Roman Emperor the Empire was dissolved only three years later.\n\n=== Princes ===\nThe college of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Princes]] (''Reichsf\u00fcrstenrat'' or ''F\u00fcrstenbank'') incorporated the [[Imperial Count]]s as well as [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] lords, [[Prince-Bishop]]s and [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbots]]. Strong in members, though often discordant, the second college tried to preserve its interests against the dominance of the Prince-electors.\n\nThe House of Princes was again subdivided into an ecclesiastical and a secular bench. Remarkably, the ecclesiastical bench was headed by the\u2014secular\u2014[[Archduchy of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] and the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] duke of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] (held by [[Habsburg Spain]] from 1556). As the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] had failed to assume the leadership of the secular bench, they received the guidance over the ecclesiastical princes instead. The first ecclesiastical prince was the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as ''[[Primas Germaniae]]''; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besan\u00e7on|Prince-Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on]], though officially a member until the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], did not attend the Diet's meetings.\n\nThe ecclesiastical bench also comprised the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] and ''Deutschmeister'' of the [[Teutonic Knights]], as well as the [[Prior|Grand Prior]] of the Monastic State of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at [[Heitersheim]]. The [[Bishopric of L\u00fcbeck|Prince-Bishopric of L\u00fcbeck]] remained an ecclesiastical member even after it had turned [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]], ruled by [[diocesan administrator]]s from the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|House of Holstein-Gottorp]] from 1586. The [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]], according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia was under alternating rule of a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] bishop and a Lutheran bishop from the [[House of Hanover]].\n\nEach member of the Princes' College held either a single vote (''Virilstimme'') or a collective vote (''Kuriatstimme''). Due to the Princes, their single vote from 1582 strictly depended on their immediate fiefs; this principle led to an accumulation of votes, when one ruler held several territories in [[personal union]]. Counts and Lords only were entitled to collective votes, they therefore formed separate colleges like the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]] and mergers within the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian]], the [[Franconian Circle|Franconian]] and the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]]s. Likewise, on the ecclesiastical bench, the Imperial abbots joined a Swabian or [[Rhine|Rhenish]] college.\n\nIn the German Mediatisation of 1803, numerous ecclesiastical territories were annexed by secular estates. A reform of the Princes' college was however not carried out until the Empire's dissolution in 1806.\n\n=== Cities ===\nThe college of [[Free imperial city|Imperial Cities]] (''Reichsst\u00e4dtekollegium'') evolved from 1489 onwards, it contributed greatly to the development of the Imperial Diets as a political institution. Nevertheless, the collective vote of the cities initially was of inferior importance until a 1582 [[Recess (Holy Roman Empire)|Recess]] of the [[Diet of Augsburg|Augsburg Diet]]. The college was led by the city council of the actual venue; with the implementation of the Perpetual Diet in 1663, the chair passed to [[Regensburg]].\n\nThe Imperial cities also divided into a Swabian and Rhenish bench. The Swabian cities were led by [[Nuremberg]], [[Augsburg]] and Regensburg, the Rhenish cities by [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]] and [[Frankfurt]].\n\nFor a complete list of members of the Imperial Diet from 1792, near the end of the Empire, see [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]].\n\n== Religious bodies ==\n{{main|Itio in partes}}\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], religious matters could no longer be decided by a majority vote of the colleges. Instead, the Reichstag would separate into Catholic and Protestant bodies, which would discuss the matter separately and then negotiate an agreement with each other, a procedure called the ''[[itio in partes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peace Treaties of Westphalia (October 14/24, 1648)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/87.%20PeaceWestphalia_en.pdf|website=German History in Documents and Images|quote=In religious and all other affairs in which the estates cannot be considered as one body, and when the Catholic estates and those of the Augsburg Confession are divided into two parties, the dispute is to be decided by amicable agreement alone, and neither side is to be bound by a majority vote.}}</ref>  The Catholic body, or ''[[corpus catholicorum]]'', was headed by the Archbishop-Elector of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]].<ref name=\"kalipke\">{{cite book|last=Kalipke|first=Andreas|chapter=The Corpus Evangelicorum|title=The Holy Roman Empire, Reconsidered|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn|pages=228\u2013247|editors=Coy, Marschke, and Sabean}}</ref>\n\nThe Protestant body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]'', was headed by the Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]].  At meetings of the Protestant body, Saxony would introduce each topic of discussion, after which [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] would speak, followed by the remaining states in order of size.  When all the states had spoken, Saxony would weigh the votes and announce a consensus.\n\n[[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony]] converted to Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland, but the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant and retained the directorship of the Protestant body.  When [[Augustus III of Poland|the Elector's son]] also converted to Catholicism, Prussia and Hanover attempted to take over the directorship in 1717\u20131720, but without success.  The Electors of Saxony would head the Protestant body until the end of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=\"kalipke\"/>\n\n== Collection of records ==\nAfter the formation of the new [[German Empire]] in 1871, the Historical Commission of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] started to collect imperial records (''Reichsakten'') and imperial diet records (''Reichstagsakten''). In 1893 the commission published the first volume. At present the years 1524\u20131527 and years up to 1544 are being collected and researched. A volume dealing with the 1532 Diet of Regensburg, including the peace negotiations with the [[Protestants]] in [[Schweinfurt]] and [[Nuremberg]], by [[Rosemarie Aulinger]] of [[Vienna]] was published in 1992.\n\n== Locations of Imperial Diets ==\n:''Note: this list is incomplete''\n{|

Egypt borders [[Libya]] to the west, the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast, and [[Sudan]] to the [[south]]. Egypt has an area of {{convert|1,002,450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} which makes it the 31st largest country in the world. \n\nThe longest straight-line distance in Egypt from north to south is {{convert|1,024|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while that from east to west measures {{convert|1,240|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Egypt has more than {{convert|2,900|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It has an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|263,451|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Governorates==\n{{Main|Governorates of Egypt}}\nEgypt is divided into 28 [[governorate]]s, which include two city-governorates: [[Alexandria]] ([[Alexandria Governorate]]) and [[Cairo]] ([[Cairo Governorate]]). There are nine governorates of [[Lower Egypt]] in the [[Nile Delta]] region, ten of [[Upper Egypt]] along the [[Nile]] river south from Cairo to [[Aswan]] and five frontier governorates covering Sinai and the deserts that lie west and east of the Nile river.\n\n==Natural regions==\n[[File:Egypt Topography.png|thumb|250px|Egypt's topography.]]\nEgypt is predominantly [[desert]]. 35,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> - 3.5% - of the total land area is [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d and permanently settled. Most of the country lies within the wide band of desert that stretches eastwards from Africa's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] across the [[continent]] and into southwest Asia.\n\nEgypt's [[geological]] history has produced four major [[physical regions]]:\n* [[Nile]] Valley and [[Nile Delta]]\n* [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] (from the Nile west to the Libyan border) \n* [[Eastern Desert]] (extends from the Nile Valley all the way to the [[Red Sea]] coast)\n* [[Sinai Peninsula]]\n\nDespite covering only about 5% of the total area of Egypt; the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Nile Delta]] are the most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population.  The Nile valley extends approximately 800&nbsp;km from Aswan to the outskirts of Cairo.  The Nile Valley is known as [[Upper Egypt]], while the Nile Delta region is known as [[Lower Egypt]].  Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of the Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production.  In the past, flooding of the Nile during the summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry.  Since construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], agriculture in the Nile valley depends on [[irrigation]].  The Nile delta consists of flat, low-lying areas.  Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture.  Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pyramid Builders of Ancient Egypt: A Modern Investigation of Pharaoh's Workforce |author=Rosalie, David |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |chapter=The Geography and Historical Background |pages=14}}</ref>\n\n\nThe much shorter Atbarah River, which also originates in Ethiopia, joins the main Nile north of Khartoum between the fifth and sixth [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataracts]] (areas of steep rapids) and provides about 14% of the Nile's waters in Egypt. During the low-water season, which runs from January to June, the Atbarah shrinks to a number of pools. But, in late-summer, when torrential rains fall on the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the Atbarah provides 22% of the Nile's flow.\n\nThe Blue Nile has a similar pattern. It contributes 17% of the Nile's waters in the low-water season and 68% during the high-water season. In contrast, the White Nile provides only 10% of the Nile's waters during the high-water season but contributes more than 80% during the low-water period. Thus, before the [[Aswan High Dam]] was completed in 1971, the White Nile watered the Egyptian stretch of the river throughout the year, whereas the Blue Nile, carrying seasonal rain from Ethiopia, caused the Nile to overflow its banks and deposit a layer of fertile mud over adjacent fields. The great flood of the main Nile usually occurred in Egypt during August, September, and October, but it sometimes began as early as June at [[Aswan]] and often did not completely wane until January.\n\nThe Nile enters Egypt a few kilometers north of [[Wadi Halfa]], a Sudanese town that was completely rebuilt on high ground when its original site was submerged in the [[reservoir]] created by the Aswan High Dam. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as [[Lake Nasser]], which extends southwards from the dam for 320&nbsp;km to the border and for an additional 158&nbsp;km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through [[Lower Nubia]] (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow [[canyon]] between the [[cliffs]] of [[sandstone]] and [[granite]] created by the flow of the river over many centuries.\n\nBelow Aswan the cultivated [[floodplain]] strip widens to as much as twenty km. North of Isna (160&nbsp;km north of Aswan), the plateau on both sides of the valley rises to as much as 550 m above sea level; at Qina (some 90&nbsp;km north of Isna) the 300-m limestone cliffs force the Nile to change course towards the southwest for about 60&nbsp;km before it turns northwest for about 160&nbsp;km to Asyut. Northward from Asyut, the [[escarpment]]s on both sides diminish, and the valley widens to a maximum of 22&nbsp;km.\n\nAt Cairo, the Nile spreads out over what was once a broad [[estuary]], subsequently filled by silt deposits to form what is now a fertile, fan-shaped [[River delta|delta]] some 250&nbsp;km wide at its seaward extremity and extending about 160&nbsp;km from north to south. The Nile Delta covers approximately 22,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (roughly equivalent in area to that of [[Massachusetts]]). According to historical accounts from the first century AD, seven branches of the Nile once ran through the delta. According to later accounts, the Nile had, by around the twelfth century, just six branches.\n\nSince then, nature and man have closed all but two main outlets: the east branch, [[Damietta]] (also seen as Dumyat; 240&nbsp;km long), and the west branch, [[Rosetta]] (235&nbsp;km long). Both outlets are named after the [[port]]s located at their respective mouths. A network of [[drainage]] and [[irrigation]] [[canals]] supplements these remaining outlets. In the north, near the coast, the Nile delta embraces a series of [[salt marshes]] and [[lake]]s, the most notable among which are [[Idku]], [[Al Burullus]], and [[Manzilah]].\n\nThe fertility and productivity of the land adjacent to the Nile depends largely on the [[silt]] deposited by floodwaters. [[Archaeological]] research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The timing and the amount of annual flow were always unpredictable. Measurements of annual flows as low as 1.2 billion m<sup>3</sup> and as high as 4.25 billion m<sup>3</sup> have been recorded. For centuries Egyptians attempted to predict and take advantage of these flows and thereby moderate the severity of floods.\n\nThe construction of [[dams]] on the Nile, particularly the Aswan High Dam, transformed the mighty river into a large and predictable [[irrigation]] [[ditch]]. Lake Nasser, the world's largest artificial lake, has enabled planned use of the Nile regardless of the amount of rainfall in [[Central Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's [[fertility]], which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the [[arable land]] but also on the materials left by the water.\n\nResearchers have estimated that beneficial silt deposits in the valley began about 10,000 years ago. The average annual deposit of arable soil through the course of the river valley amounted to some nine metres. Analysis of the flow revealed that 10.7 million tons of solid matter passed Cairo each year.\n\nToday the Aswan High Dam obstructs most of this sediment, now retained in Lake Nasser. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing [[soil salinity]] in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in [[Upper Egypt]], and the erosion of the [[alluvial fan]] along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n===Eastern Desert===\n[[File:Dust storms off Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A large plume of Saharan Desert dust (light brownish pixels) blown across Libya and Egypt northward over the Mediterranean Sea toward the Middle East, on February 2, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Eastern Desert}}\n\nThe topographic features of the desert region east of the Nile differ from those to the west of the Nile. The Eastern Desert is relatively mountainous. The elevation rises abruptly from the Nile, and a downward-sloping plateau of sand gives way within 100&nbsp;km to arid, defoliated, rocky hills running north and south between the Sudan border and the Delta. The hills reach elevations of more than 1,900 m.\n\nThe region's most prominent feature is the easterly chain of rugged mountains, the [[Red Sea Hills]], which extend from the Nile Valley eastward to the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the Red Sea. This elevated region has a natural drainage pattern that rarely functions because of insufficient rainfall. It also has a complex of irregular, sharply cut [[wadis]] that extend westward toward the Nile. The desert environment extends all the way to the Red Sea coast.\n\n===Sinai Peninsula===\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Mount Catherine]] in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], Egypt's highest point.]]\nThe [[Sinai Peninsula]] is a triangular-shaped [[peninsula]], about 61,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area (slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]). Similar to the desert, the peninsula contains mountains in its southern sector that are a geological extension of the Red Sea Hills, the low range along the Red Sea coast that includes [[Mount Catherine]] (Jabal Katrinah), the country's highest point, at 2,642 m above sea-level. The Red Sea may have been named after these mountains, which are red.\n\nThe southern side of the peninsula has a sharp escarpment that subsides after a narrow coastal shelf that slopes into the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. The elevation of Sinai's southern rim is about 1,000 m. Moving northward, the elevation of this [[limestone]] plateau decreases. The northern third of Sinai is a flat, sandy coastal plain, which extends from the Suez Canal into the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]].\n\nBefore the Israeli military occupied Sinai during the June 1967 War (Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Six-Day War), a single Egyptian governorate administered the whole peninsula. By 1982 after all of Sinai was returned to Egypt, the central government divided the peninsula into two governorates. North Sinai has its capital at Al Arish and the South Sinai has its capital in Artt Turkishy.\n\nThe abundance of life in the Sinai Peninsula may not be immediately apparent. This again has its roots in the way in which the animals of the desert have adapted to life here. Many species, mammals especially, but also reptiles and even birds such as owls, are nocturnal. They spend the daylight hours in the relative cool of burrows, under boulders or in crevices and cracks in the rock. Many of these creatures will only be apparent from their tracks and trails or from a fleeting glimpse of a diminutive gerbil, or zig-zigging hare, in the car headlights at night. Even those animals that do brave the heat of the day are normally only active in the early morning or evening.\n\n==Urban and rural areas==\nIn the 1971 census, 57 percent of Egypt's population was counted as rural, including those residing in agricultural areas in the Nile Valley and Delta, as well as the much smaller number of persons living in desert areas.  Rural areas differ from the urban in terms of poverty, fertility rates, and other social factors.  Agriculture is a key component of the economy in rural areas, though some people are employed in the tourist industry or other non-farm occupations.  In 1992, the percentage of Egypt's population employed in agriculture was 33 percent.

Egypt borders [[Libya]] to the west, the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast, and [[Sudan]] to the [[south]]. Egypt has an area of {{convert|1,002,450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} which makes it the 31st largest country in the world. \n\nThe longest straight-line distance in Egypt from north to south is {{convert|1,024|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while that from east to west measures {{convert|1,240|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Egypt has more than {{convert|2,900|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It has an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|263,451|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Governorates==\n{{Main|Governorates of Egypt}}\nEgypt is divided into 28 [[governorate]]s, which include two city-governorates: [[Alexandria]] ([[Alexandria Governorate]]) and [[Cairo]] ([[Cairo Governorate]]). There are nine governorates of [[Lower Egypt]] in the [[Nile Delta]] region, ten of [[Upper Egypt]] along the [[Nile]] river south from Cairo to [[Aswan]] and five frontier governorates covering Sinai and the deserts that lie west and east of the Nile river.\n\n==Natural regions==\n[[File:Egypt Topography.png|thumb|250px|Egypt's topography.]]\nEgypt is predominantly [[desert]]. 35,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> - 3.5% - of the total land area is [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d and permanently settled. Most of the country lies within the wide band of desert that stretches eastwards from Africa's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] across the [[continent]] and into southwest Asia.\n\nEgypt's [[geological]] history has produced four major [[physical regions]]:\n* [[Nile]] Valley and [[Nile Delta]]\n* [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] (from the Nile west to the Libyan border) \n* [[Eastern Desert]] (extends from the Nile Valley all the way to the [[Red Sea]] coast)\n* [[Sinai Peninsula]]\n\nDespite covering only about 5% of the total area of Egypt; the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Nile Delta]] are the most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population.  The Nile valley extends approximately 800&nbsp;km from Aswan to the outskirts of Cairo.  The Nile Valley is known as [[Upper Egypt]], while the Nile Delta region is known as [[Lower Egypt]].  Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of the Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production.  In the past, flooding of the Nile during the summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry.  Since construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], agriculture in the Nile valley depends on [[irrigation]].  The Nile delta consists of flat, low-lying areas.  Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture.  Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pyramid Builders of Ancient Egypt: A Modern Investigation of Pharaoh's Workforce |author=Rosalie, David |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |chapter=The Geography and Historical Background |pages=14}}</ref>\n\n===Nile Valley and Delta===\n[[File:Nile composite NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nile delta, and the entire course of the Nile]]\n{{Main|Nile|Nile Delta}}\nThe Nile Valley and Delta, the most extensive [[oasis]] on earth, was created by the world's longest river and its seemingly inexhaustible sources. Without the [[topographic]] [[Stream channel|channel]] that permits the Nile to flow across the [[Sahara]], Egypt would be entirely desert. The length within Egypt of the River Nile in its northwards course from three central African sources \u2013 the [[White Nile]], the [[Blue Nile]], and the [[Atbara]] \u2013 totals some 1,600&nbsp;km.\n\nThe White Nile, which begins at [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Uganda]], supplies about 28% of the Nile's Egyptian waters. In its course from Lake Victoria to [[Juba]] in [[South Sudan]], the White Nile's channel drops more than 600 m. In its 1,600-km course from Juba to [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]]'s capital, the river descends just 75 m. In South Sudan, the White Nile passes through the [[Sudd]], a wide, flat plain covered with [[swamp]] [[vegetation]] and slows almost to the point of [[Water stagnation|stagnation]].\n\nThe Blue Nile, which originates at [[Lake Tana]] in [[Ethiopia]], provides on average some 58% of the Nile's Egyptian waters. This river has a steeper gradient and therefore  flows more swiftly than the White Nile, which it joins at Khartoum. Unlike the White Nile, the Blue Nile carries a considerable amount of [[sediment]]. For several kilometres north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly [[mud]]dy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer.\n\nThe much shorter Atbarah River, which also originates in Ethiopia, joins the main Nile north of Khartoum between the fifth and sixth [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataracts]] (areas of steep rapids) and provides about 14% of the Nile's waters in Egypt. During the low-water season, which runs from January to June, the Atbarah shrinks to a number of pools. But, in late-summer, when torrential rains fall on the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the Atbarah provides 22% of the Nile's flow.\n\nThe Blue Nile has a similar pattern. It contributes 17% of the Nile's waters in the low-water season and 68% during the high-water season. In contrast, the White Nile provides only 10% of the Nile's waters during the high-water season but contributes more than 80% during the low-water period. Thus, before the [[Aswan High Dam]] was completed in 1971, the White Nile watered the Egyptian stretch of the river throughout the year, whereas the Blue Nile, carrying seasonal rain from Ethiopia, caused the Nile to overflow its banks and deposit a layer of fertile mud over adjacent fields. The great flood of the main Nile usually occurred in Egypt during August, September, and October, but it sometimes began as early as June at [[Aswan]] and often did not completely wane until January.\n\nThe Nile enters Egypt a few kilometers north of [[Wadi Halfa]], a Sudanese town that was completely rebuilt on high ground when its original site was submerged in the [[reservoir]] created by the Aswan High Dam. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as [[Lake Nasser]], which extends southwards from the dam for 320&nbsp;km to the border and for an additional 158&nbsp;km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through [[Lower Nubia]] (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow [[canyon]] between the [[cliffs]] of [[sandstone]] and [[granite]] created by the flow of the river over many centuries.\n\nBelow Aswan the cultivated [[floodplain]] strip widens to as much as twenty km. North of Isna (160&nbsp;km north of Aswan), the plateau on both sides of the valley rises to as much as 550 m above sea level; at Qina (some 90&nbsp;km north of Isna) the 300-m limestone cliffs force the Nile to change course towards the southwest for about 60&nbsp;km before it turns northwest for about 160&nbsp;km to Asyut. Northward from Asyut, the [[escarpment]]s on both sides diminish, and the valley widens to a maximum of 22&nbsp;km.\n\nAt Cairo, the Nile spreads out over what was once a broad [[estuary]], subsequently filled by silt deposits to form what is now a fertile, fan-shaped [[River delta|delta]] some 250&nbsp;km wide at its seaward extremity and extending about 160&nbsp;km from north to south. The Nile Delta covers approximately 22,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (roughly equivalent in area to that of [[Massachusetts]]). According to historical accounts from the first century AD, seven branches of the Nile once ran through the delta. According to later accounts, the Nile had, by around the twelfth century, just six branches.\n\nSince then, nature and man have closed all but two main outlets: the east branch, [[Damietta]] (also seen as Dumyat; 240&nbsp;km long), and the west branch, [[Rosetta]] (235&nbsp;km long). Both outlets are named after the [[port]]s located at their respective mouths. A network of [[drainage]] and [[irrigation]] [[canals]] supplements these remaining outlets. In the north, near the coast, the Nile delta embraces a series of [[salt marshes]] and [[lake]]s, the most notable among which are [[Idku]], [[Al Burullus]], and [[Manzilah]].\n\nThe fertility and productivity of the land adjacent to the Nile depends largely on the [[silt]] deposited by floodwaters. [[Archaeological]] research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The timing and the amount of annual flow were always unpredictable. Measurements of annual flows as low as 1.2 billion m<sup>3</sup> and as high as 4.25 billion m<sup>3</sup> have been recorded. For centuries Egyptians attempted to predict and take advantage of these flows and thereby moderate the severity of floods.\n\nThe construction of [[dams]] on the Nile, particularly the Aswan High Dam, transformed the mighty river into a large and predictable [[irrigation]] [[ditch]]. Lake Nasser, the world's largest artificial lake, has enabled planned use of the Nile regardless of the amount of rainfall in [[Central Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's [[fertility]], which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the [[arable land]] but also on the materials left by the water.\n\nResearchers have estimated that beneficial silt deposits in the valley began about 10,000 years ago. The average annual deposit of arable soil through the course of the river valley amounted to some nine metres. Analysis of the flow revealed that 10.7 million tons of solid matter passed Cairo each year.\n\nToday the Aswan High Dam obstructs most of this sediment, now retained in Lake Nasser. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing [[soil salinity]] in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in [[Upper Egypt]], and the erosion of the [[alluvial fan]] along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n===Western Desert===\n{{Main|Western Desert (Egypt)}}\nThe Western Desert covers an area of some 700,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, thereby  accounting for around two-thirds of Egypt's total land area. This immense desert to the west of the Nile spans the area from the Mediterranean Sea southwards to the Sudanese border. The desert's [[Jilf al Kabir Plateau]], at a mean altitude of  some 1000 m, constitutes an exception to the uninterrupted territory of basement rocks covered by layers of horizontally bedded sediments forming a massive plain or low plateau. The [[Great Sand Sea]] lies within the desert's plain and extends from the [[Siwa Oasis]] to [[Jilf al Kabir]]. [[Escarpment]]s (ridges) and deep depressions (basins) exist in several parts of the Western Desert, and no rivers or streams drain into or out of the area.\n\nThe government has considered the Western Desert a frontier region and has divided it into two governorates at about the twenty-eighth parallel: [[Matruh Governorate|Matruh]] to the north and New Valley (Al Wadi al Jadid) to the south. There are seven important depressions in the Western Desert, and all are considered oases except the largest, [[Qattara]], the water of which is salty.  The [[Qattara Depression]], which includes the country's lowest point, encompasses {{convert|19605|km2|mi2|0|sp=us}}, which is similar to the size of [[Lake Ontario]].  It is largely below sea level and is {{convert|133|m|ft|0|sp=us}} below sea level at the lowest. [[Badlands]], salt marshes, and salt lakes cover the sparsely inhabited Qattara Depression.\n\nLimited [[agricultural]] production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent [[Community|settlements]] are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local [[groundwater]]. The Siwah Oasis, close to the Libyan border and west of Qattara, is isolated from the rest of Egypt but has sustained life since ancient times. The Siwa's cliff-hung Temple of Amun was renowned for its oracles for more than 1,000 years. [[Herodotus]] and [[Alexander the Great]] were among the many illustrious people who visited the temple in the pre-Christian era.\n\nThe other major [[oases]] form a [[topographic]] chain of [[Depression (geology)|basin]]s extending from the [[Faiyum Oasis]] (sometimes called the Fayyum Depression) which lies {{convert|60|km|mi|0|sp=us}} southwest of [[Cairo]], south to the [[Bahariya]], [[Farafra|Farafirah]], and [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhilah]] oases before reaching the country's largest oasis, [[Kharga|Kharijah]]. A brackish lake, [[Birket Qarun]], at the northern reaches of Al Fayyum Oasis, drained into the Nile in ancient times. For centuries sweet water [[artesian wells]] in the Fayyum Oasis have permitted extensive [[Tillage|cultivation]] in an irrigated area that extends over {{convert|1800|km2|mi2|0|sp=us}}.\n\n===Eastern Desert===\n[[File:Dust storms off Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A large plume of Saharan Desert dust (light brownish pixels) blown across Libya and Egypt northward over the Mediterranean Sea toward the Middle East, on February 2, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Eastern Desert}}\n\nThe topographic features of the desert region east of the Nile differ from those to the west of the Nile. The Eastern Desert is relatively mountainous. The elevation rises abruptly from the Nile, and a downward-sloping plateau of sand gives way within 100&nbsp;km to arid, defoliated, rocky hills running north and south between the Sudan border and the Delta. The hills reach elevations of more than 1,900 m.\n\nThe region's most prominent feature is the easterly chain of rugged mountains, the [[Red Sea Hills]], which extend from the Nile Valley eastward to the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the Red Sea. This elevated region has a natural drainage pattern that rarely functions because of insufficient rainfall. It also has a complex of irregular, sharply cut [[wadis]] that extend westward toward the Nile. The desert environment extends all the way to the Red Sea coast.\n\n===Sinai Peninsula===\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Mount Catherine]] in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], Egypt's highest point.]]\nThe [[Sinai Peninsula]] is a triangular-shaped [[peninsula]], about 61,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area (slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]). Similar to the desert, the peninsula contains mountains in its southern sector that are a geological extension of the Red Sea Hills, the low range along the Red Sea coast that includes [[Mount Catherine]] (Jabal Katrinah), the country's highest point, at 2,642 m above sea-level. The Red Sea may have been named after these mountains, which are red.\n\nThe southern side of the peninsula has a sharp escarpment that subsides after a narrow coastal shelf that slopes into the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. The elevation of Sinai's southern rim is about 1,000 m. Moving northward, the elevation of this [[limestone]] plateau decreases. The northern third of Sinai is a flat, sandy coastal plain, which extends from the Suez Canal into the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]].\n\nBefore the Israeli military occupied Sinai during the June 1967 War (Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Six-Day War), a single Egyptian governorate administered the whole peninsula. By 1982 after all of Sinai was returned to Egypt, the central government divided the peninsula into two governorates. North Sinai has its capital at Al Arish and the South Sinai has its capital in Artt Turkishy.\n\nThe abundance of life in the Sinai Peninsula may not be immediately apparent. This again has its roots in the way in which the animals of the desert have adapted to life here. Many species, mammals especially, but also reptiles and even birds such as owls, are nocturnal. They spend the daylight hours in the relative cool of burrows, under boulders or in crevices and cracks in the rock. Many of these creatures will only be apparent from their tracks and trails or from a fleeting glimpse of a diminutive gerbil, or zig-zigging hare, in the car headlights at night. Even those animals that do brave the heat of the day are normally only active in the early morning or evening.\n\n==Urban and rural areas==\nIn the 1971 census, 57 percent of Egypt's population was counted as rural, including those residing in agricultural areas in the Nile Valley and Delta, as well as the much smaller number of persons living in desert areas.  Rural areas differ from the urban in terms of poverty, fertility rates, and other social factors.  Agriculture is a key component of the economy in rural areas, though some people are employed in the tourist industry or other non-farm occupations.  In 1992, the percentage of Egypt's population employed in agriculture was 33 percent.  The agricultural industry is dependent on [[irrigation]] from the Nile river.<ref>{{cite book |title=Directions of Change in Rural Egypt |author=Hopkins, Nicholas and Kirsten Westergaard |year=1998 |publisher=American University in Cairo |pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==Extreme points==\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Egypt]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point \u2013 unnamed headland immediately north-west of [[Sidi Barrani]], [[Matruh Governorate]]\n* Easternmost point \u2013 [[Ras Hadarba]] (Cape Elba), [[Red Sea Governorate]]*\n* Southernmost point - [[Jabal Bartazuga]] on the Sudanese border, [[Red Sea Governorate]] **\n* Westernmost point - unnamed point on the border with [[Libya]] immediately east of the ruin of [[Qasr al Qarn]] in Libya, [[Matruh Governorate]]\n* ''* Ras Hadarba lies within the [[Hala'ib triangle]] which is claimed by [[Sudan]] but occupied by Egypt.
