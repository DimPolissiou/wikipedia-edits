He wrote prolifically into the 1890s, after which his output declined, in part due to struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. At times destitute, he spent periods in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] and psychiatric institutions. After he died in 1922 following a cerebral haemorrhage, Lawson became the first Australian writer to be granted a [[state funeral]].\n\nHe was the son of the poet, publisher and feminist [[Louisa Lawson]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHenry Lawson was born 17 June 1867 in a town on the [[Grenfell, New South Wales|Grenfell goldfields]] of [[New South Wales]]. His father was Niels Hertzberg Larsen, a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born miner.  Niels Larsen went to sea at 21 and arrived in [[Melbourne]] in 1855 to join the gold rush, along with partner [[William Henry John Slee]].<ref name=ADB/> Lawson's parents met at the goldfields of Pipeclay (now Eurunderee, [[Gloucester County, New South Wales]]). Niels and [[Louisa Lawson|Louisa Albury]] (1848\u20131920) married on 7 July 1866 when he was 32 and she 18. On Henry's birth, the family surname was [[Anglicised]] and Niels became Peter Lawson. The newly married couple were to have an unhappy marriage.  Louisa, after family-raising, took a significant part in women's movements, and edited a women's paper called ''[[The Dawn (feminist magazine)|The Dawn]]'' (published May 1888 to July 1905). She also published her son's first volume, and around 1904 brought out a volume of her own, ''Dert and Do'', a simple story of 18,000 words. In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, ''The Lonely Crossing and other Poems''. Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days.<ref name=DAB>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogL.html#lawson2|title=Lawson, Henry (1867 - 1922) |accessdate=2009-07-17 |author=Percival Serle |work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |publisher=[[Angus and Robertson]] |year=1949 |author-link=Percival Serle }}</ref>  Peter Lawson's grave (with headstone) is in the little private cemetery at [[Hartley Vale, New South Wales|Hartley Vale]], New South Wales, a few minutes' walk behind what was Collitt's Inn.\n\nLawson attended school at Eurunderee from 2 October 1876 but suffered an ear infection at around this time. It left him with partial deafness and by the age of fourteen he had lost his hearing entirely. However, his master John Tierney was kind and did all he could for Lawson, who was quite shy.<ref name=DAB/> Lawson later attended a [[Catholic]] school at [[Mudgee]], New South Wales around 8&nbsp;km away; the master there, Mr Kevan, would teach Lawson about poetry. Lawson was a keen reader of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[Frederick Marryat|Marryat]] and Australian novels such as [[Marcus Clarke]]'s ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'' (1874) and [[Rolf Boldrewood]]'s ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' (1882); an aunt had also given him a volume by [[Bret Harte]]. Reading became a major source of his education because, due to his deafness, he had trouble learning in the classroom.\n\nIn 1883, after working on building jobs with his father in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], Lawson joined his mother in Sydney at her request. Louisa was then living with Henry's sister and brother. At this time, Lawson was working during the day and studying at night for his matriculation in the hopes of receiving a university education. However, he failed his exams. At around 20 years of age Lawson went to the eye and ear hospital in [[Melbourne]] but nothing could be done for his deafness.<ref name=DAB/>\n\nIn 1890 he began a relationship with [[Mary Gilmore]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gilmore-dame-mary-jean-6391|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=W.

This marked the beginning of a 20-year friendship between Mrs Byers and Lawson. Despite his position as the most celebrated Australian writer of the time, Lawson was deeply depressed and perpetually poor. He lacked money due to unfortunate royalty deals with publishers. His ex-wife repeatedly reported him for non-payment of child maintenance, resulting in gaol terms.

Long separated from her husband and elderly, Mrs Byers was, at the time she met Lawson, a woman of independent means looking forward to retirement. Byers regarded Lawson as Australia's greatest living poet, and hoped to sustain him well enough to keep him writing. She negotiated on his behalf with publishers, helped to arrange contact with his children, contacted friends and supporters to help him financially, and assisted and nursed him through his mental and alcohol problems.

He wrote prolifically into the 1890s, after which his output declined, in part due to struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. At times destitute, he spent periods in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] and psychiatric institutions. After he died in 1922 following a cerebral haemorrhage, Lawson became the first Australian writer to be granted a [[state funeral]].\n\nHe was the son of the poet, publisher and feminist [[Louisa Lawson]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHenry Lawson was born 17 June 1867 in a town on the [[Grenfell, New South Wales|Grenfell goldfields]] of [[New South Wales]]. His father was Niels Hertzberg Larsen, a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born miner.  Niels Larsen went to sea at 21 and arrived in [[Melbourne]] in 1855 to join the gold rush, along with partner [[William Henry John Slee]].<ref name=ADB/> Lawson's parents met at the goldfields of Pipeclay (now Eurunderee, [[Gloucester County, New South Wales]]). Niels and [[Louisa Lawson|Louisa Albury]] (1848\u20131920) married on 7 July 1866 when he was 32 and she 18. On Henry's birth, the family surname was [[Anglicised]] and Niels became Peter Lawson. The newly married couple were to have an unhappy marriage.  Louisa, after family-raising, took a significant part in women's movements, and edited a women's paper called ''[[The Dawn (feminist magazine)|The Dawn]]'' (published May 1888 to July 1905). She also published her son's first volume, and around 1904 brought out a volume of her own, ''Dert and Do'', a simple story of 18,000 words. In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, ''The Lonely Crossing and other Poems''. Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days.<ref name=DAB>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogL.html#lawson2|title=Lawson, Henry (1867 - 1922) |accessdate=2009-07-17 |author=Percival Serle |work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |publisher=[[Angus and Robertson]] |year=1949 |author-link=Percival Serle }}</ref>  Peter Lawson's grave (with headstone) is in the little private cemetery at [[Hartley Vale, New South Wales|Hartley Vale]], New South Wales, a few minutes' walk behind what was Collitt's Inn.\n\nLawson attended school at Eurunderee from 2 October 1876 but suffered an ear infection at around this time. It left him with partial deafness and by the age of fourteen he had lost his hearing entirely. However, his master John Tierney was kind and did all he could for Lawson, who was quite shy.<ref name=DAB/> Lawson later attended a [[Catholic]] school at [[Mudgee]], New South Wales around 8&nbsp;km away; the master there, Mr Kevan, would teach Lawson about poetry. Lawson was a keen reader of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[Frederick Marryat|Marryat]] and Australian novels such as [[Marcus Clarke]]'s ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'' (1874) and [[Rolf Boldrewood]]'s ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' (1882); an aunt had also given him a volume by [[Bret Harte]]. Reading became a major source of his education because, due to his deafness, he had trouble learning in the classroom.\n\nIn 1883, after working on building jobs with his father in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], Lawson joined his mother in Sydney at her request. Louisa was then living with Henry's sister and brother. At this time, Lawson was working during the day and studying at night for his matriculation in the hopes of receiving a university education. However, he failed his exams. At around 20 years of age Lawson went to the eye and ear hospital in [[Melbourne]] but nothing could be done for his deafness.<ref name=DAB/>\n\nIn 1890 he began a relationship with [[Mary Gilmore]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gilmore-dame-mary-jean-6391|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=W.

This marked the beginning of a 20-year friendship between Mrs Byers and Lawson. Despite his position as the most celebrated Australian writer of the time, Lawson was deeply depressed and perpetually poor. He lacked money due to unfortunate royalty deals with publishers. His ex-wife repeatedly reported him for non-payment of child maintenance, resulting in gaol terms.

Long separated from her husband and elderly, Mrs Byers was, at the time she met Lawson, a woman of independent means looking forward to retirement. Byers regarded Lawson as Australia's greatest living poet, and hoped to sustain him well enough to keep him writing. She negotiated on his behalf with publishers, helped to arrange contact with his children, contacted friends and supporters to help him financially, and assisted and nursed him through his mental and alcohol problems.

He is best known for his 1874 novel ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'', widely regarded as a classic work about [[convicts in Australia|convictism in Australia]], that has been adapted into many plays and films.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Background and early life ===\nMarcus Clarke was born in 11 Leonard Place [[Kensington]], London, the only son of London Barrister William Hislop Clarke and Amelia Elizabeth Matthews Clarke, he was the nephew of Col Clarke, a [[Governor of Western Australia]] and grandson of a retired military medical officer of Irish descent. He was born with his left arm at least two inches shorter than the right, though he later became an accomplished diver in his days at [[Highgate School]].<ref name=White>{{cite book |author1=White, Norman |title=Hopkins: a literary biography |publication-date=1992 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York: [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-812099-5 }}</ref>{{rp|30}} In 1862, father William was sent to Northumberland House suffering a mental breakdown and died there a year later. Marcus Clarke was educated at Highgate School, where his classmates included [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. At Highgate, Clarke attracted Hopkins' attention primarily due to his eloquence, leading Hopkins to describe him as a \"kaleidoscopic, parti-coloured, harlequinesque, thaumatropic Being\".<ref name=White/>{{rp|30}} At age 17 he emigrated to Australia, where his uncle, James Langton Clarke, was a county court judge. Writing from his journey to Australia, he sent Hopkins a letter describing a sunset he had witnessed; this letter probably figured as partial inspiration for Hopkins' poem \"A Vision of the Mermaids\".<ref name=White/>{{rp|31}} He was at first a clerk in the [[Bank of Australia]], but showed no business ability, and soon proceeded to learn farming at a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] on the [[Wimmera River]], Victoria.<ref name=AuDB>{{cite AuDB |id2=clarke-marcus-andrew-3225|title=Clarke, Marcus Andrew (1846\u20131881)|year=1969|accessdate=28 December 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Writing career ===\nHe was already writing stories for the ''Australian Magazine'', when in 1867 he joined the staff of ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' in [[Melbourne]] through the introduction of Dr. Robert Lewins. He was noted for his vivid descriptions of Melbourne's street scenes and city types, including the \"low life\" of opium dens, brothels and gambling houses. He always claimed he was interested in the \"parti-coloured, patch-worked garment of life\".<ref name=Hergenhan>{{Cite journal|last=Hergenhan|first=Laurie|date=Winter 2010|title=A New Biography of Marcus Clarke |url=https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/SL_Winter_2010_lr.pdf|journal=SL Winter 2010|volume=3|issue=2|pages=24}}</ref>{{rp|24}} He briefly visited [[Tasmania]] in 1870 at the request of ''The Argus'' to experience at first hand the settings of articles he was writing on the [[Convicts in Australia|convict period]]. ''Old Stories Retold'' began to appear in ''The Australasian'' from February. The following month his great novel ''His Natural Life'' (later called ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'') commenced serialisation in the ''Australasian Journal''. He also became secretary (1872) to the trustees of the [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] and, later (1876), sub (assistant) librarian. In 1868 he founded the [[Yorick Club (Melbourne)|Yorick Club]], which soon numbered among its members the chief Australian [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]].<ref name=AuDB/>\n\nThe most famous of his books is ''For the Term of His Natural Life'' (Melbourne, 1874), a powerful tale of an Australian [[penal]] settlement, which Marcus Clarke originally referred to as \"His Unnatural Life.\"<ref name=Hergenhan/>{{rp|22\u201324}} One critic has claimed that Clarke's novel is \"the book that more than any other, has defined our perception of the Australian convict experience.\"<ref name=Hergenhan/>{{rp|24}} He also wrote ''The Peripatetic Philosopher'' (1869), a series of amusing papers reprinted from ''The Australasian''; ''Long Odds'' (London, 1870), a novel; and numerous comedies and pantomimes, the best of which was ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' ([[Theatre Royal, Melbourne]]; Christmas, 1873). In 1869 he married the actress Marian Dunn, with whom he had six children.<ref name=AuDB/>\n\n''For the Term of His Natural Life'' is a \"ripping yarn\", which at times relies on unrealistic coincidences. The story follows the fortunes of Rufus Dawes, a young man [[Penal transportation|transported]] for a theft that he did not commit, from the victim of a mugging\u2014to whom he was actually rendering assistance. The harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to the convicts, some of whom were transported for relatively minor crimes, is clearly conveyed. The conditions experienced by the convicts are graphically described. The novel was based on research by the author as well as a visit to the penal settlement of [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]].<ref name=AuDB/>\n\nClarke was an important literary figure in Australia, and was the centre of an important [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] circle. Among the writers were in contact with him were [[Victor Daley]] and [[George Gordon McCrae]].

He is best known for his 1874 novel ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'', widely regarded as a classic work about [[convicts in Australia|convictism in Australia]], that has been adapted into many plays and films.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Background and early life ===\nMarcus Clarke was born in 11 Leonard Place [[Kensington]], London, the only son of London Barrister William Hislop Clarke and Amelia Elizabeth Matthews Clarke, he was the nephew of Col Clarke, a [[Governor of Western Australia]] and grandson of a retired military medical officer of Irish descent. He was born with his left arm at least two inches shorter than the right, though he later became an accomplished diver in his days at [[Highgate School]].<ref name=White>{{cite book |author1=White, Norman |title=Hopkins: a literary biography |publication-date=1992 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York: [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-812099-5 }}</ref>{{rp|30}} In 1862, father William was sent to Northumberland House suffering a mental breakdown and died there a year later. Marcus Clarke was educated at Highgate School, where his classmates included [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. At Highgate, Clarke attracted Hopkins' attention primarily due to his eloquence, leading Hopkins to describe him as a \"kaleidoscopic, parti-coloured, harlequinesque, thaumatropic Being\".<ref name=White/>{{rp|30}} At age 17 he emigrated to Australia, where his uncle, James Langton Clarke, was a county court judge. Writing from his journey to Australia, he sent Hopkins a letter describing a sunset he had witnessed; this letter probably figured as partial inspiration for Hopkins' poem \"A Vision of the Mermaids\".<ref name=White/>{{rp|31}} He was at first a clerk in the [[Bank of Australia]], but showed no business ability, and soon proceeded to learn farming at a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] on the [[Wimmera River]], Victoria.<ref name=AuDB>{{cite AuDB |id2=clarke-marcus-andrew-3225|title=Clarke, Marcus Andrew (1846\u20131881)|year=1969|accessdate=28 December 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Writing career ===\nHe was already writing stories for the ''Australian Magazine'', when in 1867 he joined the staff of ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' in [[Melbourne]] through the introduction of Dr. Robert Lewins. He was noted for his vivid descriptions of Melbourne's street scenes and city types, including the \"low life\" of opium dens, brothels and gambling houses. He always claimed he was interested in the \"parti-coloured, patch-worked garment of life\".<ref name=Hergenhan>{{Cite journal|last=Hergenhan|first=Laurie|date=Winter 2010|title=A New Biography of Marcus Clarke |url=https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/SL_Winter_2010_lr.pdf|journal=SL Winter 2010|volume=3|issue=2|pages=24}}</ref>{{rp|24}} He briefly visited [[Tasmania]] in 1870 at the request of ''The Argus'' to experience at first hand the settings of articles he was writing on the [[Convicts in Australia|convict period]]. ''Old Stories Retold'' began to appear in ''The Australasian'' from February. The following month his great novel ''His Natural Life'' (later called ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'') commenced serialisation in the ''Australasian Journal''. He also became secretary (1872) to the trustees of the [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] and, later (1876), sub (assistant) librarian. In 1868 he founded the [[Yorick Club (Melbourne)|Yorick Club]], which soon numbered among its members the chief Australian [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]].<ref name=AuDB/>\n\nThe most famous of his books is ''For the Term of His Natural Life'' (Melbourne, 1874), a powerful tale of an Australian [[penal]] settlement, which Marcus Clarke originally referred to as \"His Unnatural Life.\"<ref name=Hergenhan/>{{rp|22\u201324}} One critic has claimed that Clarke's novel is \"the book that more than any other, has defined our perception of the Australian convict experience.\"<ref name=Hergenhan/>{{rp|24}} He also wrote ''The Peripatetic Philosopher'' (1869), a series of amusing papers reprinted from ''The Australasian''; ''Long Odds'' (London, 1870), a novel; and numerous comedies and pantomimes, the best of which was ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' ([[Theatre Royal, Melbourne]]; Christmas, 1873). In 1869 he married the actress Marian Dunn, with whom he had six children.<ref name=AuDB/>\n\n''For the Term of His Natural Life'' is a \"ripping yarn\", which at times relies on unrealistic coincidences. The story follows the fortunes of Rufus Dawes, a young man [[Penal transportation|transported]] for a theft that he did not commit, from the victim of a mugging\u2014to whom he was actually rendering assistance. The harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to the convicts, some of whom were transported for relatively minor crimes, is clearly conveyed. The conditions experienced by the convicts are graphically described. The novel was based on research by the author as well as a visit to the penal settlement of [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]].<ref name=AuDB/>\n\nClarke was an important literary figure in Australia, and was the centre of an important [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] circle.

Stead also became involved with the writer, broker and Marxist political economist [[William J. Blake]] (formerly Wilhelm Blech), with whom she travelled to Spain (leaving at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]]) and to the USA. They married in 1952, once Blake was able to obtain a divorce from his previous wife. It was after his death from stomach cancer in 1968 that she returned to Australia.<ref name=bwcs /> Indeed, Stead only returned to Australia after she was denied the Britannica-Australia prize on the grounds that she had \"ceased to be an Australian.\"\n\nStead wrote 12 novels and several volumes of short stories in her lifetime. She taught \"Workshop in the Novel\" at [[New York University]] in 1943 and 1944, and also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1940s,<ref name=bwcs /> contributing to the ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' biopic and the [[John Ford]] and [[John Wayne]] war movie, ''[[They Were Expendable]]''.<ref name=bwcs /> Her first novel, ''Seven Poor Men of Sydney'' (1934), dealt with the lives of radicals and dockworkers, but she was not a practitioner of [[social realism]]. Stead's best-known novel, titled ''[[The Man Who Loved Children]],'' is largely based on her own childhood, and was first published in 1940. It was not until the poet [[Randall Jarrell]] wrote the introduction for a new American edition in 1965 and her New York publisher convinced her to change the setting from Sydney to Washington<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corkhill|first=Anna|date=Autumn 2018|title=5 Australian Literary Classics|url=|journal=SL Magazine|volume=11|issue=1|pages=8|via=}}</ref>, that the novel began to receive a larger audience.

She was in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the summer of 1949, accompanied by her friend Anne Dooley (n\u00e9e Kelly), a local woman, who was the model for Nellie Cotter, the extraordinary heroine of the book. Anne was no doubt responsible for Stead's reasonable attempt at conveying the local accent. Her letters indicate that she had taken on Tyneside speech and become deeply concerned with the people around her. The American title of the book is ''Dark Places of the Heart''.\n\nStead died in hospital at [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], Sydney, in 1983, aged 80. Her former home in Pacific Street, Watsons Bay, was the first site chosen for the [[Municipality of Woollahra|Woollahra]] Council Plaque Scheme, which was launched in 2014 with the aim of honouring significant people who had lived in the area covered by Woollahra Council.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 2015-9-11, p. 15</ref> A plaque was installed on the footpath outside Stead's former home.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:(1)Writers Walk Circular Quay 031.jpg|thumb|250px|Stead's plaque on the Writers Walk, [[Circular Quay]], Sydney]]\n===Novels===\n\n* ''[[Seven Poor Men of Sydney]]'' (1934)\n* ''[[The Beauties and Furies]]'' (1936)\n* ''[[House of All Nations]]'' (1938)\n* ''[[The Man Who Loved Children]]'' (1940)\n* ''[[For Love Alone (novel)|For Love Alone]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[Letty Fox: Her Luck]]'' (1946)\n* ''[[A Little Tea, a Little Chat]]'' (1948)\n* ''[[The People with the Dogs]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Dark Places of the Heart]]'' (1966) (aka ''Cotters' England'')\n* ''[[The Little Hotel]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Miss Herbert (The Suburban Wife)]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[I'm Dying Laughing: The Humourist]]'' (1986)\n\n===Short stories===\n* ''The Salzburg Tales'' (1934)\n* ''The Puzzleheaded Girl: Four Novellas'' (1965) (containing ''The Puzzleheaded Girl'', ''The Dianas'', ''The Rightangled Creek'' and ''Girl from the Beach'')\n* ''A Christina Stead Reader'' (1978) edited by Jean B.

After showing great skill in his education, he worked his way into [[Canada]] as first a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]], then as a reporter for the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' where he would later meet his future wife Ann Lane, ''n\u00e9e'' Macquire. After settling in Australia with his wife and child, as well as his brother John, he became active in the Australian labour movement, founding the Australian Labour Federation and becoming a prolific journalist for the movement. He authored works covering topics such as [[Labor rights|labour rights]] and [[white nationalism]].\n\nAfter becoming disillusioned with the state of Australian politics following an [[History of the Australian Labor Party|ideological split]] in the labour movement, he and a group of utopian acolytes (among them influential writer and poet [[Mary Gilmore]]) moved to [[Paraguay]] in 1892 to found [[New Australia]], with the intention of building a new society on the foundations of his utopian ideals. Following disagreement with the colony regarding the legality of [[miscegenation]] and [[Drinking culture|alcohol consumption]], he left to found the nearby colony Cosme in May 1894, and later abandoned the project altogether in 1899.\n\nUpon resetting in [[New Zealand]] he continued his journalistic endeavours until his death in August 1917. After his death he was both celebrated as a champion of utopian socialism, and condemned as the arrogant leader of a failed new society. Due to his radical politics and his extensive journalistic career, he remains a controversial figure in Australian history.\n\n==Early life==\nLane was born in [[Bristol]], England on 6 September 1861, as the eldest son of James Lane, an [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] landscape gardener, and his English wife Caroline, ''n\u00e9e'' Hall.<ref name=ADB/> Lane was born with a debilitating [[clubfoot]], a condition that would be partially corrected in [[Montreal]] later in life, leaving him with a limp. Lane's father James was a drunkard who when Lane was born was earning a miserable wage, but later he improved his circumstances and became an employer.\n\nThe young Lane was educated at [[Bristol Grammar School]] and demonstrated himself as a gifted student, but he was sent early to work as an office boy. Lane's mother died when he was 14 years of age, and at age 16 he migrated to Canada where he worked odd jobs such as a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]]. During this time he began engrossed in the writings of economist [[Henry George]] and socialist [[Edward Bellamy]]. In 1881 by the age of 24 he became a reporter for the [[Detroit Free Press]], where he would meet his future wife Ann Macquire whom he would marry on 22 July 1883.\n\n==Radical journalism in Australia==\nIn 1885 William and Ann Lane, along with brother John, as well as their first child migrated to [[Brisbane]], Australia, where Lane immediately got work as a feature writer for the weekly newspaper ''[[Queensland Figaro]]'', then as a columnist for the newspapers [[Brisbane Courier]] and the Evening Telegraph, using a number of pseudonyms (''Lucinda Sharpe'', which some consider to be the work of Lane's spouse; ''William Wilcher;'' and ''Sketcher'').\n\nLane's childhood experiences as the son of a drunkard fashioned him into a [[Teetotalism|lifelong abstainer]] from alcohol. In 1886 he created an Australia-wide sensation by spending a night in the Brisbane lock-up disguised as a drunk, and subsequently reporting the conditions of the cells as \"Henry Harris\". Lane's father was a drunk who impoverished the family.<ref name=\"ADB\" />\n\nWith the growth of the [[Australian labour movement]], Lane's columns under the ''Sketcher'' pseudonym, especially his \"Labour Notes\" in the Evening Telegraph, began to increasingly promote [[Labour movement|labourist philosophy]]. Lane himself began to attend meetings supporting all manner of popular causes, speaking against repressive laws and practices and Chinese immigrants, all while utilising a charismatic American intonation he had attained during his time in the States.\n\nAfter becoming the de facto editor of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], Lane left the newspaper during November 1887 to found the weekly ''[[The Boomerang]]'', a newspaper described as \"a live newspaper, racy, of the soil\", in which pro-worker themes and lurid racism were brought to a fever-pitch by both ''Sketcher'' and ''Lucinda Sharpe''. He became a powerful supporter of [[Emma Miller]] and [[women's suffrage]]. A strong proponent of [[Henry George]]'s [[Single Tax]] Movement, Lane became increasingly committed to a radically alternative society, and ended his relationship with the ''Boomerang'' due to its private ownership.\n\nIn May 1890 he began the trade union funded Brisbane weekly ''[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]]'', the rhetoric of which became increasingly threatening towards the employers, the government, and the British Empire itself. The defeat of the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]] convinced Lane that there would be no real social change without a completely new society, and ''The Worker'' became increasingly devoted to his New Australia [[utopian]] idea which would later be made a reality.\n\n===''White or Yellow?''===\n[[File:1910 White Australia badge.png|thumb|300px|In 1910, fear of the [[Yellow Peril]] prompted the nativist Australian Natives' Association to create the White Australia badge, with which the wearer could identify his or her racial loyalty<ref>See [http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ Museum Victoria description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105150237/http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ |date=5 January 2016 }}</ref>]]\nAlthough his efforts were primarily directed towards the non-fictional, Lane was an avid author whose works deeply reflected his political philosophy, as short as his bibliography is. ''The Workingman's Paradise'', an allegorical novel written in sympathy with those involved in the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|1891 shearers' strike]], was published under his pseudonym John Miller in early 1892. In the novel Lane articulated the belief that [[anarchism]] is the noblest social philosophy of all.

After showing great skill in his education, he worked his way into [[Canada]] as first a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]], then as a reporter for the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' where he would later meet his future wife Ann Lane, ''n\u00e9e'' Macquire. After settling in Australia with his wife and child, as well as his brother John, he became active in the Australian labour movement, founding the Australian Labour Federation and becoming a prolific journalist for the movement. He authored works covering topics such as [[Labor rights|labour rights]] and [[white nationalism]].\n\nAfter becoming disillusioned with the state of Australian politics following an [[History of the Australian Labor Party|ideological split]] in the labour movement, he and a group of utopian acolytes (among them influential writer and poet [[Mary Gilmore]]) moved to [[Paraguay]] in 1892 to found [[New Australia]], with the intention of building a new society on the foundations of his utopian ideals. Following disagreement with the colony regarding the legality of [[miscegenation]] and [[Drinking culture|alcohol consumption]], he left to found the nearby colony Cosme in May 1894, and later abandoned the project altogether in 1899.\n\nUpon resetting in [[New Zealand]] he continued his journalistic endeavours until his death in August 1917. After his death he was both celebrated as a champion of utopian socialism, and condemned as the arrogant leader of a failed new society. Due to his radical politics and his extensive journalistic career, he remains a controversial figure in Australian history.\n\n==Early life==\nLane was born in [[Bristol]], England on 6 September 1861, as the eldest son of James Lane, an [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] landscape gardener, and his English wife Caroline, ''n\u00e9e'' Hall.<ref name=ADB/> Lane was born with a debilitating [[clubfoot]], a condition that would be partially corrected in [[Montreal]] later in life, leaving him with a limp. Lane's father James was a drunkard who when Lane was born was earning a miserable wage, but later he improved his circumstances and became an employer.\n\nThe young Lane was educated at [[Bristol Grammar School]] and demonstrated himself as a gifted student, but he was sent early to work as an office boy. Lane's mother died when he was 14 years of age, and at age 16 he migrated to Canada where he worked odd jobs such as a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]]. During this time he began engrossed in the writings of economist [[Henry George]] and socialist [[Edward Bellamy]]. In 1881 by the age of 24 he became a reporter for the [[Detroit Free Press]], where he would meet his future wife Ann Macquire whom he would marry on 22 July 1883.\n\n==Radical journalism in Australia==\nIn 1885 William and Ann Lane, along with brother John, as well as their first child migrated to [[Brisbane]], Australia, where Lane immediately got work as a feature writer for the weekly newspaper ''[[Queensland Figaro]]'', then as a columnist for the newspapers [[Brisbane Courier]] and the Evening Telegraph, using a number of pseudonyms (''Lucinda Sharpe'', which some consider to be the work of Lane's spouse; ''William Wilcher;'' and ''Sketcher'').\n\nLane's childhood experiences as the son of a drunkard fashioned him into a [[Teetotalism|lifelong abstainer]] from alcohol. In 1886 he created an Australia-wide sensation by spending a night in the Brisbane lock-up disguised as a drunk, and subsequently reporting the conditions of the cells as \"Henry Harris\". Lane's father was a drunk who impoverished the family.<ref name=\"ADB\" />\n\nWith the growth of the [[Australian labour movement]], Lane's columns under the ''Sketcher'' pseudonym, especially his \"Labour Notes\" in the Evening Telegraph, began to increasingly promote [[Labour movement|labourist philosophy]]. Lane himself began to attend meetings supporting all manner of popular causes, speaking against repressive laws and practices and Chinese immigrants, all while utilising a charismatic American intonation he had attained during his time in the States.\n\nAfter becoming the de facto editor of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], Lane left the newspaper during November 1887 to found the weekly ''[[The Boomerang]]'', a newspaper described as \"a live newspaper, racy, of the soil\", in which pro-worker themes and lurid racism were brought to a fever-pitch by both ''Sketcher'' and ''Lucinda Sharpe''. He became a powerful supporter of [[Emma Miller]] and [[women's suffrage]]. A strong proponent of [[Henry George]]'s [[Single Tax]] Movement, Lane became increasingly committed to a radically alternative society, and ended his relationship with the ''Boomerang'' due to its private ownership.\n\nIn May 1890 he began the trade union funded Brisbane weekly ''[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]]'', the rhetoric of which became increasingly threatening towards the employers, the government, and the British Empire itself. The defeat of the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]] convinced Lane that there would be no real social change without a completely new society, and ''The Worker'' became increasingly devoted to his New Australia [[utopian]] idea which would later be made a reality.\n\n===''White or Yellow?''===\n[[File:1910 White Australia badge.png|thumb|300px|In 1910, fear of the [[Yellow Peril]] prompted the nativist Australian Natives' Association to create the White Australia badge, with which the wearer could identify his or her racial loyalty<ref>See [http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ Museum Victoria description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105150237/http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ |date=5 January 2016 }}</ref>]]\nAlthough his efforts were primarily directed towards the non-fictional, Lane was an avid author whose works deeply reflected his political philosophy, as short as his bibliography is. ''The Workingman's Paradise'', an allegorical novel written in sympathy with those involved in the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|1891 shearers' strike]], was published under his pseudonym John Miller in early 1892. In the novel Lane articulated the belief that [[anarchism]] is the noblest social philosophy of all. Through the novel's philosopher and main protagonist he relates his belief that society may have to experience a period of [[state socialism]] to achieve the ideal of [[anarcho-communism]]. [[Mary Gilmore]], later a celebrated Australian writer, said in one of her letters that \"the whole book is true and of historical value as Lane transcribed our conversations as well as those of others\".\n\nMost prominent in his bibliography is his novella ''White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908'' (1887). In this work, Lane proposed a horde of Chinese people would legally arrive to Australia, who would then overrun White society and monopolise the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the \"empty north\" of the continent.<ref name=\"Affeldt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stefanieaffeldt.net/texte/Affeldt_WhiteSugarYellowPeril2011.pdf|title='White Sugar' against 'Yellow Peril' Consuming for National Identify and Racial Purity|last=Affeldt|first=Stefanie|date=12 July 2011|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=29 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029191529/http://www.stefanieaffeldt.net/texte/Affeldt_WhiteSugarYellowPeril2011.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As Australian [[invasion literature]], ''White or Yellow?'' reflects Lane's nationalist [[racialism]] and left-wing politics within a [[future history]] of Australia under attack by the [[Yellow Peril]].\n\n[[File:Oceania UN Geoscheme - Map of Melanesia.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Yellow Peril proscriptions of the White Australia policies excluded the brown-skinned peoples of Melanesia from immigration to Australia.]]\nLane wrote that in the near future, British capitalists would manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of its socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society.

Although circulated in manuscript form, some finding anonymous publication in print, they were too politically sensitive and thus dangerous to be published under his name until well after his death. Marvell took up opposition to the 'court party', and satirised them anonymously. In his longest verse satire, ''Last Instructions to a Painter'', written in 1667, Marvell responded to the political corruption that had contributed to English failures during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. The poem did not find print publication until after the Revolution of 1688\u20139. The poem instructs an imaginary painter how to picture the state without a proper navy to defend them, led by men without intelligence or courage, a corrupt and dissolute court, and dishonest officials. Of another such satire, [[Samuel Pepys]], himself a government official, commented in his [[Diary of Samuel Pepys|diary]], \"Here I met with a fourth Advice to a Painter upon the coming in of the Dutch and the End of the War, that made my heart ake to read, it being too sharp and so true.\"<ref>16 September 1667, ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VxA5AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA657&ots=Nq_VMQ6dqf&dq=%22%20%22Here%20I%20met%20with%20a%20fourth%20Advice%20to%20a%20Painter%20upon%20the%20coming%20in%20of%20the%20Dutch%20%22&pg=PA657#v=onepage&q=%22%20%22Here%20I%20met%20with%20a%20fourth%20Advice%20to%20a%20Painter%20upon%20the%20coming%20in%20of%20the%20Dutch%20%22&f=false Volume 2, p.657]</ref>\n\nFrom 1659 until his death in 1678, Marvell was serving as London agent for the Hull Trinity House, a shipmasters' [[guild]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} He went on two missions to the continent, one to the [[Dutch Republic]] and the other encompassing Russia, Sweden, and Denmark.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} He spent some time living in a cottage on Highgate Hill in north London, where his time in the area is recorded by a bronze plaque that bears the following inscription:<blockquote>Four feet below this spot is the stone step, formerly the entrance to the cottage in which lived Andrew Marvell, poet, wit, and satirist; colleague with John Milton in the foreign or Latin secretaryship during the Commonwealth; and for about twenty years M.P. for Hull. Born at Winestead, Yorkshire, 31st March, 1621, died in London, 18th August, 1678, and buried in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.

His health had previously been remarkably good; and it was supposed by many that he was poisoned by some of his political or clerical enemies. Marvell was buried in the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]] in central London. His monument, erected by his grateful constituency, bears the following inscription:<blockquote>Near this place lyeth the body of Andrew Marvell, Esq., a man so endowed by Nature, so improved by Education, Study, and Travel, so consummated by Experience, that, joining the peculiar graces of Wit and Learning, with a singular penetration and strength of judgment; and exercising all these in the whole course of his life, with an unutterable steadiness in the ways of Virtue, he became the ornament and example of his age, beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired by all, though imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any. But a Tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is Marble necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings, nevertheless. He having served twenty years successfully in Parliament, and that with such Wisdom, Dexterity, and Courage, as becomes a true Patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, from whence he was deputed to that Assembly, lamenting in his death the public loss, have erected this Monument of their Grief and their Gratitude, 1688.</blockquote>\n\n==Prose works==\nMarvell also wrote anonymous prose satires criticizing the monarchy and Roman Catholicism, defending [[Puritan]] dissenters, and denouncing censorship.\n\n''The Rehearsal Transpros'd'', an attack on [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]], was published in two parts in 1672 and 1673.\n\nIn 1676, ''Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode'', a work critical of intolerance within the Church of England, was published together with a \"Short Historical Essay, concerning General Councils, Creeds, and Impositions, in matters of Religion.\"\n\nMarvell's pamphlet ''An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England'', published in late 1677, alleged that: \"There has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of ''England'' into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Popery\".<ref>Andrew Marvell, ''An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England'' (Gregg International Publishers Limited, 1971), p. 3.</ref> [[John Phillipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]] described it as \"one of the most influential pamphlets of the decade\"<ref>John Kenyon, ''The Popish Plot'' (Phoenix, 2000), p. 24.</ref> and [[G. M. Trevelyan]] called it: \"A fine pamphlet, which throws light on causes provocative of the formation of the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig party]]\".<ref>G. M. Trevelyan, ''England under the Stuarts'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 513.</ref>\n\nA 1678 work published anonymously (\"by a Protestant\") in defense of [[John Howe (Puritan)|John Howe]] against the attack of his fellow-dissenter, the severe Calvinist [[Thomas Danson]], is also probably by Marvell.  Its full title is ''Remarks upon a late disingenuous discourse, writ by one T.D. under the pretence de causa Dei, and of answering Mr. John Howe's letter and postscript of God's prescience, &c., affirming, as the Protestant doctrine, that God doth by efficacious influence universally move and determine men to all their actions, even to those that are most wicked''.\n\n==Views==\nAlthough Marvell became a [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] and was opposed to [[episcopacy]], he was not a [[Puritan]]. Later in life especially, he seems to have been a conforming Anglican.<ref>http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-18242</ref> Marvell positively identifies himself as \"a Protestant\" in pamphlets.<ref>http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-1824</ref>  He had flirted briefly with Catholicism as a youth,<ref>John Dixon Hunt ''Andrew Marvell: his life and writings'' (Paul Elek, 1978)  pp.&nbsp;24\u201325</ref> and was described in his thirties (on the Saumur visit) as \"a notable English Italo-[[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]]\".<ref>http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/Old%20Site/lists/MarvellDates.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113053703/http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/Old%20Site/lists/MarvellDates.htm |date=13 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>Robert R.

Many of his poems were not published until 1681, three years after his death, from a collection owned by Mary Palmer, his housekeeper. After Marvell's death she laid dubious claim to having been his wife, from the time of a secret marriage in 1667.<ref>Nicholas Murray, ''Andrew Marvell'' (1999), pp. 296\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Marvell's poetic style==\n[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote of Marvell's style that 'It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace'. He also identified Marvell and the metaphysical school with the 'dissociation of sensibility' that occurred in 17th-century English literature; Eliot described this trend as 'something which... happened to the mind of England... it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet'.<ref>T. S. Eliot.\"The Metaphysical Poets\" and \"Andrew Marvell\". Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot. ed. Frank Kermode. Harcourt, 1975.</ref> Poets increasingly developed a self-conscious relationship to tradition, which took the form of a new emphasis on craftsmanship of expression and an idiosyncratic freedom in allusions to Classical and Biblical sources.\n\nMarvell's most celebrated lyric, \"To His Coy Mistress\", combines an old poetic conceit (the persuasion of the speaker's lover by means of a carpe diem philosophy) with Marvell's typically vibrant imagery and easy command of rhyming couplets. Other works incorporate topical satire and religious themes.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHis work is referenced in the 1997 British film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]'' and quoted in the 1946 British film ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. It is also referenced in Audrey Niffenegger's ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' and Emily Colin's ''The Memory Thief''. \n\nSeveral works of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery allude to \"[[To His Coy Mistress#Allusions in other works|To His Coy Mistress]]\".\n\nIn 2003, Christopher Peachment published \"The Green and the Gold\", a first-person fictional narrative following Marvell's life.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of works by Andrew Marvell]]\n*[[Andrew Marvell College]]\n*{{ship||Andrew Marvel|1812 ship}} - ship built at [[Kingston upon Hull]] that made some 24 voyages as a [[Whaling#Greenland|Greenland whaler]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* A.

Although circulated in manuscript form, some finding anonymous publication in print, they were too politically sensitive and thus dangerous to be published under his name until well after his death. Marvell took up opposition to the 'court party', and satirised them anonymously. In his longest verse satire, ''Last Instructions to a Painter'', written in 1667, Marvell responded to the political corruption that had contributed to English failures during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. The poem did not find print publication until after the Revolution of 1688\u20139. The poem instructs an imaginary painter how to picture the state without a proper navy to defend them, led by men without intelligence or courage, a corrupt and dissolute court, and dishonest officials. Of another such satire, [[Samuel Pepys]], himself a government official, commented in his [[Diary of Samuel Pepys|diary]], \"Here I met with a fourth Advice to a Painter upon the coming in of the Dutch and the End of the War, that made my heart ake to read, it being too sharp and so true.\"<ref>16 September 1667, ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VxA5AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA657&ots=Nq_VMQ6dqf&dq=%22%20%22Here%20I%20met%20with%20a%20fourth%20Advice%20to%20a%20Painter%20upon%20the%20coming%20in%20of%20the%20Dutch%20%22&pg=PA657#v=onepage&q=%22%20%22Here%20I%20met%20with%20a%20fourth%20Advice%20to%20a%20Painter%20upon%20the%20coming%20in%20of%20the%20Dutch%20%22&f=false Volume 2, p.657]</ref>\n\nFrom 1659 until his death in 1678, Marvell was serving as London agent for the Hull Trinity House, a shipmasters' [[guild]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} He went on two missions to the continent, one to the [[Dutch Republic]] and the other encompassing Russia, Sweden, and Denmark.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} He spent some time living in a cottage on Highgate Hill in north London, where his time in the area is recorded by a bronze plaque that bears the following inscription:<blockquote>Four feet below this spot is the stone step, formerly the entrance to the cottage in which lived Andrew Marvell, poet, wit, and satirist; colleague with John Milton in the foreign or Latin secretaryship during the Commonwealth; and for about twenty years M.P. for Hull.

His health had previously been remarkably good; and it was supposed by many that he was poisoned by some of his political or clerical enemies. Marvell was buried in the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]] in central London. His monument, erected by his grateful constituency, bears the following inscription:<blockquote>Near this place lyeth the body of Andrew Marvell, Esq., a man so endowed by Nature, so improved by Education, Study, and Travel, so consummated by Experience, that, joining the peculiar graces of Wit and Learning, with a singular penetration and strength of judgment; and exercising all these in the whole course of his life, with an unutterable steadiness in the ways of Virtue, he became the ornament and example of his age, beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired by all, though imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any. But a Tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is Marble necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings, nevertheless. He having served twenty years successfully in Parliament, and that with such Wisdom, Dexterity, and Courage, as becomes a true Patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, from whence he was deputed to that Assembly, lamenting in his death the public loss, have erected this Monument of their Grief and their Gratitude, 1688.</blockquote>\n\n==Prose works==\nMarvell also wrote anonymous prose satires criticizing the monarchy and Roman Catholicism, defending [[Puritan]] dissenters, and denouncing censorship.\n\n''The Rehearsal Transpros'd'', an attack on [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]], was published in two parts in 1672 and 1673.\n\nIn 1676, ''Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode'', a work critical of intolerance within the Church of England, was published together with a \"Short Historical Essay, concerning General Councils, Creeds, and Impositions, in matters of Religion.\"\n\nMarvell's pamphlet ''An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England'', published in late 1677, alleged that: \"There has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of ''England'' into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Popery\".<ref>Andrew Marvell, ''An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England'' (Gregg International Publishers Limited, 1971), p. 3.</ref> [[John Phillipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]] described it as \"one of the most influential pamphlets of the decade\"<ref>John Kenyon, ''The Popish Plot'' (Phoenix, 2000), p. 24.</ref> and [[G.

Trevelyan, ''England under the Stuarts'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 513.</ref>\n\nA 1678 work published anonymously (\"by a Protestant\") in defense of [[John Howe (Puritan)|John Howe]] against the attack of his fellow-dissenter, the severe Calvinist [[Thomas Danson]], is also probably by Marvell.  Its full title is ''Remarks upon a late disingenuous discourse, writ by one T.D. under the pretence de causa Dei, and of answering Mr. John Howe's letter and postscript of God's prescience, &c., affirming, as the Protestant doctrine, that God doth by efficacious influence universally move and determine men to all their actions, even to those that are most wicked''.\n\n==Views==\nAlthough Marvell became a [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] and was opposed to [[episcopacy]], he was not a [[Puritan]].

Many of his poems were not published until 1681, three years after his death, from a collection owned by Mary Palmer, his housekeeper. After Marvell's death she laid dubious claim to having been his wife, from the time of a secret marriage in 1667.<ref>Nicholas Murray, ''Andrew Marvell'' (1999), pp. 296\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Marvell's poetic style==\n[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote of Marvell's style that 'It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace'. He also identified Marvell and the metaphysical school with the 'dissociation of sensibility' that occurred in 17th-century English literature; Eliot described this trend as 'something which... happened to the mind of England... it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet'.<ref>T. S. Eliot.\"The Metaphysical Poets\" and \"Andrew Marvell\". Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot. ed. Frank Kermode. Harcourt, 1975.</ref> Poets increasingly developed a self-conscious relationship to tradition, which took the form of a new emphasis on craftsmanship of expression and an idiosyncratic freedom in allusions to Classical and Biblical sources.\n\nMarvell's most celebrated lyric, \"To His Coy Mistress\", combines an old poetic conceit (the persuasion of the speaker's lover by means of a carpe diem philosophy) with Marvell's typically vibrant imagery and easy command of rhyming couplets. Other works incorporate topical satire and religious themes.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHis work is referenced in the 1997 British film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]'' and quoted in the 1946 British film ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. It is also referenced in Audrey Niffenegger's ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' and Emily Colin's ''The Memory Thief''. \n\nSeveral works of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery allude to \"[[To His Coy Mistress#Allusions in other works|To His Coy Mistress]]\".\n\nIn 2003, Christopher Peachment published \"The Green and the Gold\", a first-person fictional narrative following Marvell's life.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of works by Andrew Marvell]]\n*[[Andrew Marvell College]]\n*{{ship||Andrew Marvel|1812 ship}} - ship built at [[Kingston upon Hull]] that made some 24 voyages as a [[Whaling#Greenland|Greenland whaler]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* A.

His manipulation of [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]] \u2013 particularly his concept of [[sprung rhythm]] and use of [[Imagery (literature)|imagery]] \u2013 established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did [[Robert Bridges]] begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognised as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as [[T. S.

His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian [[consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consul-general]] in London. He was also for a time [[churchwarden]] at [[St John-at-Hampstead]]. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of [[John Keats]], and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist [[Ann Thwaytes]].\n\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including ''A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems'' (1843), ''Pietas Metrica'' (1849), and ''Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins'' (1892). He reviewed poetry for ''[[The Times]]'' and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially [[German philosophy]], literature and the novels of [[Dickens]]. Both parents were deeply religious [[high-church]] Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle [[Richard James Lane]], a professional artist, and many other family members.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> Hopkins's first ambition was to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired as an adult by the work of [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/><ref name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81375 Poetry Foundation Biography] accessed 18 March 2010</ref>\n\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman, and found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent (1849\u20131946) joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate (1856\u20131933) would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. [[Lionel Charles Hopkins|Lionel]] (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were both highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) was to join his father's insurance firm.<ref name=\"PF\" />\n[[File:Young Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins, painted 24 July 1866]]\n\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where [[John Keats]] had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of [[Hampstead Heath]]. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at [[Highgate School]] (1854\u20131863).<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week.

On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for [[Lent]]. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, [[John Henry Newman]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\"/> Newman received him into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 21 October 1866.\n\nThe decision to convert estranged him from his family and from a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. He paused to first visit [[Switzerland]], which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">P. Kitchen, ''Gerard Manley Hopkins'', London, 1978.</ref>\n\nHopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at [[Parkstead House|Manresa House]], [[Roehampton]], in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Mary's Hall, [[Stonyhurst]], for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerardmanleyhopkins.net/about/gerard_manley_hopkins.html |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins, Poet Priest Artist Writer Musician |work=Gerard Manley Hopkins' poems to music |first=Sean |last=O'Leary |accessdate=15 May 2017 |date=July 2006}}</ref> He felt his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading [[Duns Scotus]] in 1872, he saw that the two need not conflict.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hopkins/hopkins12.html Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Brief Biography] Glenn Everett, PhD.</ref> He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some \"verses,\" as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.\n\nIn 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]], near [[St Asaph]] in [[North Wales]], he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875, he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem, \"[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]\". The work was inspired by the ''[[Deutschland (1866)|Deutschland]]'' incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five [[Franciscan]] nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh [[anti-Catholic]] laws (see [[Kulturkampf]]). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual [[meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poet's reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.\n\n[[File:GerardManleyHopkinsBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Hopkins in Roehampton, London]]\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\"<ref name=Ricks/> The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote ''God's Grandeur'', an array of sonnets which included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"[[The Windhover]]\" only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as sub-minister and teacher at [[Mount St Mary's College]] near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of [[Oxford Oratory|St Aloysius's Church, Oxford]], then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.<ref name=\"PF\" /> While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of [[The Newman Society]], a society established in 1878 for Catholic members of the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught Greek and Latin at [[Mount St Mary's College]], Sheffield, and [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire.\n\nIn 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at [[University College Dublin]].<ref>New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin</ref> His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature (5 feet 2 inches), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This, as well as his isolation in Ireland, deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\", reflected this. They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not because of their quality but because according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkins's life.\n\n===Final years===\nSeveral issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxxvii\">Gardner, W.&nbsp;H. (1963) ''Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxxvii</ref> His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gerard-manley-hopkins-ucd-misery-was-literature-s-gain-1.3091916</ref> His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.\n\nAfter suffering ill health for several years and bouts of [[diarrhoea]], Hopkins died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1889 and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]],<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3rd ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 22019). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> following his funeral in [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street]], located in Georgian [[Dublin]]. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either [[bipolar disorder]] or chronic [[unipolar depression]],{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.\"<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n\n==Poetry==\n===\"The sonnets of desolation\"===\nAccording to [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'... \" a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n08/john-bayley/pork-chops Bayley, John. \"Review: Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life by Robert Bernard Martin\", ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 13 No. 8, 25 April 1991]</ref> Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His \"terrible sonnets\" struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as \"[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while.\"<ref name=Allbery>[http://poems.com/Poets'%20Picks%202012/April_24_Debra_Allbery.html Allbery, Debra. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poetry Daily, April 24, 2012]</ref>\n\n\"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord\" (1889) echoes ''Jeremiah'' 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of a faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person (\"Sir\") capable of hearing the complaint, but seemingly unwilling to listen.<ref>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/hopkins-agonistes Boudway, Matthew. \"Hopkins Agonistes\", ''Commonweal'', April 25, 2011]</ref> Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.\n\nThe image of the poet's estrangement from God figures in \"I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day\", in which he describes lying awake before dawn, likening his prayers to \"dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away.\" The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2: \"He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.\"\n\n\"No Worst, There is None\" and \"Carrion Comfort\" are also counted among the \"terrible sonnets\".\n\n===Sprung rhythm===\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n'''\"Pied Beauty\"'''\n\nGlory be to God for dappled things\u2014\n For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;\n For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;\nFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;\n Landscape plotted and pieced\u2014fold, fallow, and plough;\n And \u00e1ll tr\u00e1des, their gear and tackle and trim.\n\nAll things counter, original, spare, strange;\n Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)\n With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;\nHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:\n Praise him.</poem>\n |source = \"Pied Beauty\" written 1877.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173664 \"Pied Beauty\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref> }}\n\nMuch of Hopkins's historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous example.\n\nHopkins called his own rhythmic structure [[sprung rhythm]]. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of [[Robinson Jeffers]], another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame\". In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of [[free verse]]. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary [[Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[neo-romanticism]] schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to [[modernist poetry]], or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\n\n===Use of language===\nThe language of Hopkins's poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in ''Heaven-Haven'', where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in ''As Kingfishers Catch Fire'', where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.\n\nHopkins was a supporter of [[linguistic purism in English]]. In an 1882 letter to [[Robert Bridges]], Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\"<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328.</ref> He took time to learn [[Old English]], which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"<ref name=\"BROOK-1\">[[George Leslie Brook|Brook, George Leslie]] (1955). ''An Introduction to Old English'', Manchester University Press, p. 1.</ref>\n\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is ''twindles'', which seems from its context in ''Inversnaid'' to mean a combination of ''twines'' and ''dwindles''. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as ''dapple-dawn-drawn falcon'') but often without, as in ''rolling level underneath him steady air''. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of [[Kenning|compounds nouns]], concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the [[instress]] of the poet's perceptions of an [[inscape]].\n\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhyme]], both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n</poem>}}\n\nHopkins was influenced by the [[Welsh language]], which he had acquired while studying theology at [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]] near [[St Asaph]]. The poetic forms of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]] and particularly [[cynghanedd]], with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of inscape, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian [[Duns Scotus]]. Anthony Domestico explains,<blockquote>Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"<ref name=Domestico/></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Windhover]]'' aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n\nI caught this morning morning's minion, king-\n dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind.

It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then [[poet laureate]], published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by [[William Henry Gardner]] appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\n\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in [[Campion Hall, Oxford]]; the [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and the Foley Library at [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://researchguides.gonzaga.edu/c.php?g=67720&p=436824 |title=LibGuides: Manuscript Collections: Hopkins |last=Plowman |first=Stephanie |website=researchguides.gonzaga.edu  |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n====Erotic====\nTimothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met [[Robert Bridges]]'s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian [[Digby Mackworth Dolben]], \"a Christian [[Uranian]]\".<ref>Timothy d'Arch Smith. ''Love in Earnest'', p. 188.</ref> Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.</ref> According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" ''DNB'')</ref> Martin also considers it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdXg7cVBH8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Bernard+Martin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF_-ez_NjOAhUHGR4KHV07D0cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Bernard%20Martin&f=false Martin, Robert Bernard. ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', Chapter III, Faber and Faber]</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerard Manley Hopkins]]\nHopkins composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End\". Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |title=Joseph Cady ''English Literature: Nineteenth Century'' |access-date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301045049/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |archive-date=1 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again after the latter's short visit to Oxford during which they met, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\"<ref>Michael M. Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde''.

Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins; now first published, edited with notes by Robert Bridges. London: Humphrey Milford, 1918.</ref> One contemporary critic, M. M. Kaylor, argued for Hopkins's inclusion with the [[Uranian poetry|Uranian poets]], a group whose writings derived, in many ways, from prose works of [[Walter Pater]], Hopkins's academic coach for his Greats exams and later a lifelong friend.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''The Bugler's First Communion,'' Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires''. pp 182\u201393]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''Epithalamion'' in Kaylor ''Secreted Desires'', pp 161\u2013205]</ref><ref>''Victorian Poetry'' 40.2 (2002), pp. 157\u2013187.</ref>\n\nSome critics have argued that homoerotic readings are either highly tendentious, or that they can be classified under the broader category of \"[[homosociality]]\", over the gender, sexual-specific \"homosexual\" term. Hopkins's journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In his book ''Hopkins Reconstructed'' (2000), Justus George Lawler criticises Robert Martin's controversial biography ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'' (1991) by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted [[eisegesis]]\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. Julia Saville's book ''A Queer Chivalry'' views the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins's way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\n\n[[Christopher Ricks]] notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\"<ref name=Ricks/> Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family.<ref name=Ricks/> Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"<ref name=Domestico>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inscape-instress-distress?_ga=1.190997742.596395981.1472016212 Domestico, Anthony. \"Inscape, Instress & Distress\", ''Commonweal'', March 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n====Isolation====\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins's isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings.<ref name=Allbery/> The poem \"To seem the stranger\" was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-seem-the-stranger-lies-my-lot-my-life/ Hopkins, Gerard M. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poemhunter.com]</ref>\n\n==Influence on others==\nRicks called Hopkins \"the most original poet of the Victorian age.\"<ref name=Ricks>[https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-art-and-faith-of-Gerard-Manley-Hopkins-4424 Ricks, Christopher. \"The art and faith of Gerard Manley Hopkins\", ''The New Criterion'', September 1991]</ref> Hopkins is considered as influential as [[T.

His manipulation of [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]] \u2013 particularly his concept of [[sprung rhythm]] and use of [[Imagery (literature)|imagery]] \u2013 established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did [[Robert Bridges]] begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognised as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].\n\n==Life==\n===Early life and family ===\nGerard Manley Hopkins was born in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[South Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\">Gardner, W.

His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian [[consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consul-general]] in London. He was also for a time [[churchwarden]] at [[St John-at-Hampstead]]. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of [[John Keats]], and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist [[Ann Thwaytes]].\n\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including ''A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems'' (1843), ''Pietas Metrica'' (1849), and ''Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins'' (1892). He reviewed poetry for ''[[The Times]]'' and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially [[German philosophy]], literature and the novels of [[Dickens]]. Both parents were deeply religious [[high-church]] Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle [[Richard James Lane]], a professional artist, and many other family members.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> Hopkins's first ambition was to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired as an adult by the work of [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/><ref name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81375 Poetry Foundation Biography] accessed 18 March 2010</ref>\n\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman, and found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent (1849\u20131946) joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate (1856\u20131933) would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. [[Lionel Charles Hopkins|Lionel]] (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were both highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) was to join his father's insurance firm.<ref name=\"PF\" />\n[[File:Young Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins, painted 24 July 1866]]\n\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where [[John Keats]] had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of [[Hampstead Heath]]. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at [[Highgate School]] (1854\u20131863).<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill. On another occasion, he abstained from salt for a week.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ER\">Eleanor Ruggles (1944) ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Life''.

Gardner (1963), ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin p. xvii.</ref> He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, but he seems to have alarmed himself with the changes in his behaviour that resulted. At Oxford he forged a lifelong friendship with [[Robert Bridges]] (eventual [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]]), which would be of importance in his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvii\"/> Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of [[Christina Rossetti]] and she became one of his greatest contemporary influences, meeting him in 1864.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\">Gardner, W.

On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for [[Lent]]. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, [[John Henry Newman]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\"/> Newman received him into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 21 October 1866.\n\nThe decision to convert estranged him from his family and from a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. He paused to first visit [[Switzerland]], which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">P. Kitchen, ''Gerard Manley Hopkins'', London, 1978.</ref>\n\nHopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at [[Parkstead House|Manresa House]], [[Roehampton]], in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Mary's Hall, [[Stonyhurst]], for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerardmanleyhopkins.net/about/gerard_manley_hopkins.html |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins, Poet Priest Artist Writer Musician |work=Gerard Manley Hopkins' poems to music |first=Sean |last=O'Leary |accessdate=15 May 2017 |date=July 2006}}</ref> He felt his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading [[Duns Scotus]] in 1872, he saw that the two need not conflict.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hopkins/hopkins12.html Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Brief Biography] Glenn Everett, PhD.</ref> He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some \"verses,\" as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.\n\nIn 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]], near [[St Asaph]] in [[North Wales]], he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875, he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem, \"[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]\". The work was inspired by the ''[[Deutschland (1866)|Deutschland]]'' incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five [[Franciscan]] nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh [[anti-Catholic]] laws (see [[Kulturkampf]]). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual [[meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poet's reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.\n\n[[File:GerardManleyHopkinsBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Hopkins in Roehampton, London]]\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\"<ref name=Ricks/> The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote ''God's Grandeur'', an array of sonnets which included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"[[The Windhover]]\" only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as sub-minister and teacher at [[Mount St Mary's College]] near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of [[Oxford Oratory|St Aloysius's Church, Oxford]], then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.<ref name=\"PF\" /> While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of [[The Newman Society]], a society established in 1878 for Catholic members of the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught Greek and Latin at [[Mount St Mary's College]], Sheffield, and [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire.\n\nIn 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at [[University College Dublin]].<ref>New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin</ref> His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature (5 feet 2 inches), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This, as well as his isolation in Ireland, deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\", reflected this. They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not because of their quality but because according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkins's life.\n\n===Final years===\nSeveral issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxxvii\">Gardner, W.&nbsp;H. (1963) ''Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxxvii</ref> His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gerard-manley-hopkins-ucd-misery-was-literature-s-gain-1.3091916</ref> His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.\n\nAfter suffering ill health for several years and bouts of [[diarrhoea]], Hopkins died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1889 and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]],<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3rd ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 22019). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> following his funeral in [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street]], located in Georgian [[Dublin]]. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either [[bipolar disorder]] or chronic [[unipolar depression]],{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.\"<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n\n==Poetry==\n===\"The sonnets of desolation\"===\nAccording to [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'... \" a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n08/john-bayley/pork-chops Bayley, John. \"Review: Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life by Robert Bernard Martin\", ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 13 No. 8, 25 April 1991]</ref> Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His \"terrible sonnets\" struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as \"[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while.\"<ref name=Allbery>[http://poems.com/Poets'%20Picks%202012/April_24_Debra_Allbery.html Allbery, Debra. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poetry Daily, April 24, 2012]</ref>\n\n\"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord\" (1889) echoes ''Jeremiah'' 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of a faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person (\"Sir\") capable of hearing the complaint, but seemingly unwilling to listen.<ref>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/hopkins-agonistes Boudway, Matthew. \"Hopkins Agonistes\", ''Commonweal'', April 25, 2011]</ref> Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.\n\nThe image of the poet's estrangement from God figures in \"I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day\", in which he describes lying awake before dawn, likening his prayers to \"dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away.\" The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2: \"He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.\"\n\n\"No Worst, There is None\" and \"Carrion Comfort\" are also counted among the \"terrible sonnets\".\n\n===Sprung rhythm===\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n'''\"Pied Beauty\"'''\n\nGlory be to God for dappled things\u2014\n For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;\n For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;\nFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;\n Landscape plotted and pieced\u2014fold, fallow, and plough;\n And \u00e1ll tr\u00e1des, their gear and tackle and trim.\n\nAll things counter, original, spare, strange;\n Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)\n With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;\nHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:\n Praise him.</poem>\n |source = \"Pied Beauty\" written 1877.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173664 \"Pied Beauty\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref> }}\n\nMuch of Hopkins's historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous example.\n\nHopkins called his own rhythmic structure [[sprung rhythm]]. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of [[Robinson Jeffers]], another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame\". In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of [[free verse]]. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary [[Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[neo-romanticism]] schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to [[modernist poetry]], or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\n\n===Use of language===\nThe language of Hopkins's poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in ''Heaven-Haven'', where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in ''As Kingfishers Catch Fire'', where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.\n\nHopkins was a supporter of [[linguistic purism in English]]. In an 1882 letter to [[Robert Bridges]], Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\"<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328.</ref> He took time to learn [[Old English]], which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"<ref name=\"BROOK-1\">[[George Leslie Brook|Brook, George Leslie]] (1955). ''An Introduction to Old English'', Manchester University Press, p. 1.</ref>\n\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is ''twindles'', which seems from its context in ''Inversnaid'' to mean a combination of ''twines'' and ''dwindles''. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as ''dapple-dawn-drawn falcon'') but often without, as in ''rolling level underneath him steady air''. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of [[Kenning|compounds nouns]], concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the [[instress]] of the poet's perceptions of an [[inscape]].\n\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhyme]], both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n</poem>}}\n\nHopkins was influenced by the [[Welsh language]], which he had acquired while studying theology at [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]] near [[St Asaph]]. The poetic forms of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]] and particularly [[cynghanedd]], with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of inscape, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian [[Duns Scotus]]. Anthony Domestico explains,<blockquote>Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"<ref name=Domestico/></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Windhover]]'' aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n\nI caught this morning morning's minion, king-\n dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind.

It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then [[poet laureate]], published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by [[William Henry Gardner]] appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\n\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in [[Campion Hall, Oxford]]; the [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and the Foley Library at [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://researchguides.gonzaga.edu/c.php?g=67720&p=436824 |title=LibGuides: Manuscript Collections: Hopkins |last=Plowman |first=Stephanie |website=researchguides.gonzaga.edu  |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n====Erotic====\nTimothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met [[Robert Bridges]]'s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian [[Digby Mackworth Dolben]], \"a Christian [[Uranian]]\".<ref>Timothy d'Arch Smith. ''Love in Earnest'', p. 188.</ref> Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.</ref> According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" ''DNB'')</ref> Martin also considers it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdXg7cVBH8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Bernard+Martin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF_-ez_NjOAhUHGR4KHV07D0cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Bernard%20Martin&f=false Martin, Robert Bernard.

Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |title=Joseph Cady ''English Literature: Nineteenth Century'' |access-date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301045049/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |archive-date=1 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again after the latter's short visit to Oxford during which they met, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\"<ref>Michael M.

Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins; now first published, edited with notes by Robert Bridges. London: Humphrey Milford, 1918.</ref> One contemporary critic, M. M. Kaylor, argued for Hopkins's inclusion with the [[Uranian poetry|Uranian poets]], a group whose writings derived, in many ways, from prose works of [[Walter Pater]], Hopkins's academic coach for his Greats exams and later a lifelong friend.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''The Bugler's First Communion,'' Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires''. pp 182\u201393]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''Epithalamion'' in Kaylor ''Secreted Desires'', pp 161\u2013205]</ref><ref>''Victorian Poetry'' 40.2 (2002), pp. 157\u2013187.</ref>\n\nSome critics have argued that homoerotic readings are either highly tendentious, or that they can be classified under the broader category of \"[[homosociality]]\", over the gender, sexual-specific \"homosexual\" term. Hopkins's journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In his book ''Hopkins Reconstructed'' (2000), Justus George Lawler criticises Robert Martin's controversial biography ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'' (1991) by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted [[eisegesis]]\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. Julia Saville's book ''A Queer Chivalry'' views the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins's way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\n\n[[Christopher Ricks]] notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\"<ref name=Ricks/> Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family.<ref name=Ricks/> Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"<ref name=Domestico>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inscape-instress-distress?_ga=1.190997742.596395981.1472016212 Domestico, Anthony. \"Inscape, Instress & Distress\", ''Commonweal'', March 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n====Isolation====\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins's isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings.<ref name=Allbery/> The poem \"To seem the stranger\" was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-seem-the-stranger-lies-my-lot-my-life/ Hopkins, Gerard M. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poemhunter.com]</ref>\n\n==Influence on others==\nRicks called Hopkins \"the most original poet of the Victorian age.\"<ref name=Ricks>[https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-art-and-faith-of-Gerard-Manley-Hopkins-4424 Ricks, Christopher. \"The art and faith of Gerard Manley Hopkins\", ''The New Criterion'', September 1991]</ref> Hopkins is considered as influential as [[T.

He was registered as Thomas Henry Kendall, but never appears to have used his first name. His three volumes of verse were all published under the name of \"Henry Kendall\". His father, Basil Kendall, was the son of the Rev. [[Thomas Kendall]] who came to Sydney in 1809 and five years later went as a missionary to [[New Zealand]].<ref name=adbtkendall>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020039b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography \u2013 Thomas Kendall (1778\u20131832)]</ref>\n\nHe received only a slight education.  When he was 15 he went to sea with one of his uncles on a whaling voyage and was away for about two years. Returning to Sydney when 17 years old he found his mother keeping a boarding-school; it was necessary that he should do something to earn a living, and he became a shop-assistant. He had begun to write verses and this brought him in contact with two well-known verse writers of the day, [[Joseph Sheridan Moore]] who published a volume of verse, ''Spring Life Lyrics'', in 1864, and [[James Lionel Michael]]. Michael, who was a solicitor, took Kendall into his office and gave him the run of his library. He removed to [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]] in 1861 and Kendall was again employed by him for about six months during the following year.<ref name=adbthkendall>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050017b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography \u2013 Thomas Henry Kendall (1839\u20131882)]</ref>\n\nKendall made another friend in [[Henry Parkes]], who was editing ''The Empire'' from 1850 to 1857 and published a few of his youthful verses. In 1862 he sent some poems to the ''London Athenaeum'' which printed three of them and gave the author kindly praise. In the same year his first volume, ''Poems and Songs'', was published at Sydney. It was well received and eventually the whole edition of 500 copies was sold. Representations were made to the government, and in 1863 a position was found for the poet in the lands department. He was transferred to the colonial secretary's department in 1864 and appears to have discharged his duties in a conscientious way; his hours were not long and he had some leisure for literature. His salary, originally \u00a3150 a year, became increased to \u00a3250 and he was able to make a home for his mother and sisters.\n\nIn 1868 he married Charlotte Rutter, the daughter of a Sydney physician, and in the following year resigned from his position in the government service<ref name=adbthkendall/> and went to [[Melbourne]], which had become a larger city than Sydney and more of a literary centre. Kendall's decision to give up his position must at the time have seemed very unwise. But he had become financially embarrassed before his marriage on account of the extravagance of his family, and his wife found it impossible to live with his mother, who had joined the young couple. The elder Mrs Kendall was in fact practically a dipsomaniac, and the poet felt that the only chance of happiness for himself and his wife was to make a fresh start in another city. He was well received by his fellow writers, [[George Gordon McCrae]], [[Marcus Clarke]], [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] and others, but Kendall had none of the qualities of a successful journalist, though some of his work was accepted by the press and [[George Robertson (bookseller)|George Robertson]] published his second volume, ''Leaves from Australian Forests'', soon after his arrival. The poem 'Bell-Birds', one of Australia's best-known poems, was published in that volume. The press notices were favourable, one reviewer in his enthusiasm going so far as to say that \"Swinburne, Arnold and Morris are indulgently treated if we allow them an equal measure of poetic feeling with Kendall\", but comparatively few copies were sold and the publisher made a loss.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref>\n\nThe poet found that he could not make a living by literature and, probably by the good offices of [[George Gordon McCrae]], a temporary position was found for him in the government statist's office. Kendall, however, had no head for figures. He did his best but found his tasks hopeless. One day McCrae was called out into the passage to see Kendall, an agitated, trembling figure who told him he must go, he could not stand it any longer. Years later [[Henry Lawson]] was to write\n\n<blockquote>\"Just as in Southern climes they give<br>\nThe hard-up rhymer figures!\"</blockquote>\n\nKendall had indeed lost heart; he drifted into drinking and [[Alexander Sutherland (educator)|Alexander Sutherland]] in his essay draws a lurid picture of the depths into which the poet had fallen. It is true that he had the authority of Kendall's poem \"On a Street\", but years afterwards George Gordon McCrae told the present writer that Kendall \"made the worst of everything including himself\". McCrae had no doubt about Kendall having at times given way to excessive drinking, but stated positively that he had never actually seen him the worse for drink. McCrae was a good friend to Kendall and he had many other friends in spite of his retiring and sensitive nature. But his friends could not save him from himself, and his two years in Melbourne were among the most miserable of his life. A pathetic letter is still in existence, in which Kendall tells McCrae that he could not go to Gordon's funeral because he was penniless. In December 1870 he was charged with forging and uttering a cheque but found not guilty on the ground of insanity. Unable to support his family, he was forced back to Sydney by poverty, ill health and drunkenness.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> Intervals of dogged literary effort alternated with lapses into melancholia.  His wife had to return to her mother and Kendall became a derelict; in early 1873 he spent four months in the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane.<ref name=adbthkendall/> In November 1873<ref>\"Henry Kendall, The man and the myths\" by Michael Ackland, 1995; \n Michael Wilding, 'Henry Kendall's Recovery at Brisbane Water,' Quadrant, 61, 6, June 2017, 75-82 </ref> Kendall was taken in by the Fagan brothers, timber merchants near Gosford, and was afterwards given a position in the business of one of the brothers, Michael Fagan, at [[Camden Haven]]. There he stayed six years and found again his self-respect. Writing in October 1880 to George Gordon McCrae he said, referring to his employer, \"I want you to know the bearer. He is the man who led me out of Gethsemane and set me in the sunshine\".\n\nIn 1880 he published his third volume, ''Songs from the Mountains''. It was an outstanding success, doing much to re-establish his reputation.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> The volume contained a satirical poem on a politician of the day and had to be withdrawn under threat of a libel action. The original edition is now very rare. The volume was reissued with another poem substituted. In 1881 his old friend Sir Henry Parkes had him appointed inspector of state forests at a salary of \u00a3500 a year. But his health, never strong, broke down due to the required long rides in all weather.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> He caught a severe chill, developed consumption, and died at Redfern in Sydney on 1 August 1882. He was buried in [[Waverley Cemetery]].\n\nHis widow survived him for more than 40 years, and during the last sixteen years of her life received a [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] pension. A posthumous portrait, painted by [[Tom Roberts]], is at the [[National Library of Australia]], Canberra. In 1938 his son, Frederick C. Kendall published ''Henry Kendall, His Later Years'', self-described as \"A Refutation of Mrs Hamilton-Grey's book ''Kendall Our God-made Chief''\".<ref>http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/kendallh/henrykendallppc.html</ref> Kendall's life and friendships are described in Michael Wilding, Wild Bleak Bohemia: Marcus Clarke, Adam Lindsay Gordon and Henry Kendall: A Documentary, Australian Scholarly Publishing, 2014.\n\nIn 1886 a memorial edition of his poems was published at [[Melbourne]]. The small village of [[Kendall, New South Wales|Kendall]] on the [[Mid North Coast]] of [[New South Wales]] is named after him and not, as some suspect, after the similarly-spelled ancient town of [[Kendal]] in the County of Cumbria in England. A street in Elwood, Victoria was also named after him. A street in Campbelltown, Padstow Heights and Heathcote in New South Wales were also named after him. Henry Kendall Street in West Gosford is home to the stone building (now a museum) where he lived for some time with the Fagans also street and a park in Tarrawanna near Wollongong.

He was registered as Thomas Henry Kendall, but never appears to have used his first name. His three volumes of verse were all published under the name of \"Henry Kendall\". His father, Basil Kendall, was the son of the Rev. [[Thomas Kendall]] who came to Sydney in 1809 and five years later went as a missionary to [[New Zealand]].<ref name=adbtkendall>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020039b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography \u2013 Thomas Kendall (1778\u20131832)]</ref>\n\nHe received only a slight education.  When he was 15 he went to sea with one of his uncles on a whaling voyage and was away for about two years. Returning to Sydney when 17 years old he found his mother keeping a boarding-school; it was necessary that he should do something to earn a living, and he became a shop-assistant. He had begun to write verses and this brought him in contact with two well-known verse writers of the day, [[Joseph Sheridan Moore]] who published a volume of verse, ''Spring Life Lyrics'', in 1864, and [[James Lionel Michael]]. Michael, who was a solicitor, took Kendall into his office and gave him the run of his library. He removed to [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]] in 1861 and Kendall was again employed by him for about six months during the following year.<ref name=adbthkendall>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050017b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography \u2013 Thomas Henry Kendall (1839\u20131882)]</ref>\n\nKendall made another friend in [[Henry Parkes]], who was editing ''The Empire'' from 1850 to 1857 and published a few of his youthful verses. In 1862 he sent some poems to the ''London Athenaeum'' which printed three of them and gave the author kindly praise. In the same year his first volume, ''Poems and Songs'', was published at Sydney. It was well received and eventually the whole edition of 500 copies was sold. Representations were made to the government, and in 1863 a position was found for the poet in the lands department. He was transferred to the colonial secretary's department in 1864 and appears to have discharged his duties in a conscientious way; his hours were not long and he had some leisure for literature. His salary, originally \u00a3150 a year, became increased to \u00a3250 and he was able to make a home for his mother and sisters.\n\nIn 1868 he married Charlotte Rutter, the daughter of a Sydney physician, and in the following year resigned from his position in the government service<ref name=adbthkendall/> and went to [[Melbourne]], which had become a larger city than Sydney and more of a literary centre. Kendall's decision to give up his position must at the time have seemed very unwise. But he had become financially embarrassed before his marriage on account of the extravagance of his family, and his wife found it impossible to live with his mother, who had joined the young couple. The elder Mrs Kendall was in fact practically a dipsomaniac, and the poet felt that the only chance of happiness for himself and his wife was to make a fresh start in another city. He was well received by his fellow writers, [[George Gordon McCrae]], [[Marcus Clarke]], [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] and others, but Kendall had none of the qualities of a successful journalist, though some of his work was accepted by the press and [[George Robertson (bookseller)|George Robertson]] published his second volume, ''Leaves from Australian Forests'', soon after his arrival. The poem 'Bell-Birds', one of Australia's best-known poems, was published in that volume. The press notices were favourable, one reviewer in his enthusiasm going so far as to say that \"Swinburne, Arnold and Morris are indulgently treated if we allow them an equal measure of poetic feeling with Kendall\", but comparatively few copies were sold and the publisher made a loss.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref>\n\nThe poet found that he could not make a living by literature and, probably by the good offices of [[George Gordon McCrae]], a temporary position was found for him in the government statist's office. Kendall, however, had no head for figures. He did his best but found his tasks hopeless. One day McCrae was called out into the passage to see Kendall, an agitated, trembling figure who told him he must go, he could not stand it any longer. Years later [[Henry Lawson]] was to write\n\n<blockquote>\"Just as in Southern climes they give<br>\nThe hard-up rhymer figures!\"</blockquote>\n\nKendall had indeed lost heart; he drifted into drinking and [[Alexander Sutherland (educator)|Alexander Sutherland]] in his essay draws a lurid picture of the depths into which the poet had fallen. It is true that he had the authority of Kendall's poem \"On a Street\", but years afterwards George Gordon McCrae told the present writer that Kendall \"made the worst of everything including himself\". McCrae had no doubt about Kendall having at times given way to excessive drinking, but stated positively that he had never actually seen him the worse for drink. McCrae was a good friend to Kendall and he had many other friends in spite of his retiring and sensitive nature. But his friends could not save him from himself, and his two years in Melbourne were among the most miserable of his life. A pathetic letter is still in existence, in which Kendall tells McCrae that he could not go to Gordon's funeral because he was penniless. In December 1870 he was charged with forging and uttering a cheque but found not guilty on the ground of insanity. Unable to support his family, he was forced back to Sydney by poverty, ill health and drunkenness.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> Intervals of dogged literary effort alternated with lapses into melancholia.  His wife had to return to her mother and Kendall became a derelict; in early 1873 he spent four months in the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane.<ref name=adbthkendall/> In November 1873<ref>\"Henry Kendall, The man and the myths\" by Michael Ackland, 1995</ref> Kendall was taken in by the Fagan brothers, timber merchants near Gosford, and was afterwards given a position in the business of one of the brothers, Michael Fagan, at [[Camden Haven]]. There he stayed six years and found again his self-respect. Writing in October 1880 to George Gordon McCrae he said, referring to his employer, \"I want you to know the bearer. He is the man who led me out of Gethsemane and set me in the sunshine\".\n\nIn 1880 he published his third volume, ''Songs from the Mountains''. It was an outstanding success, doing much to re-establish his reputation.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> The volume contained a satirical poem on a politician of the day and had to be withdrawn under threat of a libel action. The original edition is now very rare. The volume was reissued with another poem substituted. In 1881 his old friend Sir Henry Parkes had him appointed inspector of state forests at a salary of \u00a3500 a year. But his health, never strong, broke down due to the required long rides in all weather.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kendall-thomas-henry-3941</ref> He caught a severe chill, developed consumption, and died at Redfern in Sydney on 1 August 1882. He was buried in [[Waverley Cemetery]].\n\nHis widow survived him for more than 40 years, and during the last sixteen years of her life received a [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] pension. A posthumous portrait, painted by [[Tom Roberts]], is at the [[National Library of Australia]], Canberra. In 1938 his son, Frederick C. Kendall published ''Henry Kendall, His Later Years'', self-described as \"A Refutation of Mrs Hamilton-Grey's book ''Kendall Our God-made Chief''\".<ref>http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/kendallh/henrykendallppc.html</ref>\n\nIn 1886 a memorial edition of his poems was published at [[Melbourne]]. The small village of [[Kendall, New South Wales|Kendall]] on the [[Mid North Coast]] of [[New South Wales]] is named after him and not, as some suspect, after the similarly-spelled ancient town of [[Kendal]] in the County of Cumbria in England. A street in Elwood, Victoria was also named after him. A street in Campbelltown, Padstow Heights and Heathcote in New South Wales were also named after him. Henry Kendall Street in West Gosford is home to the stone building (now a museum) where he lived for some time with the Fagans also street and a park in Tarrawanna near Wollongong. A retirement village in [[Wyoming, New South Wales]] is also named in his honour, named Henry Kendall Gardens ( formally Henry Kendall Village )\n.\n\nThe biennial Henry Kendall Poetry Award.<ref>[http://www.centralcoastpoets.com.au Link text].

Nash had already mentioned Butler in his ''Collections for a History of Worcestershire'' (1781), and perhaps because the latter date seemed to be a revised account, it has been repeated by many writers and editors. However, The parish register of Strensham records under the year 1612: \"Item was christened Samuell Butler the sonne of Samuell Butler the xiiijth of February anno ut supra\". [[Lady Day]], 25 March, was New Year's Day in England at the time, so the year of his baptism was 1613 according to the change of the start of the year with the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|Calendar Act of 1750]] (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]]).<ref name=\"wilding\"/> Nash also claims in his 1793 edition of ''Hudibras'' that Butler's father entered his son's baptism into the register, an error that was also repeated in later publications; however, the entry was clearly written by a different hand.<ref name=\"wilding\"/>\n\nButler was brought up in the household of [[Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet, of Wytley|Sir William Russell]] of Strensham and became his clerk.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=149}} \"When just a Boy he would make observations and reflections on every Thing one sayd or did, and censure it to be either well or ill.

In early youth he was a servant to the [[Elizabeth Grey, Countess of Kent|Countess of Kent]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=66}} Through Lady Kent he met her steward, the jurist [[John Selden]] who influenced his later writings.  He also tried his hand at painting but was reportedly not very good at it; one of his editors reporting that \"his pictures served to stop windows and save the tax\" ([[Window tax|on window glass]]). Conversely, John Aubrey who knew Butler quite well enough to be one of his pallbearers, wrote that \"He was thinking once to have made painting his Profession.

The poem was very popular in its time, and several of its phrases have passed into the dictionary. It was sufficiently popular to spawn imitators. ''Hudibras'' takes some of its characterization from ''[[Don Quixote]]'' but, unlike that work, it has many more references to personalities and events of the day.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=66}} Butler was also influenced by satirists such as [[John Skelton]] and [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''[[Virgile travesti]]''; a satire on classical literature, particularly [[Virgil]].<ref>Butler, Samuel, ''Hudibras: The Second Part'', London 1663.

Two of the more noteworthy editions are those edited by Zachery Grey (1744) and [[Treadway Russell Nash]] (1793). The standard edition of the work was edited by John Wilders (1967).\n\n==Other writings==\nMost of his other writings never saw print until they were collected and published by [[Robert Thyer]] in 1759. Butler wrote many short [[biography|biographies]], [[epigram]]s and verses the earliest surviving from 1644.  Of his verses, the best known is \"The Elephant on the Moon\", about a [[mouse]] trapped in a [[telescope]], a [[satire]] on [[Paul Neale|Sir Paul Neale]] of the [[Royal Society]].  Butler's taste for the [[mock heroic]] is shown by another early poem ''Cynarctomachy'', or Battle between Bear and Dogs, which is both a homage to and a parody of a Greek poem ascribed to [[Homer]], ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]''. \nHe wrote the poem ''Upon Philip Nye's Thanksgiving Beard''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=899641001&objectId=3315139&partId=1|title=Image gallery: Philip Nye's Thanksgiving Beard|website=British Museum|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Samuel Butler, The Genuine Poetical Remains, page 175</ref> about the Puritan [[Philip Nye]] and later also mentioned him in ''[[Hudibras]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45401|title=Acton - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis supposed lack of money later in life is strange as he had numerous unpublished works which could have offered him income including a set of [[Theophrastus|Theophrastan]] character sketches which were not printed until 1759.

Nash had already mentioned Butler in his ''Collections for a History of Worcestershire'' (1781), and perhaps because the latter date seemed to be a revised account, it has been repeated by many writers and editors. However, The parish register of Strensham records under the year 1612: \"Item was christened Samuell Butler the sonne of Samuell Butler the xiiijth of February anno ut supra\". [[Lady Day]], 25 March, was New Year's Day in England at the time, so the year of his baptism was 1613 according to the change of the start of the year with the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|Calendar Act of 1750]] (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]]).<ref name=\"wilding\"/> Nash also claims in his 1793 edition of ''Hudibras'' that Butler's father entered his son's baptism into the register, an error that was also repeated in later publications; however, the entry was clearly written by a different hand.<ref name=\"wilding\"/>\n\nButler was brought up in the household of [[Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet, of Wytley|Sir William Russell]] of Strensham and became his clerk.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=149}} \"When just a Boy he would make observations and reflections on every Thing one sayd or did, and censure it to be either well or ill.

In early youth he was a servant to the [[Elizabeth Grey, Countess of Kent|Countess of Kent]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=66}} Through Lady Kent he met her steward, the jurist [[John Selden]] who influenced his later writings.  He also tried his hand at painting but was reportedly not very good at it; one of his editors reporting that \"his pictures served to stop windows and save the tax\" ([[Window tax|on window glass]]). Conversely, John Aubrey who knew Butler quite well enough to be one of his pallbearers, wrote that \"He was thinking once to have made painting his Profession.

The poem was very popular in its time, and several of its phrases have passed into the dictionary. It was sufficiently popular to spawn imitators. ''Hudibras'' takes some of its characterization from ''[[Don Quixote]]'' but, unlike that work, it has many more references to personalities and events of the day.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=66}} Butler was also influenced by satirists such as [[John Skelton]] and [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''[[Virgile travesti]]''; a satire on classical literature, particularly [[Virgil]].<ref>Butler, Samuel, ''Hudibras: The Second Part'', London 1663.

Two of the more noteworthy editions are those edited by Zachery Grey (1744) and [[Treadway Russell Nash]] (1793). The standard edition of the work was edited by John Wilders (1967).\n\n==Other writings==\nMost of his other writings never saw print until they were collected and published by [[Robert Thyer]] in 1759. Butler wrote many short [[biography|biographies]], [[epigram]]s and verses the earliest surviving from 1644.  Of his verses, the best known is \"The Elephant on the Moon\", about a [[mouse]] trapped in a [[telescope]], a [[satire]] on [[Paul Neale|Sir Paul Neale]] of the [[Royal Society]].  Butler's taste for the [[mock heroic]] is shown by another early poem ''Cynarctomachy'', or Battle between Bear and Dogs, which is both a homage to and a parody of a Greek poem ascribed to [[Homer]], ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]''. \nHe wrote the poem ''Upon Philip Nye's Thanksgiving Beard''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=899641001&objectId=3315139&partId=1|title=Image gallery: Philip Nye's Thanksgiving Beard|website=British Museum|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Samuel Butler, The Genuine Poetical Remains, page 175</ref> about the Puritan [[Philip Nye]] and later also mentioned him in ''[[Hudibras]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45401|title=Acton - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis supposed lack of money later in life is strange as he had numerous unpublished works which could have offered him income including a set of [[Theophrastus|Theophrastan]] character sketches which were not printed until 1759.

He was born in [[Melbourne]], but spent his formative years in [[Brisbane]]. He was the eldest son of [[Norman Lindsay]] and brother of author [[Philip Lindsay]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nLindsay was educated at [[Brisbane Grammar School]] and the [[University of Queensland]], from which he graduated with first class honours in Greek and Latin.<ref name=\"Gillen\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lindsay-john-jack-14177 Gillen, Paul.

Lindsay described that experience later in the autobiographical work ''Fanfrolico and After'' (1962).<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> He moved to the left politically, writing for ''Left Review'' and joining the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] at the end of the decade, becoming an activist. He started writing novels while living in [[Cornwall]]. Lindsay's earliest novels were set in [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire]]; they included ''Cressida's First Lover'' (1931), ''Rome For Sale'' and ''Caesar Is Dead'' (both 1934).<ref>[[Michael Cox (novelist)|Michael Cox]] and Jack Adrian, ''The Oxford Book of Historical Stories''.
