{"title_page": "Manuel Gamio", "text_new": "[[Image:Manuel Gamio.jpg|thumb|right|Manuel Gamio]]\n'''Manuel Gamio''' (1883\u20131960) was a Mexican [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], and a leader of the ''[[indigenismo]]'' movement. Although he rejected full sovereignty for indigenous communities in Mexico, he argued that their self-governing organizations, such as tribal governments, municipal organizations, and elected community leaders should be recognized and respected.<ref name=\"Gamio1942\" /> He is often considered as the father of modern anthropological studies in [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" /> He devised a well-known system for classifying the [[hunter-gatherer]]s of Central America.\n\n==Education==\nGamio was born in [[Mexico City]], where he studied engineering at the School of Mining. However, at age 19 he left his studies to work on a family rubber plantation, where the states of [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]] join. There he learned [[Nahuatl]] from the plantation workers and developed a strong interest in [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico's indigenous cultures]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" />\n\nHe returned to study at the National Museum under [[Z\u00e9lia Nuttall]], who in 1909 sent him to study under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" /> There he earned a Ph.D. From Boas he adopted the cultural approach characteristic of the anthropology of the United States in the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Darnell2001\" /> Boas considered Gamio one of his best students.\n\n==Work in Mexico and Guatemala==\n[[File:Templo Mayor 2015 126.jpg|thumb|right|Statue at Templo Mayor, Mexico City]]\nHe returned to Mexico in 1910 and the following year he was among the founders of the [[International School of American Archeology and Ethnology in Mexico|Escuela Internacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda Americana (International School of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Americas)]] in Mexico City, with funds obtained from Germany and the United States. Other individuals associated with the school included [[Eduard Seler]], [[Alfred M. Tozzer]] and Boas. This was during the [[Mexican Revolution]], and thus was a difficult time to establish new scientific institutions. Gamio was director of the school from 1916 through 1920, when it closed for lack of funds.\n\nIn 1911 he established a ceramic sequence for the [[Valley of Mexico]] based on earlier stratigraphic excavations at [[Azcapotzalco]], [[Mexican Federal District|Distrito Federal]]. Between 1913 and 1916 he was inspector general of archaeological monuments of the [[Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica|Mexican Ministry of Public Education]]. He performed field work at various places in the Valley of Mexico, including [[Copilco]], [[Cuicuilco]] and the [[Templo Mayor]] (all in the Distrito Federal); Chalchihuites, Zacatecas; [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]; [[Ecuador]] and Miraflores, Guatemala.\n\nHe was the first scientific investigator to explore [[Teotihuacan]]. A result of these investigations was the book ''La poblaci\u00f3n del valle de Teotihuacan'' (The Population of the Valley of Teotihuacan), published in 1922. A revision of his Columbia thesis, this work is still an important source for ethnographic information on the northern zone of the [[Mexico (state)|State of Mexico]]. He also produced some documentary films. He estimated the maximum population of Teotihuacan at 300,000.<ref name=\"Goliath\" /> He criticized the Mexican census for classifying Spanish-speaking Indians as whites and those married by traditional rites as single.\n\nEarlier, in 1916, he had published the important book ''Forjando patria: pro nacionalismo'' (Mexico City: Libreria de Porr\u00faa Hermanos) (Forging a Fatherland), a treatise on [[cultural assimilation]] of indigenous Mexicans into the racially mixed society of the country. Other works in Spanish include ''Hacia un M\u00e9xico nuevo'' (1935) and ''Consideraciones sobre el problema del indigenismo'' (1948).\n\nIn the 1920s he investigated the highlands of [[Guatemala]], near the cities of [[Quiche]], [[Huehuetenango]] and [[Quetzaltenango]], concentrating on pottery styles. Due to the similarity of pottery from Guatemala and central Mexico, Gamio believed the latter area to be the original source of Mayan civilization. He hypothesized that some of the early natives of central Mexico abandoned that area in search of a place free of earthquakes and volcanos.<ref name=\"ScienceNews\" />\n\nGamio's publications on Mexico's indigenous was important for \"reinstating [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]] as the glorious foundation of Mexican history and culture.\"<ref name=\"Brading\" /> Gamio was one among many, including President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] in the 1930s, who worked for the integration of the indigenous into national life.<ref name=\"Lacy\" />\n\n==Work in the United States==\nIn 1925 he emigrated to the United States after denouncing corruption in the Mexican Ministry of Education. He concentrated on the subjects of migration and labor involving Mexicans in the United States, for the [[Social Science Research Council]] in Washington, D.C. Gamio published two books on this research \u2013  ''Mexican Immigration to the United States'' (1930) and ''The Mexican Immigrant: His Life Story'' (1931) \u2013 this time in English. These books have only recently been translated into Spanish for the use of present-day Mexican anthropologists and sociologists.<ref name=\"Review\" />\n\nHe returned to Mexico in 1930, where he held various government positions, conducted sociological and applied anthropological investigations, and directed the [[Inter-American Indian Institute]] from its foundation in 1942 until his death in 1960.<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Gamio1942\">{{cite journal | last=Gamio | first= Manuel |date=October 1942 | title=Calificacion de Caracteristicas Culturales de los Grupos Indigenas | journal=America Indigena | location=Mexico, DF: Instituto Indigenista Interamericano | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=17\u201322}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ScienceNews\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arch/9_21_96/timeline.htm | title=Ancient Mayas Studied Earthquakes; Sought Land Free From Them for Home | publisher=The Science News-Letter | date=18 September 1926}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Brading\">{{cite journal | author=[[David Brading|D.A.

Although he rejected full sovereignty for indigenous communities in Mexico, he argued that their self-governing organizations, such as tribal governments, municipal organizations, and elected community leaders should be recognized and respected.<ref name=\"Gamio1942\" /> He is often considered as the father of modern anthropological studies in [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" /> He devised a well-known system for classifying the [[hunter-gatherer]]s of Central America.\n\n==Education==\nGamio was born in [[Mexico City]], where he studied engineering at the School of Mining. However, at age 19 he left his studies to work on a family rubber plantation, where the states of [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]] join. There he learned [[Nahuatl]] from the plantation workers and developed a strong interest in [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico's indigenous cultures]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" />\n\nHe returned to study at the National Museum under [[Z\u00e9lia Nuttall]], who in 1909 sent him to study under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" /> There he earned a Ph.D. From Boas he adopted the cultural approach characteristic of the anthropology of the United States in the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Darnell2001\" /> Boas considered Gamio one of his best students.\n\n==Work in Mexico and Guatemala==\n[[File:Templo Mayor 2015 126.jpg|thumb|right|Statue at Templo Mayor, Mexico City]]\nHe returned to Mexico in 1910 and the following year he was among the founders of the [[International School of American Archeology and Ethnology in Mexico|Escuela Internacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda Americana (International School of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Americas)]] in Mexico City, with funds obtained from Germany and the United States. Other individuals associated with the school included [[Eduard Seler]], [[Alfred M. Tozzer]] and Boas. This was during the [[Mexican Revolution]], and thus was a difficult time to establish new scientific institutions. Gamio was director of the school from 1916 through 1920, when it closed for lack of funds.\n\nIn 1911 he established a ceramic sequence for the [[Valley of Mexico]] based on earlier stratigraphic excavations at [[Azcapotzalco]], [[Mexican Federal District|Distrito Federal]]. Between 1913 and 1916 he was inspector general of archaeological monuments of the [[Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica|Mexican Ministry of Public Education]]. He performed field work at various places in the Valley of Mexico, including [[Copilco]], [[Cuicuilco]] and the [[Templo Mayor]] (all in the Distrito Federal); Chalchihuites, Zacatecas; [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]; [[Ecuador]] and Miraflores, Guatemala.\n\nHe was the first scientific investigator to explore [[Teotihuacan]]. A result of these investigations was the book ''La poblaci\u00f3n del valle de Teotihuacan'' (The Population of the Valley of Teotihuacan), published in 1922. A revision of his Columbia thesis, this work is still an important source for ethnographic information on the northern zone of the [[Mexico (state)|State of Mexico]]. He also produced some documentary films. He estimated the maximum population of Teotihuacan at 300,000.<ref name=\"Goliath\" /> He criticized the Mexican census for classifying Spanish-speaking Indians as whites and those married by traditional rites as single.\n\nEarlier, in 1916, he had published the important book ''Forjando patria: pro nacionalismo'' (Mexico City: Libreria de Porr\u00faa Hermanos) (Forging a Fatherland), a treatise on [[cultural assimilation]] of indigenous Mexicans into the racially mixed society of the country. Other works in Spanish include ''Hacia un M\u00e9xico nuevo'' (1935) and ''Consideraciones sobre el problema del indigenismo'' (1948).\n\nIn the 1920s he investigated the highlands of [[Guatemala]], near the cities of [[Quiche]], [[Huehuetenango]] and [[Quetzaltenango]], concentrating on pottery styles. Due to the similarity of pottery from Guatemala and central Mexico, Gamio believed the latter area to be the original source of Mayan civilization. He hypothesized that some of the early natives of central Mexico abandoned that area in search of a place free of earthquakes and volcanos.<ref name=\"ScienceNews\" />\n\nGamio's publications on Mexico's indigenous was important for \"reinstating [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]] as the glorious foundation of Mexican history and culture.\"<ref name=\"Brading\" /> Gamio was one among many, including President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] in the 1930s, who worked for the integration of the indigenous into national life.<ref name=\"Lacy\" />\n\n==Work in the United States==\nIn 1925 he emigrated to the United States after denouncing corruption in the Mexican Ministry of Education. He concentrated on the subjects of migration and labor involving Mexicans in the United States, for the [[Social Science Research Council]] in Washington, D.C. Gamio published two books on this research \u2013  ''Mexican Immigration to the United States'' (1930) and ''The Mexican Immigrant: His Life Story'' (1931) \u2013 this time in English. These books have only recently been translated into Spanish for the use of present-day Mexican anthropologists and sociologists.<ref name=\"Review\" />\n\nHe returned to Mexico in 1930, where he held various government positions, conducted sociological and applied anthropological investigations, and directed the [[Inter-American Indian Institute]] from its foundation in 1942 until his death in 1960.<ref name=\"Galliard2004\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Gamio1942\">{{cite journal | last=Gamio | first= Manuel |date=October 1942 | title=Calificacion de Caracteristicas Culturales de los Grupos Indigenas | journal=America Indigena | location=Mexico, DF: Instituto Indigenista Interamericano | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=17\u201322}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ScienceNews\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arch/9_21_96/timeline.htm | title=Ancient Mayas Studied Earthquakes; Sought Land Free From Them for Home | publisher=The Science News-Letter | date=18 September 1926}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Brading\">{{cite journal | author=[[David Brading|D.A.
