The generic name bestowed by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] posthumously honoured the Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] (1662\u20131715), an English [[botanist]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], at the suggestion of Dr. [[William Houstoun (botanist)|William Houstoun]]. Houstoun sent the first plants to become known to science as buddleja ([[Buddleja americana|''B. americana'']]) to England from the Caribbean about 15 years after Buddle's death.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe botanic name has been the source of some confusion. By modern practice of [[botanical Latin]], the spelling of a generic name made from 'Buddle' would be ''Buddleia'', but [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' of 1753 and 1754 spelled it ''Buddleja'', with the long i between two vowels, common in early modern orthography.<ref name=Linnaei>Linnaei, C. (1753). ''Species plantarum''. Impensis Laurentii Salvii, [[Stockholm]].</ref> The pronunciation of the long i in ''Buddleja'' as ''j'' is a common modern error. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] has gradually changed to incorporate stricter rules about [[orthographic variant]]s and as of the 2006 edition requires (article 60, particularly 60.5) that Linnaeus' spelling should be followed in this case.<ref name=\"MelbourneCode\">{{Citation |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Barrie |editor2-first=F.

Both [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous]] species occur, in tropical and temperate regions resp. The [[leaf|leaves]] are lanceolate in most species, and arranged in opposite pairs on the stems (alternate in one species, ''[[Buddleja alternifolia|B. alternifolia]]''); they range from {{convert|1|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s of the Asiatic species are mostly produced in terminal [[panicle]]s {{convert|10|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; the American species more commonly as cymes forming small, globose heads. Each individual flower is tubular and divided into four spreading lobes ([[petal]]s) about {{convert|3|-|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} across, the [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] length ranging from around 10&nbsp;mm in the Asiatics to 3\u201330&nbsp;mm in the American species, the wider variation in the latter because some South American species have evolved long red flowers to attract [[hummingbird]]s, rather than insects, as exclusive [[pollinator]]s.\n\nThe colour of the flowers varies widely, from mostly pastel pinks and blues in Asia, to vibrant yellows and reds in the New World, while many cultivars have deeper tones.  The flowers are generally rich in [[nectar]] and often strongly honey-scented.  The [[fruit]] is a small [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter, containing numerous small [[seed]]s; in a few species (previously classified in the separate genus ''Nicodemia'') the capsule is soft and fleshy, forming a [[berry (botany)|berry]].\n\n==Distribution==\nThe genus is found in four continents. Over 60 species are [[native plant|native]] through the New World from the southern United States south to Chile, while many other species are found in the Old World, in Africa, and parts of Asia, but all are absent as natives from Europe and Australasia. The species are divided into three groups based on their floral type: those in the New World are mostly [[plant sexuality|dioecious]] (occasionally [[plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]] or [[plant sexuality|trioecious]]), while those in the Old World are exclusively hermaphrodite with [[perfect flower|perfect]] flowers.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nAs garden shrubs buddlejas are essentially 20th-century plants, with the exception of ''[[Buddleja globosa|B. globosa]]'' which was introduced to Britain from southern Chile in 1774 and disseminated from the nursery of [[Lee and Kennedy]], Hammersmith.<ref>Alice M. Coats, ''Garden Shrubs and Their Histories'' (1964) 1992, ''s.v.'' \"Buddleia\".</ref> Several species are popular garden plants, the species are commonly known as 'butterfly bushes' owing to their attractiveness to [[butterflies]], and have become staples of the modern [[butterfly garden]]; they are also attractive to [[bee]]s and [[moth]]s.\n\nThe most popular cultivated species is ''[[Buddleja davidii]]'' from central China, named for the French [[Basque people|Basque]] missionary and naturalist P\u00e8re [[Armand David]]. Other common garden species include the aforementioned ''B. globosa'', grown for its strongly honey-scented orange globular [[inflorescences]], and the weeping ''[[Buddleja alternifolia]]''. Several interspecific [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been made, notably [[Buddleja 'Lochinch'|''B.'' 'Lochinch']] (''B. davidii'' \u00d7 [[Buddleja fallowiana|''B. fallowiana'']]) and [[Buddleja \u00d7 weyeriana|''B. \u00d7 weyeriana'']] (''B. globosa'' \u00d7 ''B. davidii''), the latter a cross between a South American and an Asiatic species.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSome species commonly escape from the garden. ''B. davidii'' in particular is a great coloniser of dry open ground; in urban areas in the United Kingdom, it often self-sows on waste ground or old masonry, where it grows into a dense thicket, and is listed as an [[invasive species]] in many areas. It is frequently seen beside railway lines, on derelict factory sites and, in the aftermath of World War II, on urban bomb sites. This earned it the popular nickname of 'the bombsite plant' among the war-time generation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPopular garden cultivars include [[Buddleja davidii 'Royal Red'|'Royal Red']] (reddish-purple flowers), [[Buddleja davidii 'Black Knight'|'Black Knight']] (very dark purple), [[Buddleja \u00d7 weyeriana 'Sungold'|'Sungold']] (golden yellow), and [[Buddleja 'Pink Delight'|'Pink Delight']] (pure pink). In recent years, much breeding work has been undertaken to create small, more compact buddlejas, such as [[Buddleja 'Blue Chip'|'Blue Chip']] which reach no more than {{convert|2|-|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, and which are also seed sterile, an important consideration in the USA where ''B. davidii'' and its cultivars are banned from many states owing to their invasiveness.\n\n==Buddleja collections==\nIn Britain, there are four [[National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens]] collections, held by:\n*The Lavender Garden, Ashcroft Nurseries, Kingscote, Tetbury, Glos.

The generic name bestowed by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] posthumously honoured the Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] (1662\u20131715), an English [[botanist]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], at the suggestion of Dr. [[William Houstoun (botanist)|William Houstoun]]. Houstoun sent the first plants to become known to science as buddleja ([[Buddleja americana|''B. americana'']]) to England from the Caribbean about 15 years after Buddle's death.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe botanic name has been the source of some confusion. By modern practice of [[botanical Latin]], the spelling of a generic name made from 'Buddle' would be ''Buddleia'', but [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' of 1753 and 1754 spelled it ''Buddleja'', with the long i between two vowels, common in early modern orthography.<ref name=Linnaei>Linnaei, C. (1753). ''Species plantarum''. Impensis Laurentii Salvii, [[Stockholm]].</ref> The pronunciation of the long i in ''Buddleja'' as ''j'' is a common modern error. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] has gradually changed to incorporate stricter rules about [[orthographic variant]]s and as of the 2006 edition requires (article 60, particularly 60.5) that Linnaeus' spelling should be followed in this case.<ref name=\"MelbourneCode\">{{Citation |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Barrie |editor2-first=F.

Both [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous]] species occur, in tropical and temperate regions resp. The [[leaf|leaves]] are lanceolate in most species, and arranged in opposite pairs on the stems (alternate in one species, ''[[Buddleja alternifolia|B. alternifolia]]''); they range from {{convert|1|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s of the Asiatic species are mostly produced in terminal [[panicle]]s {{convert|10|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; the American species more commonly as cymes forming small, globose heads. Each individual flower is tubular and divided into four spreading lobes ([[petal]]s) about {{convert|3|-|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} across, the [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] length ranging from around 10&nbsp;mm in the Asiatics to 3\u201330&nbsp;mm in the American species, the wider variation in the latter because some South American species have evolved long red flowers to attract [[hummingbird]]s, rather than insects, as exclusive [[pollinator]]s.\n\nThe colour of the flowers varies widely, from mostly pastel pinks and blues in Asia, to vibrant yellows and reds in the New World, while many cultivars have deeper tones.  The flowers are generally rich in [[nectar]] and often strongly honey-scented.  The [[fruit]] is a small [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter, containing numerous small [[seed]]s; in a few species (previously classified in the separate genus ''Nicodemia'') the capsule is soft and fleshy, forming a [[berry (botany)|berry]].\n\n==Distribution==\nThe genus is found in four continents. Over 60 species are [[native plant|native]] through the New World from the southern United States south to Chile, while many other species are found in the Old World, in Africa, and parts of Asia, but all are absent as natives from Europe and Australasia. The species are divided into three groups based on their floral type: those in the New World are mostly [[plant sexuality|dioecious]] (occasionally [[plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]] or [[plant sexuality|trioecious]]), while those in the Old World are exclusively hermaphrodite with [[perfect flower|perfect]] flowers.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nAs garden shrubs buddlejas are essentially 20th-century plants, with the exception of ''[[Buddleja globosa|B. globosa]]'' which was introduced to Britain from southern Chile in 1774 and disseminated from the nursery of [[Lee and Kennedy]], Hammersmith.<ref>Alice M. Coats, ''Garden Shrubs and Their Histories'' (1964) 1992, ''s.v.'' \"Buddleia\".</ref> Several species are popular garden plants, the species are commonly known as 'butterfly bushes' owing to their attractiveness to [[butterflies]], and have become staples of the modern [[butterfly garden]]; they are also attractive to [[bee]]s and [[moth]]s.\n\nThe most popular cultivated species is ''[[Buddleja davidii]]'' from central China, named for the French [[Basque people|Basque]] missionary and naturalist P\u00e8re [[Armand David]]. Other common garden species include the aforementioned ''B. globosa'', grown for its strongly honey-scented orange globular [[inflorescences]], and the weeping ''[[Buddleja alternifolia]]''. Several interspecific [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been made, notably [[Buddleja 'Lochinch'|''B.'' 'Lochinch']] (''B. davidii'' \u00d7 [[Buddleja fallowiana|''B. fallowiana'']]) and [[Buddleja \u00d7 weyeriana|''B. \u00d7 weyeriana'']] (''B. globosa'' \u00d7 ''B. davidii''), the latter a cross between a South American and an Asiatic species.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSome species commonly escape from the garden. ''B. davidii'' in particular is a great coloniser of dry open ground; in urban areas in the United Kingdom, it often self-sows on waste ground or old masonry, where it grows into a dense thicket, and is listed as an [[invasive species]] in many areas. It is frequently seen beside railway lines, on derelict factory sites and, in the aftermath of World War II, on urban bomb sites. This earned it the popular nickname of 'the bombsite plant' among the war-time generation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPopular garden cultivars include [[Buddleja davidii 'Royal Red'|'Royal Red']] (reddish-purple flowers), [[Buddleja davidii 'Black Knight'|'Black Knight']] (very dark purple), [[Buddleja \u00d7 weyeriana 'Sungold'|'Sungold']] (golden yellow), and [[Buddleja 'Pink Delight'|'Pink Delight']] (pure pink). In recent years, much breeding work has been undertaken to create small, more compact buddlejas, such as [[Buddleja 'Blue Chip'|'Blue Chip']] which reach no more than {{convert|2|-|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, and which are also seed sterile, an important consideration in the USA where ''B. davidii'' and its cultivars are banned from many states owing to their invasiveness.\n\n==Buddleja collections==\nIn Britain, there are four [[National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens]] collections, held by:\n*The Lavender Garden, Ashcroft Nurseries, Kingscote, Tetbury, Glos.

He also briefly served as the temporary president in April 1952, and as [[Vice President of Bolivia|vice president]] between 1952 and 1956.\n\n==Early life==\nHern\u00e1n Siles was the illegitimate son of the last [[Republican Party (Bolivia)|Republican Party]] president of Bolivia, [[Hernando Siles Reyes|Hernando Siles]] and Isabel Zuazo Cusicanqui. Siles was raised by his mother. His half-brother [[Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas]] was President for five months in 1969.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref>\n\nIn 1931 Siles graduated from the American Institute in La Paz. He served in Bolivian army and was decorated for injury sustained while fighting in the [[Chaco War]] of 1932-35. After the war he finished San Andres University with a degree in law.\n\nSiles was married to Maria Teresa Ormachea del Carpio and had three daughters, Marcela, Ana Maria and Isabel.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref>\n\n==Formation of the MNR and the 1952 Revolution==\n{{see also|Bolivian National Revolution}}\nIn 1940 Siles was elected in the Chamber of Deputies. Gravitating toward the reformist side of the political spectrum (even though his father had been one of the pillars of the Old Regime), in 1941 he founded along with [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] and others, the influential [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, or MNR).\n\nThe MNR was behind the coup that installed the progressive military administration of [[Gualberto Villarroel]] (1943\u201346), but was forced from power due to U.S. pressure and also by Villarroel's overthrow in 1946 after which Siles was exiled to Argentina. There he worked as a correspondent for [[Associated Press]] from November 1947 until September 1948.\n\nIn the [[1951 Bolivian general election|1951 elections]] Paz Estenssoro run for presidency with Siles as his vice-presidential running mate, and won the contest with 42.9% of the vote. However, the ultra-conservative government of [[Mamerto Urriolagoit\u00eda]] refused to recognize the results and instead turned over the presidency to the commander of the Bolivian army, general [[Hugo Ballivi\u00e1n]]. At that point the MNR party went underground and in April 9\u201311, 1952 led the historic [[Bolivian National Revolution]], aided by defections from the armed forces to the rebel cause (key among which was general Antonio Seleme). Siles played a major role in the revolutionary uprising, along with [[Juan Lech\u00edn]], since the MNR leader Paz Estenssoro was at the time in exile in Argentina.\n\n==Vice-President, 1952-56==\nHaving defeated the military and toppled the Ballivi\u00e1n government, Siles served as provisional president from 11 April 1952 until 16 April 1952, when Estenssoro returned from exile. The 1951 electoral results were upheld, and Paz Estenssoro became constitutional president of Bolivia with Siles as his vice-president.<ref>[http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.bo/Vicepresidencia/GaleriaVicepresidencial/19131956/tabid/81/Default.aspx Vicepresidency of Bolivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030956/http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.bo/Vicepresidencia/GaleriaVicepresidencial/19131956/tabid/81/Default.aspx |date=16 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the MNR's first 4 years in the office, the government instituted far-reaching reforms, including the establishment of the universal vote, nationalization of the largest mining concerns in the country, and the adoption of a major agrarian reform. In 1956 Estenssoro left the office, as the Bolivian Constitution forbade a sitting president from running for another consecutive term. Siles, his logical successor, easily won the [[1956 Bolivian general election|elections of 1956]] and became President of the Republic on August 6, 1956.\n\n==First Presidency 1956-60==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo, Presidente da Bol\u00edvia..tif|thumb|Hern\u00e1n Zuazo, 1956. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nThe first Siles' administration was more contentious and difficult than revolutionary Estenssoro's had been. During this time MNR began to fragment along personal lines and due to growing disagreements over policy.\n\nEconomy was in deep trouble, as food and minerals production had plummeted, inflation soared, and the United States conditioned any aid and further support on the adoption of an economic program of its own prescription (the so-called ''[[Eder plan]]'') in late 1956 under which Siles accepted USA aid in return for cutting government expenses and social programs.\n\nSiles also had to tackle the difficult issue of disarming the worker and miner militia members who had fought in the 1952 Revolution and who had been allowed to keep their weapons. They had served as a useful counterbalance to the possibility of a conservative or military coup against the Revolution, but were by now serving the growing ambitions of the head of the [[Bolivian Workers' Center]] (COB) [[Juan Lech\u00edn]]. Meanwhile, the [[Falange Socialista Boliviana]] party schemed to topple the MNR from power, causing a rather disproportionate repressive backlash that diminished MNR's (and Siles') popularity.\n\n==Break with the MNR and exile, 1960-78==\nAfter the end of Siles' term in 1960, Estenssoro again ran for president in [[1960 Bolivian general election|1960 elections]] and, upon being elected, sent Siles as ambassador to Uruguay until 1963 and as ambassador to Spain (1963\u201364). In 1964 Siles broke with Estrassoro over the latter's decision to run for another consecutive term.\n\nSiles initially supported the [[1964 Bolivian coup d'\u00e9tat|November 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat]] by vice-president, General [[Ren\u00e9 Barrientos]] and army chief [[Alfredo Ovando]] \u2014 but was later exiled when it became apparent that the military intended to manipulate 1966 electoral results to perpetuate itself in power. Except for a five-month interlude during which his half-brother held the presidency, the armed forces remained in control of the Presidential [[Palacio Quemado]] until 1982.\n\nIn 1971 Siles opposed the right-wing coup of general [[Hugo Banzer]], prompting an irreversible break with Estenssoro, who supported the coup. In 1971 Siles formed the [[Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario de Izquierda'', MNRI), beginning a steady leftwards drift.\n\n==The 1978-82 democratic false starts==\nAfter the 1978 democratic opening, Siles returned to Bolivia and formed a grand alliance of the left with the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria, the Communist Party, and others. Together, they formed the [[Unidad Democr\u00e1tica y Popular]] (UDP), which triumphed in the [[1978 Bolivian general election|1978]], [[1979 Bolivian general election|1979]], and [[1980 Bolivian general election|1980]] general elections, mostly as a result of a serious erosion of support for Estenssoro.\n\nThe 1978 election was annulled due to massive fraud in favor of the official military candidate, General [[Juan Pereda]], though exit polls showed Siles would have won handily had the election been conducted honestly. The 1979 contest remained inconclusive because no candidate received 50% of the vote, and Congress elected [[W\u00e1lter Guevara]] a temporary president.\n\nSiles finished first in 1980, but came up short of a majority. Days before Congress was due to convene to choose a winner, the army launched the bloody coup of July 17, 1980, which installed a reactionary (and cocaine-tainted) dictatorship of General [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]]. Siles escaped to exile in Peru by crossing [[Lake Titicaca]] on a boat.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref> He returned in 1982, when the military's experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the verge of collapse.\n\n==Second Presidency, 1982-85==\nWith its reputation badly damaged by the excesses of the 1980-82 dictatorship, the military faced two options\u2014call new elections, or accept the 1980 results.  By this time, however, it was obvious that the country would crumble into civil war before new elections could be held. Under the circumstances, the military announced in September 1982 that to spare the expense of new elections and avoid further unrest, it would reconvene the legislature elected in 1980 and accept whomever it chose as president.  Congress reconvened on 23 September and reconfirmed the 1980 election results.  On 5 October, it overwhelmingly elected Siles as president.  He was sworn into his second term on 10 October, with the MIR's [[Jaime Paz Zamora|Jaime Paz]] as his vice-president.\n\nIn 1983, Siles Zuazo reopened relations with [[Bolivia\u2013Cuba relations|Cuba]] after the relationship ended twenty years previous. Cuban doctors began reorganizing the Bolivian health system.\n\nOn June 30, 1984 he was arrested for ten hours during a failed military coup.\n\nThe economic situation was dire, with growing  [[hyperinflation]]. Siles had great difficulty in controlling the situation, and received scant support from the political parties or members of Congress, most of whom were eager to flex their political muscles after so many years of military authoritarianism. The unions, led by their old leader [[Juan Lech\u00edn]], paralyzed the government with constant strikes, and even the vice-president, Jaime Paz, deserted the sinking ship when Siles' popularity sank to an all-time low.\n\nThe 1982-86 hyperinflation would end up being the fourth largest ever recorded in the world. Still, Siles refused to adopt extra-constitutional measures, preferring instead to consolidate the hard-earned Bolivian democracy regardless of the personal cost to him. He even went on a hunger strike as a desperate way to gain public sympathy. Finally, he agreed to shorten his own term and Congress moved the presidential election forward by a year.<ref name=Valenzuela2004>{{cite journal\n | author = Valenzuela, A.\n | year = 2004\n | title = Latin American Presidencies Interrupted\n | journal = Journal of Democracy\n | volume = 15\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 5\u201319\n | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/v015/15.4valenzuela.pdf \n | accessdate = 2007-10-09\n | doi = 10.1353/jod.2004.0075\n}}</ref>\n\nOne bright point in the Siles administration was the 1983 extradition to France of the Nazi war criminal [[Klaus Barbie]], known as the Butcher of Lyon. He had been living in Bolivia since the late 1950s or early 1960s, after being smuggled out of Europe with the assistance of the United States,<ref name=\"whiteout\">{{cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Alexander|author2=Jeffrey St. Clair|title=Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press|url=https://archive.org/details/whiteoutciadrugs00cock|url-access=registration|publisher=Verso|location=New York|year=1998|chapter=Klaus Barbie and the Cocaine Coup|isbn=1-85984-258-5}}</ref> and was often employed by the 1964-82 dictatorships as an interrogation specialist. Following his extradition he was condemned for his crimes and died in a French prison.\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1985 the government's impotence prompted Congress to call early elections, citing the fact that Siles had been originally elected five long years before. His old rival, MNR's [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] was elected president, and Siles left for Uruguay, a country where he had lived before in exile and for which he held special affection. He died in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] in August 1996 at the age of 82.\n\n==See also==\n* [[UMOPAR]]\n* [[Government of Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo, 1982\u201385]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Mesa Jos\u00e9 de; Gisbert, Teresa; and Carlos D.

Siles was raised by his mother. His half-brother [[Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas]] was President for five months in 1969.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref>\n\nIn 1931 Siles graduated from the American Institute in La Paz. He served in Bolivian army and was decorated for injury sustained while fighting in the [[Chaco War]] of 1932-35. After the war he finished San Andres University with a degree in law.\n\nSiles was married to Maria Teresa Ormachea del Carpio and had three daughters, Marcela, Ana Maria and Isabel.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref>\n\n==Formation of the MNR and the 1952 Revolution==\n{{see also|Bolivian National Revolution}}\nIn 1940 Siles was elected in the Chamber of Deputies. Gravitating toward the reformist side of the political spectrum (even though his father had been one of the pillars of the Old Regime), in 1941 he founded along with [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] and others, the influential [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, or MNR).\n\nThe MNR was behind the coup that installed the progressive military administration of [[Gualberto Villarroel]] (1943\u201346), but was forced from power due to U.S. pressure and also by Villarroel's overthrow in 1946 after which Siles was exiled to Argentina. There he worked as a correspondent for [[Associated Press]] from November 1947 until September 1948.\n\nIn the [[1951 Bolivian general election|1951 elections]] Paz Estenssoro run for presidency with Siles as his vice-presidential running mate, and won the contest with 42.9% of the vote. However, the ultra-conservative government of [[Mamerto Urriolagoit\u00eda]] refused to recognize the results and instead turned over the presidency to the commander of the Bolivian army, general [[Hugo Ballivi\u00e1n]]. At that point the MNR party went underground and in April 9\u201311, 1952 led the historic [[Bolivian National Revolution]], aided by defections from the armed forces to the rebel cause (key among which was general Antonio Seleme). Siles played a major role in the revolutionary uprising, along with [[Juan Lech\u00edn]], since the MNR leader Paz Estenssoro was at the time in exile in Argentina.\n\n==Vice-President, 1952-56==\nHaving defeated the military and toppled the Ballivi\u00e1n government, Siles served as provisional president from 11 April 1952 until 16 April 1952, when Estenssoro returned from exile. The 1951 electoral results were upheld, and Paz Estenssoro became constitutional president of Bolivia with Siles as his vice-president.<ref>[http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.bo/Vicepresidencia/GaleriaVicepresidencial/19131956/tabid/81/Default.aspx Vicepresidency of Bolivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030956/http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.bo/Vicepresidencia/GaleriaVicepresidencial/19131956/tabid/81/Default.aspx |date=16 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the MNR's first 4 years in the office, the government instituted far-reaching reforms, including the establishment of the universal vote, nationalization of the largest mining concerns in the country, and the adoption of a major agrarian reform. In 1956 Estenssoro left the office, as the Bolivian Constitution forbade a sitting president from running for another consecutive term. Siles, his logical successor, easily won the [[1956 Bolivian general election|elections of 1956]] and became President of the Republic on August 6, 1956.\n\n==First Presidency 1956-60==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo, Presidente da Bol\u00edvia..tif|thumb|Hern\u00e1n Zuazo, 1956. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nThe first Siles' administration was more contentious and difficult than revolutionary Estenssoro's had been. During this time MNR began to fragment along personal lines and due to growing disagreements over policy.\n\nEconomy was in deep trouble, as food and minerals production had plummeted, inflation soared, and the United States conditioned any aid and further support on the adoption of an economic program of its own prescription (the so-called ''[[Eder plan]]'') in late 1956 under which Siles accepted USA aid in return for cutting government expenses and social programs.\n\nSiles also had to tackle the difficult issue of disarming the worker and miner militia members who had fought in the 1952 Revolution and who had been allowed to keep their weapons. They had served as a useful counterbalance to the possibility of a conservative or military coup against the Revolution, but were by now serving the growing ambitions of the head of the [[Bolivian Workers' Center]] (COB) [[Juan Lech\u00edn]]. Meanwhile, the [[Falange Socialista Boliviana]] party schemed to topple the MNR from power, causing a rather disproportionate repressive backlash that diminished MNR's (and Siles') popularity.\n\n==Break with the MNR and exile, 1960-78==\nAfter the end of Siles' term in 1960, Estenssoro again ran for president in [[1960 Bolivian general election|1960 elections]] and, upon being elected, sent Siles as ambassador to Uruguay until 1963 and as ambassador to Spain (1963\u201364). In 1964 Siles broke with Estrassoro over the latter's decision to run for another consecutive term.\n\nSiles initially supported the [[1964 Bolivian coup d'\u00e9tat|November 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat]] by vice-president, General [[Ren\u00e9 Barrientos]] and army chief [[Alfredo Ovando]] \u2014 but was later exiled when it became apparent that the military intended to manipulate 1966 electoral results to perpetuate itself in power. Except for a five-month interlude during which his half-brother held the presidency, the armed forces remained in control of the Presidential [[Palacio Quemado]] until 1982.\n\nIn 1971 Siles opposed the right-wing coup of general [[Hugo Banzer]], prompting an irreversible break with Estenssoro, who supported the coup. In 1971 Siles formed the [[Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario de Izquierda'', MNRI), beginning a steady leftwards drift.\n\n==The 1978-82 democratic false starts==\nAfter the 1978 democratic opening, Siles returned to Bolivia and formed a grand alliance of the left with the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria, the Communist Party, and others. Together, they formed the [[Unidad Democr\u00e1tica y Popular]] (UDP), which triumphed in the [[1978 Bolivian general election|1978]], [[1979 Bolivian general election|1979]], and [[1980 Bolivian general election|1980]] general elections, mostly as a result of a serious erosion of support for Estenssoro.\n\nThe 1978 election was annulled due to massive fraud in favor of the official military candidate, General [[Juan Pereda]], though exit polls showed Siles would have won handily had the election been conducted honestly. The 1979 contest remained inconclusive because no candidate received 50% of the vote, and Congress elected [[W\u00e1lter Guevara]] a temporary president.\n\nSiles finished first in 1980, but came up short of a majority. Days before Congress was due to convene to choose a winner, the army launched the bloody coup of July 17, 1980, which installed a reactionary (and cocaine-tainted) dictatorship of General [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]]. Siles escaped to exile in Peru by crossing [[Lake Titicaca]] on a boat.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/world/hernan-siles-zuazo-ex-president-of-bolivia-is-dead-at-83.html Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83]</ref> He returned in 1982, when the military's experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the verge of collapse.\n\n==Second Presidency, 1982-85==\nWith its reputation badly damaged by the excesses of the 1980-82 dictatorship, the military faced two options\u2014call new elections, or accept the 1980 results.  By this time, however, it was obvious that the country would crumble into civil war before new elections could be held. Under the circumstances, the military announced in September 1982 that to spare the expense of new elections and avoid further unrest, it would reconvene the legislature elected in 1980 and accept whomever it chose as president.  Congress reconvened on 23 September and reconfirmed the 1980 election results.  On 5 October, it overwhelmingly elected Siles as president.  He was sworn into his second term on 10 October, with the MIR's [[Jaime Paz Zamora|Jaime Paz]] as his vice-president.\n\nIn 1983, Zuazo reopened relations with [[Bolivia\u2013Cuba relations|Cuba]] after the relationship ended twenty years previous. Cuban doctors began reorganizing the Bolivian health system.\n\nOn June 30, 1984 he was arrested for ten hours during a failed military coup.\n\nThe economic situation was dire, with growing  [[hyperinflation]]. Siles had great difficulty in controlling the situation, and received scant support from the political parties or members of Congress, most of whom were eager to flex their political muscles after so many years of military authoritarianism. The unions, led by their old leader [[Juan Lech\u00edn]], paralyzed the government with constant strikes, and even the vice-president, Jaime Paz, deserted the sinking ship when Siles' popularity sank to an all-time low.\n\nThe 1982-86 hyperinflation would end up being the fourth largest ever recorded in the world. Still, Siles refused to adopt extra-constitutional measures, preferring instead to consolidate the hard-earned Bolivian democracy regardless of the personal cost to him. He even went on a hunger strike as a desperate way to gain public sympathy. Finally, he agreed to shorten his own term and Congress moved the presidential election forward by a year.<ref name=Valenzuela2004>{{cite journal\n | author = Valenzuela, A.\n | year = 2004\n | title = Latin American Presidencies Interrupted\n | journal = Journal of Democracy\n | volume = 15\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 5\u201319\n | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/v015/15.4valenzuela.pdf \n | accessdate = 2007-10-09\n | doi = 10.1353/jod.2004.0075\n}}</ref>\n\nOne bright point in the Siles administration was the 1983 extradition to France of the Nazi war criminal [[Klaus Barbie]], known as the Butcher of Lyon. He had been living in Bolivia since the late 1950s or early 1960s, after being smuggled out of Europe with the assistance of the United States,<ref name=\"whiteout\">{{cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Alexander|author2=Jeffrey St. Clair|title=Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press|url=https://archive.org/details/whiteoutciadrugs00cock|url-access=registration|publisher=Verso|location=New York|year=1998|chapter=Klaus Barbie and the Cocaine Coup|isbn=1-85984-258-5}}</ref> and was often employed by the 1964-82 dictatorships as an interrogation specialist. Following his extradition he was condemned for his crimes and died in a French prison.\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1985 the government's impotence prompted Congress to call early elections, citing the fact that Siles had been originally elected five long years before. His old rival, MNR's [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] was elected president, and Siles left for Uruguay, a country where he had lived before in exile and for which he held special affection. He died in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] in August 1996 at the age of 82.\n\n==See also==\n* [[UMOPAR]]\n* [[Government of Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo, 1982\u201385]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Mesa Jos\u00e9 de; Gisbert, Teresa; and Carlos D.

MacNair and Frances also married the previous year. The group worked collaboratively and came to be known as \"The Four\", and were prominent figures in [[Glasgow Style]] art and design.\n\nIn 1904, after he had completed several successful building designs, Mackintosh became a partner in Honeyman & Keppie, and the company became Honeyman, Keppie & Mackintosh. When economic hardships were causing many architectural practices to close, in 1913, he resigned from the partnership and attempted to open his own practice.\n\n==Design influences==\n[[File:Room de Luxe.jpg|thumb|right|The Room de Luxe at The Willow Tearooms features furniture and interior design by Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald.]]\n\nMackintosh lived most of his life in the city of Glasgow, located on the banks of the [[River Clyde]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the city had one of the greatest production centres of heavy engineering and shipbuilding in the world. As the city grew and prospered, a faster response to the high demand for consumer goods and arts was necessary. Industrialized, mass-produced items started to gain popularity. Along with the Industrial Revolution, Asian style and emerging [[modernist]] ideas also influenced Mackintosh's [[designs]]. When the Japanese isolationist regime softened, they opened themselves to globalisation resulting in notable Japanese influence around the world. Glasgow's link with the eastern country became particularly close with shipyards at the River Clyde being exposed to Japanese navy and training engineers. Japanese design became more accessible and gained great popularity. In fact, it became so popular and so incessantly appropriated and reproduced by Western artists, that the Western world's fascination and preoccupation with Japanese art gave rise to the new term, ''[[Japonism]]'' or ''Japonisme''.\n\nThis style was admired by Mackintosh because of its restraint and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; and its use of texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner; the value of the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused on the quality of the space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic feeling to the interior.\n\n[[File:Wfm scotland street.jpg|thumb|left|Scotland Street school in Glasgow.]]\nAt the same time a new philosophy concerned with creating functional and practical design was emerging throughout Europe: the so-called \"modernist ideas\". The main concept of the Modernist movement was to develop innovative ideas and new technology: design was concerned with the present and the future, rather than with history and tradition. Heavy ornamentation and inherited styles were discarded. Even though Mackintosh became known as the \u2018pioneer\u2019 of the movement, his designs were far removed from the bleak utilitarianism of Modernism. His concern was to build around the needs of people: people seen, not as masses, but as individuals who needed not a machine for living in but a work of art.  Mackintosh took his inspiration from his Scottish upbringing and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms.\n\nWhile working in architecture, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves (for example, the Mackintosh Rose motif), along with some references to traditional Scottish architecture. The project that helped make his international reputation was the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897\u20131909). During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh also completed the [[Queen's Cross Church, Glasgow|Queen's Cross Church project]] in Maryhill, Glasgow. This is considered to be one of Mackintosh's most mysterious projects. It is the only church by the Glasgow-born artist to be built and is now the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society headquarters.\nLike his contemporary [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Mackintosh's architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. The majority, if not all, of this detailing and significant contributions to his architectural drawings were designed and detailed by his wife Margaret Macdonald<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/margaret-macdonald.html |title=Margaret macdonald &#124; Features &#124; The Official Gateway to Scotland |publisher=Scotland.org |accessdate=27 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181326/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/margaret-macdonald.html |archivedate=16 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> whom Charles had met when they both attended the Glasgow School of Art.

Popular in Austria and Germany, his work received acclaim when it was shown at the [[Vienna Secession]] Exhibition in 1900. It was also exhibited in Budapest, Munich, Dresden, Venice and Moscow.\n\n==Design work and paintings==\n[[File:Charles Rennie Mackintosh Cabinet (8030216621).jpg|thumb|Charles Rennie Mackintosh Cabinet, [[Royal Ontario Museum]].]]\n\nMackintosh, his future wife [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh|Margaret MacDonald]], her sister [[Frances MacDonald]], and [[Herbert MacNair]] met at evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art (see above). They became known as a collaborative group, \"The Four\", or \"The Glasgow Four\", and were prominent members of the \"[[Glasgow School]]\" movement.<ref name=UndiscoveredScotland>{{cite web|title=Margaret Macdonald|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/mac/margaretmacdonald.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland: The Ultimate Online Guide}}</ref>  The group exhibited in Glasgow, London and Vienna, and these exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called \"Glasgow\" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as ''Sezessionstil'' (in English, the [[Vienna Secession]]) around 1900.  Mackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work.\n\n==Later life==\n\nLater in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a watercolourist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh's own gradually converged).  They moved to the [[Suffolk]] village of [[Walberswick]] in 1914. There Mackintosh was suspected of being a German spy and briefly arrested in 1915 during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/rennie-mackintosh-locked-up-as-german-spy-1-537041|title=Rennie Mackintosh locked up as 'German spy'|author=Gordan Tait|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=29 June 2004|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1923, the Mackintoshes had moved to [[Port Vendres]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.port-vendres.com/uk/page_ic.php?CatID=126&ArtID=160&them=3000 |title=Port-Vendres, official site of the city and the tourist office \u2013 Official website |publisher=Port-vendres.com |accessdate=27 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715104834/http://www.port-vendres.com/uk/page_ic.php?CatID=126&ArtID=160&them=3000 |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a Mediterranean coastal town in southern [[France]] with a warm climate that was a comparably cheaper location in which to live. Mackintosh had entirely abandoned architecture and design and concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes and created a large portfolio of architecture and landscape watercolour paintings.  Many of his paintings depict Port Vendres, a small port near the Spanish border, and the landscapes of [[Roussillon]]. The local Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail details his time in Port Vendres and shows the paintings and their locations.<ref>[http://www.crmackintoshfrance.com/crm-mackintosh-trail.html The Mackintosh Trail], ''L'association Charles Rennie Mackintosh en Roussillon''</ref>  The couple remained in France for two years, before being forced to return to London in 1927 due to illness.\n\nThat year, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was diagnosed with [[tongue cancer]] and [[throat cancer]].  This is clearly described in the letters he was writing to his wife from France. A brief recovery prompted him to leave the hospital and convalesce at home for a few months.  Mackintosh was admitted to a nursing home where he died on 10 December 1928 at the age of 60. He was cremated the next day at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in London. His ashes were scattered, in accordance with his wishes, over the Mediterranean at Port Vendres from one of the rocks he had painted.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkkwNvKMVs4 \"Video 3/3 :Charles Rennie Mackintosh - A Modern Man\" (1996) ]</ref><ref>[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xwhs1 BBC Scotland Documentary, 2018 ''Mackintosh: Glasgow\u2019s Neglected Genius'']</ref>\n\n==Retrospect==\n[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|The front (north) CM Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art on Renfrew Street, Garnethill in Glasgow, Scotland.]]\nMackintosh's designs gained in popularity in the decades following his death. His [[House for an Art Lover]] was built in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in 1996, and the [[University of Glasgow]] (which owns most of his watercolour work) rebuilt the interior of a terraced house Mackintosh had designed, and furnished it with his and Margaret's work (it is part of the university's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]]).\n\nThe [[Glasgow School of Art]] building (now \"The Mackintosh Building\") is cited by architectural critics as among the finest buildings in the UK. On 23 May 2014 the building was ravaged by fire. The library was destroyed, but firefighters managed to save the rest of the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/24/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-uk-government-help-pay-repairs|title=Library destroyed at Glasgow School of Art|work=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 June 2018, about a year before completion of the restoration of the building the School was again struck by fire. This second fire caused catastrophic damage, effectively destroying all the interiors and leaving the outer walls so structurally unstable that large sections of them had to be taken down to prevent uncontrolled collapse. Such was the global concern that a public commitment to faithfully rebuild The Mackintosh Building was made post-fire by then Director of The Glasgow School of Art, Tom Inns.\n\nThe Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society encourages greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an architect, artist and designer. The rediscovery of Mackintosh as a significant figure in design has been attributed to the designation of Glasgow as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSFB|title=The Glasgow Story: Modern Times|publisher=City of Glasgow Culture and Leisure Services|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref> and exhibition of his work which accompanied the year-long festival. His enduring popularity since has been fuelled by further exhibitions and books and memorabilia which have illustrated aspects of his life and work. The revival of public interest has led to the refurbishment and opening of more buildings to the public, such as the Willow Tea Rooms in Glasgow and [[78 Derngate]] in Northampton.  From the 1990s onwards the Scottish artist Stewart Bowman Johnson, who studied in the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art, produced a series of interpretations of the architect's work including works depicting the doors and windows of the Willow tearooms.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City held a major retrospective exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's works from 21 November 1996 to 16 February 1997. In conjunction with the exhibit were lectures and a symposium by scholars, including Pamela Robertson of the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow art gallery owner Roger Billcliffe, and architect J. Stewart Johnson, and screening of documentary films about Mackintosh.<ref>''Charles Rennie Mackintosh: Gallery Plan and Program Guide'' (1996).

designer, water colourist and artist. His artistic approach had much in common with European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. His work, alongside that of his wife [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh|Margaret Macdonald]], was influential on European design movements such as [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Secession (art)|Secessionism]] and praised by great modernists such as [[Josef Hoffmann]]. Mackintosh was born in [[Glasgow]] and died in [[London]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:The Willow Tearooms.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[The Willow Tearooms]] in [[Sauchiehall Street]], Glasgow]]\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh was born at 70 Parson Street, [[Townhead]], Glasgow, on 7 June 1868, the fourth of eleven children and second son of William McIntosh, a superintendent and chief clerk of the [[City of Glasgow Police]], and his wife, Margaret Rennie.

He was engaged to marry his employer's sister, Jessie Keppie.<ref name=BBCScotland>{{cite news|last1=Panther|first1=Patricia|title=Margaret MacDonald: the talented other half of Charles Rennie Mackintosh|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/margaret_macdonald_the_talented_other_half_of_charles_rennie_mackintosh.shtml|accessdate=4 December 2014|work=BBC Scotland|date=10 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nAround 1892, Mackintosh met fellow artist [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh|Margaret Macdonald]] at the Glasgow School of Art.

MacNair and Frances also married the previous year. The group worked collaboratively and came to be known as \"The Four\", and were prominent figures in [[Glasgow Style]] art and design.\n\nIn 1904, after he had completed several successful building designs, Mackintosh became a partner in Honeyman & Keppie, and the company became Honeyman, Keppie & Mackintosh. When economic hardships were causing many architectural practices to close, in 1913, he resigned from the partnership and attempted to open his own practice.\n\n==Design influences==\n[[File:Room de Luxe.jpg|thumb|right|The Room de Luxe at The Willow Tearooms features furniture and interior design by Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald.]]\n\nMackintosh lived most of his life in the city of Glasgow, located on the banks of the [[River Clyde]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the city had one of the greatest production centres of heavy engineering and shipbuilding in the world. As the city grew and prospered, a faster response to the high demand for consumer goods and arts was necessary. Industrialized, mass-produced items started to gain popularity. Along with the Industrial Revolution, Asian style and emerging [[modernist]] ideas also influenced Mackintosh's [[designs]]. When the Japanese isolationist regime softened, they opened themselves to globalisation resulting in notable Japanese influence around the world. Glasgow's link with the eastern country became particularly close with shipyards at the River Clyde being exposed to Japanese navy and training engineers. Japanese design became more accessible and gained great popularity. In fact, it became so popular and so incessantly appropriated and reproduced by Western artists, that the Western world's fascination and preoccupation with Japanese art gave rise to the new term, ''[[Japonism]]'' or ''Japonisme''.\n\nThis style was admired by Mackintosh because of its restraint and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; and its use of texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner; the value of the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused on the quality of the space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic feeling to the interior.\n\n[[File:Wfm scotland street.jpg|thumb|left|Scotland Street school in Glasgow.]]\nAt the same time a new philosophy concerned with creating functional and practical design was emerging throughout Europe: the so-called \"modernist ideas\". The main concept of the Modernist movement was to develop innovative ideas and new technology: design was concerned with the present and the future, rather than with history and tradition. Heavy ornamentation and inherited styles were discarded. Even though Mackintosh became known as the \u2018pioneer\u2019 of the movement, his designs were far removed from the bleak utilitarianism of Modernism. His concern was to build around the needs of people: people seen, not as masses, but as individuals who needed not a machine for living in but a work of art.  Mackintosh took his inspiration from his Scottish upbringing and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms.\n\nWhile working in architecture, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves (for example, the Mackintosh Rose motif), along with some references to traditional Scottish architecture. The project that helped make his international reputation was the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897\u20131909). During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh also completed the [[Queen's Cross Church, Glasgow|Queen's Cross Church project]] in Maryhill, Glasgow. This is considered to be one of Mackintosh's most mysterious projects. It is the only church by the Glasgow-born artist to be built and is now the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society headquarters.\nLike his contemporary [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Mackintosh's architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. The majority, if not all, of this detailing and significant contributions to his architectural drawings were designed and detailed by his wife Margaret Macdonald<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/margaret-macdonald.html |title=Margaret macdonald &#124; Features &#124; The Official Gateway to Scotland |publisher=Scotland.org |accessdate=27 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181326/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/margaret-macdonald.html |archivedate=16 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> whom Charles had met when they both attended the Glasgow School of Art.

They became known as a collaborative group, \"The Four\", or \"The Glasgow Four\", and were prominent members of the \"[[Glasgow School]]\" movement.<ref name=UndiscoveredScotland>{{cite web|title=Margaret Macdonald|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/mac/margaretmacdonald.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland: The Ultimate Online Guide}}</ref>  The group exhibited in Glasgow, London and Vienna, and these exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called \"Glasgow\" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as ''Sezessionstil'' (in English, the [[Vienna Secession]]) around 1900.  Mackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work.\n\n==Later life==\n\nLater in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a watercolourist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh's own gradually converged).  They moved to the [[Suffolk]] village of [[Walberswick]] in 1914. There Mackintosh was suspected of being a German spy and briefly arrested in 1915 during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/rennie-mackintosh-locked-up-as-german-spy-1-537041|title=Rennie Mackintosh locked up as 'German spy'|author=Gordan Tait|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=29 June 2004|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1923, the Mackintoshes had moved to [[Port Vendres]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.port-vendres.com/uk/page_ic.php?CatID=126&ArtID=160&them=3000 |title=Port-Vendres, official site of the city and the tourist office \u2013 Official website |publisher=Port-vendres.com |accessdate=27 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715104834/http://www.port-vendres.com/uk/page_ic.php?CatID=126&ArtID=160&them=3000 |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a Mediterranean coastal town in southern [[France]] with a warm climate that was a comparably cheaper location in which to live. Mackintosh had entirely abandoned architecture and design and concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes and created a large portfolio of architecture and landscape watercolour paintings.  Many of his paintings depict Port Vendres, a small port near the Spanish border, and the landscapes of [[Roussillon]]. The local Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail details his time in Port Vendres and shows the paintings and their locations.<ref>[http://www.crmackintoshfrance.com/crm-mackintosh-trail.html The Mackintosh Trail], ''L'association Charles Rennie Mackintosh en Roussillon''</ref>  The couple remained in France for two years, before being forced to return to London in 1927 due to illness.\n\nThat year, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was diagnosed with [[tongue cancer]] and [[throat cancer]].  This is clearly described in the letters he was writing to his wife from France. A brief recovery prompted him to leave the hospital and convalesce at home for a few months.  Mackintosh was admitted to a nursing home where he died on 10 December 1928 at the age of 60. He was cremated the next day at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in London. His ashes were scattered, in accordance with his wishes, over the Mediterranean at Port Vendres from one of the rocks he had painted.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkkwNvKMVs4 \"Video 3/3 :Charles Rennie Mackintosh - A Modern Man\" (1996) ]</ref><ref>[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xwhs1 BBC Scotland Documentary, 2018 ''Mackintosh: Glasgow\u2019s Neglected Genius'']</ref>\n\n==Retrospect==\n[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|The front (north) CM Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art on Renfrew Street, Garnethill in Glasgow, Scotland.]]\nMackintosh's designs gained in popularity in the decades following his death. His [[House for an Art Lover]] was built in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in 1996, and the [[University of Glasgow]] (which owns most of his watercolour work) rebuilt the interior of a terraced house Mackintosh had designed, and furnished it with his and Margaret's work (it is part of the university's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]]).\n\nThe [[Glasgow School of Art]] building (now \"The Mackintosh Building\") is cited by architectural critics as among the finest buildings in the UK. On 23 May 2014 the building was ravaged by fire. The library was destroyed, but firefighters managed to save the rest of the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/24/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-uk-government-help-pay-repairs|title=Library destroyed at Glasgow School of Art|work=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 June 2018, about a year before completion of the restoration of the building the School was again struck by fire. This second fire caused catastrophic damage, effectively destroying all the interiors and leaving the outer walls so structurally unstable that large sections of them had to be taken down to prevent uncontrolled collapse. Such was the global concern that a public commitment to faithfully rebuild The Mackintosh Building was made post-fire by then Director of The Glasgow School of Art, Tom Inns.\n\nThe Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society encourages greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an architect, artist and designer. The rediscovery of Mackintosh as a significant figure in design has been attributed to the designation of Glasgow as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSFB|title=The Glasgow Story: Modern Times|publisher=City of Glasgow Culture and Leisure Services|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref> and exhibition of his work which accompanied the year-long festival. His enduring popularity since has been fuelled by further exhibitions and books and memorabilia which have illustrated aspects of his life and work. The revival of public interest has led to the refurbishment and opening of more buildings to the public, such as the Willow Tea Rooms in Glasgow and [[78 Derngate]] in Northampton.  From the 1990s onwards the Scottish artist Stewart Bowman Johnson, who studied in the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art, produced a series of interpretations of the architect's work including works depicting the doors and windows of the Willow tearooms.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City held a major retrospective exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's works from 21 November 1996 to 16 February 1997. In conjunction with the exhibit were lectures and a symposium by scholars, including Pamela Robertson of the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow art gallery owner Roger Billcliffe, and architect J. Stewart Johnson, and screening of documentary films about Mackintosh.<ref>''Charles Rennie Mackintosh: Gallery Plan and Program Guide'' (1996).

On 4 January 2005, aged 24 he moved to [[Premier League]] side [[Blackburn Rovers]] in which he described his move as a dream.\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nMokoena made his debut for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] on 8 January 2005 in an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], coming on as a 43rd-minute substitute for [[Barry Ferguson]]. After this, [[Mark Hughes]] mainly utilised Mokoena as a holding midfielder. Mokoena went on to be a regular in the starting line-up for the remainder of the season, appearing 22 times in total. He was used by Hughes as the holding midfielder in a three-man midfield in a defensive 4\u20135\u20131 formation, a move which saw Blackburn concede fewer goals and move away from relegation danger.\n\nHughes later reverted to a 4\u20134\u20132 formation. From then on, Mokoena found himself used sparingly as a holding midfielder in his favoured 4\u20135\u20131 formation as a second-half substitute, charged with protecting leads in games in which Blackburn were winning. With [[Robbie Savage]] out injured for Rovers, Mokoena started most of the team's games in 2007 and he scored his first goal for Blackburn in an [[FA Cup]] 6th round victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 11 March 2007.

On 31 May 2010, he was named in South Africa's 23-man World Cup squad.\n\nHe won his 100th cap against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] in [[Polokwane]] in a 5\u20130 win on 3 May 2010, and celebrated by taking to the field wearing the number 100 on the back of his shirt. On 11 June 2010, he captained [[Bafana Bafana]] in the opening group game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] of the 2010 World Cup and also played the full 90 minutes alongside [[Bongani Khumalo]] in a 1\u20131 draw in [[Johannesburg]].

Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]] and then transferring to [[K.R.C. Genk|KRC Genk]] for two years. On 4 January 2005, aged 24 he moved to [[Premier League]] side [[Blackburn Rovers]] in which he described his move as a dream.\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nMokoena made his debut for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] on 8 January 2005 in an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], coming on as a 43rd-minute substitute for [[Barry Ferguson]]. After this, [[Mark Hughes]] mainly utilised Mokoena as a holding midfielder. Mokoena went on to be a regular in the starting line-up for the remainder of the season, appearing 22 times in total. He was used by Hughes as the holding midfielder in a three-man midfield in a defensive 4\u20135\u20131 formation, a move which saw Blackburn concede fewer goals and move away from relegation danger. Hughes later reverted to a 4\u20134\u20132 formation. From then on, Mokoena found himself used sparingly as a holding midfielder in his favoured 4\u20135\u20131 formation as a second-half substitute, charged with protecting leads in games in which Blackburn were winning. With [[Robbie Savage]] out injured for Rovers, Mokoena started most of the team's games in 2007 and he scored his first goal for Blackburn in an [[FA Cup]] 6th round victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 11 March 2007. However, he was later sent off after getting a second yellow card.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6415101.stm\n|title=Blackburn 2\u20130 Man City \n|publisher=[[BBC]] \n|date=11 March 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref> He scored his second and final Blackburn goal against [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] in February 2009, again this time in the FA Cup replay in Rovers' 2\u20131 win at [[Ewood Park]] which was also voted as goal of the season for the 2008\u201309 season.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7858913.stm\n|title=Blackburn 2\u20131 Sunderland (aet) \n|publisher=[[BBC]] \n|date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009}}</ref> Mokoena played his final game for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 24 May 2009 against [[West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Ewood Park]] in the 0\u20130 draw.\n\n===Portsmouth===\nOn 24 May 2009 he announced he would be joining fellow [[Premier League]] outfit [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a three-year deal.<ref name=\"Pompey chimes for Mokoena\">{{cite news|title=Pompey chimes for Mokoena |url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1666197,00.html |work=www.Rovers.co.uk |publisher=Blackburn Rovers F.C. |date=24 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527081405/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10303~1666197%2C00.html |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> He scored his first goal for Portsmouth in the last minute of extra time to give them victory over [[Coventry City]] at the [[Ricoh Arena]] in the dying seconds in the [[FA Cup]] 3rd round replay on 12 January 2010.
