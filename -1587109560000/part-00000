At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332\u201333 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1\u20134 million people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding.

These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]]. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].<ref>[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission]. Yellowriver.gov.cn. Retrieved on 2013-02-04.</ref>\n\n===Upper reaches===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Yellow river - A. Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]\n[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]\n\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&nbsp;billion and 10.8&nbsp;billion m\u00b3 (166 and 381 billion ft<sup>3</sup>), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Mekong]].\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoig\u00ea Marsh|Zoig\u00ea Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoig\u00ea County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n===Middle reaches===\n{{main|Ordos Loop}}\n[[File:Landzhou 07-2005.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Shapotou.jpg|thumb|At [[Shapotou]], [[Ningxia]]]]\n[[File:Qiankun Bend.jpg|thumb|Qiankun bend in [[Yonghe County]]]]\n[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]\nThe [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 (57.4&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].\n\n===Lower reaches===\nIn the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km\u00b2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}</ref> The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At [[Kaifeng]], Henan, the Yellow River is {{convert|10|m|sp=us|0}} above the ground level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214151633/http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |author=Leung, George |title=Reclamation and Sediment Control in the Middle Yellow River Valley |journal=Water International |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=12\u201319 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/02508069608686482}}</ref>\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:5922-Daxia-River-fall-into-Liujiaxia-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|The mouth of the [[Daxia River]] (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's [[Liujiaxia Reservoir]] in [[Linxia Prefecture]], [[Gansu]]]]\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n*[[White River (China)|White River]] \n*[[Ejin River|Black River]] \n*[[Huangshui River|Huang Shui]] \n**[[Datong River]] \n*[[Daxia River]] \n*[[Tao River]] \n*[[Zuli River]] \n*[[Qingshuihe River|Qingshui River]]\n*[[Dahei River]] \n*[[Kuye River]] \n*[[Wuding River]] \n*[[Fen River]] \n*[[Wei River]] (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n*[[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] \n*[[Qin River]] \n*[[Dawen River]] \n*[[Kuo River]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:Yellow River Delta Animation.gif|thumb|Expansion of the Yellow River Delta from 1989 to 2009 in five year intervals.]]\n\nThe Yellow River is notable for the large amount of [[silt]] it carries\u20141.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the [[Loess Plateau]]. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Treg\"/>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (48,572&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\">[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1]. ''The New York Times'' (2007-05-30)</ref> The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090&nbsp;mi\u00b2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.<ref>[http://china.org.cn/english/2005/Feb/119497.htm Yellow River Delta Shrinking 7.6 Square Kilometers Annually], ''China Daily'' 1 February 2005</ref>\n\nThe highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Hydroelectric power dams==\n[[File:6058-Liujiaxia-Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia Dam]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Smxgongcheng zengmian.jpg|thumb|[[Sanmenxia Dam]], [[Henan]]]]\nBelow is the list of [[hydroelectric]] power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n*[[Sanmenxia Dam]]  (1960; [[Sanmenxia]], Henan)\n*[[Sanshenggong Dam]] (1966)\n*[[Qingtong Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1968; [[Qingtongxia]], Ningxia)\n*[[Liujiaxia Dam]] (Liujia Gorge) (1974; [[Yongjing County]], Gansu)\n*[[Lijiaxia Dam]] (1997) ([[Jainca County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yanguoxia Dam]] (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n*[[Tianqiao Dam]] (1977)\n*[[Bapanxia Dam]] (Bapan Gorge) (1980; [[Xigu District]], [[Lanzhou]], Gansu)\n*[[Longyangxia Dam]]  (1992; [[Gonghe County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Da Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1998)\n*[[Li Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1999)\n*[[Wanjiazhai Dam]] (1999; [[Pianguan County]], Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia)\n*[[Xiaolangdi Dam]] (2001) ([[Jiyuan]], Henan)\n*[[Laxiwa Dam]] (2010) ([[Guide County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yangqu Dam]] (2016) ([[Xinghai County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Maerdang Dam]] (2018) ([[Maq\u00ean County]], Qinghai)\n\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/14/eng20001214_57817.html Yellow River Upstream Important to West-East Power Transmission]  People's Daily, 14 December 2000</ref>\n\n==Crossings==\n[[File:Major cities along the Yellow River.svg|right|thumb|450px|Major cities along the Yellow River]]\n[[File:Yellow river pontoon bridge jinan 2008 05.jpg|thumb|[[Pontoon bridge]] (Luokou Pontoon Bridge {{zh\n|s={{linktext|\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6865}}\n|t=\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6a4b\n|p=Lu\u00f2k\u014fu F\u00faqi\u00e1o}}) over the Yellow River in [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]]]]\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Shandong]]\n* [[Dongying Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Shengli Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Dongying]])\n* [[Lijin Yellow River Bridge]] (Dongying)\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou\u2013Laiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Binzhou]]\u2013[[Zibo]])\n* [[Huiqing Yellow River Bridge]] (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* [[Jiyang Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jinan]])\n* [[G20 Qingdao\u2013Yinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013[[Dezhou]])\n* [[Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Pingyin Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan-[[Liaocheng]])\n\nShandong\u2013[[Henan]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jining]]\u2013[[Puyang]])\n* [[Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge]] ([[Heze]]\u2013Puyang)\n* [[Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge]] (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n\nHenan\n* [[Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Kaifeng]])\n* [[Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Zhengzhou]])\n\n[[Shanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Sanmen Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Sanmenxia]])\n\n[[Shaanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge]]\n\n[[Ningxia]]\n* [[Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Yinchuan]])\n\n[[Inner Mongolia]]\n* [[Baotou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Baotou]])\n\n[[Gansu]]\n* [[Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Zhongshan Bridge]] ([[Lanzhou]])\n\n[[Qinghai]]\n* [[Dari Yellow River Bridge]]\n<!--* Zalinghu crossing-->\n\n==Fauna==\n===Fish===\n[[File:DV Paradise fish male 03.jpg|thumb|The [[paradise fish]] is well-known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River]]\n\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 [[genera]] and 28 [[Family (biology)|families]], including 19 species found nowhere else in the world ([[Endemism|endemic]]).<ref name=Xie2018>{{cite journal | author1=Xie, J.Y. | author2=W.J.

The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water.

Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding.

The source tributaries drain into [[Gyaring Lake]] and [[Ngoring Lake]] on the western edge of [[Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golog Prefecture]] high in the Bayan Har Mountains of [[Qinghai]]. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with [[Gansu]], the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"[[Ordos Loop]]\", and then flows generally eastward across the [[North China Plain]] to the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], draining a [[drainage basin|basin]] of {{convert|752443|km\u00b2|sp=us|0}} which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day [[Province (China)|provinces]] and two [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], namely (from west to east) [[Qinghai]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Inner Mongolia, [[Shaanxi]], Shanxi, [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) [[Lanzhou]], [[Yinchuan]], [[Wuhai]], [[Baotou]], [[Luoyang]], [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Jinan]]. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at [[Kenli County]], Shandong.\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]]. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].<ref>[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission].

Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]\n[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]\n\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&nbsp;billion and 10.8&nbsp;billion m\u00b3 (166 and 381 billion ft<sup>3</sup>), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Mekong]].\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoig\u00ea Marsh|Zoig\u00ea Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoig\u00ea County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n===Middle reaches===\n{{main|Ordos Loop}}\n[[File:Landzhou 07-2005.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Shapotou.jpg|thumb|At [[Shapotou]], [[Ningxia]]]]\n[[File:Qiankun Bend.jpg|thumb|Qiankun bend in [[Yonghe County]]]]\n[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]\nThe [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 (57.4&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].\n\n===Lower reaches===\nIn the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km\u00b2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}</ref> The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground.

If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Treg\"/>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (48,572&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\">[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1].

Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years.

In 1951, she was converted to diesel-electric power, completely rebuilt and renamed ''North Head''. She was removed from service in 1985 following the introduction of the [[Freshwater-class ferry|Freshwater class ferries]]. She spent time in Hobart as a floating restaurant, and in 2000, she was taken to [[Cairns]] where she remains grounded and in deteriorating condition.\n\nThe name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. \"North Head\" is [[North Head, New South Wales|the northern headland]] at the entrance to [[Sydney Harbour]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kuringgai Flickr.jpg|thumb|left|''Kuring-gai'' (1901) was the forerunner to the \"Bingarra-type\" vessels including ''Barrenjoey''. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to ''Barrenjoey''{{'}}s at the ends of the sun deck.]]\n\nThe Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in [[Sydney Cove]] - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the properous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing enginee size and power. \n\nThe first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative [[Walter Reeks]]\u2013designed vessels; the ''[[SS Manly]]'' (1896), and ''[[SS Kuring-gai]]'' (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \"Binggarra-class\" ferries. They both had high [[forecastle]]s at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the [[Sydney Heads]]. The steel-hulled ''Kuring-gai'' was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \"Binngarra-class\" vessels.

The first five were built at Mort's [[Woolwich]] yard and ''Baragoola'' was built at the [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. \n\n==Steam ship ''Barrenjoey''==\n[[File:Manly ferry Barrenjoey.jpg|thumb|left|''Barrenjoey'' on Sydney Harbour, 1920s, before expansion of her wheelhouses]]\n\nFollowing ''Bellubera''{{'}}s success (she was bigger and faster than the preceding ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra''), in 1911 the Company placed an order for two new vessels, ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'', which were largely the same design. The three would represent the largest, fastest, and most refined of the six \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. Like the previous four of the class, ''Barrenjoey'' was built by [[Mort's Dock]] at their [[Woolwich, New South Wales|Woolwich]] yard. \n\nThe three vessels all had riveted steel hulls with single screws at either end, and steam steering equipment. ''Barrenjoey'' was 500 tons, 64.0 m in length and had a passenger capacity of 1,512. Her 112 horsepower triple expansion steam engines were also built by Mort's Dock could push her at up to 15 knots. The vessels had \"navy-type\" boilers with corrugated furnaces in both.\n\nThe ships' promenade (upper) decks were entirely open except for two small shelters and the canopy formed by the sun deck. All of the \"Binngarra-class\" would later have their upper decks enclosed except the first two, ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra Bra''. The main (lower) decks were enclosed and had outside perimeter seating. The two decks were connected by two double internal staircases. The ladies' cabin was located at the aft end of the main deck, while the crew spaces were placed on a flat forward of the boiler room. Electric lighting was fitted throughout. \n\n''Barrenjoey'' was launched on 8 May 1913 by the daughter of Mr. B. McBride (a director of the Port Jackson Company). The name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. Her see trials were run on 17 September 1913 from near [[Long Nose Point]] to the Sow and Pigs and back. A newspaper report said that she exceeded the speed stipulated in the contract by one knot. Following the trials, guests of the company were entertained at a luncheon held on board with her moored off [[Cremorne Point]]. The chairman noted that since the paddle steamer ''Narrabeen'' (1886), the combined value of new steamers delivered by Mort's Dock for the company was \u00a3170,000. In 1901, the fleet comprised five steamers with a combined capacity of 4,300 passengers. Twelve years later with ''Barrenjoey''{{'}}s introduction, there were eight vessels with a combined capacity of 10,500. The new steamer was placed in service on 20 September 1913, at which time the company's capacity was sufficient and ''Baragoola'' wasn't delivered until 1922.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY approaches Circular Quay circa 1930.jpg|In her recently enclosed uppper decks, 1931.\n\nThe cost and difficulty of replacing the large steel-hulled Manly ferries saw them upgraded and modified rather than replaced.

However, the company's post-war economic difficulties and the cost of the ''Barrenjoey'''s rebuild and diesel conversion almost bankrupted the company. As such, ''Balgowlah'' was decommissioned and sold to ship breakers in 1953 and the engines acquired for her went to ''Baragoola''. Upgrades to ''Bellubera'' and ''Baragoola'' in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. ''Bellubera'' was withdrawn from service in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in December 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey''/''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \n\u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 a.m. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu''{{'}}s upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head''{{'}}s wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Australian ferry}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD off Bradley's Head 17 January 1972.jpg\n|Ship image size=300px\n|Ship caption={{nowrap|as ''North Head'' on [[Sydney Harbour]], 1972}}}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Australia|civil}}\n|Ship name=*MV ''North Head''\n*formerly SS ''Barrenjoey''\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship operator=*[[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]]\n*[[Public Transport Commission]]\n*[[Urban Transit Authority]]\n|Ship registry=[[Port Jackson|Sydney]]\n|Ship namesake=*[[Sydney Heads|North Head]]\n*[[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|Barrenjoey]]\n|Ship route=[[Manly ferry services|Manly]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Mort's Dock]]\n|Ship original cost=\u00a332,000\n|Ship yard number=39\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=8 May 1913\n|Ship completed=\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship maiden voyage=\n|Ship in service=20 September 1913\n|Ship out of service=12 December 1985\n|Ship identification={{IMO Number|5256939}}\n|Ship fate=\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tonnage=499 tonnes\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length=\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship decks=2\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship ramps=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship capacity=1,262\n|Ship crew=\n|Ship notes=}}\n|}\nThe '''MV ''North Head''''' (formerly SS '''''Barrenjoey''''') was a ferry operated by the [[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]] and its successors on the [[Manly ferry services|Manly service]] from 1913 until 1985. \n\nThe vessel was launched as ''Barrenjoey'', a steamer and one of the six \"Binngarra\" type Manly ferries which were built between 1905 and 1922.  In 1951, she was converted to diesel-electric power, completely rebuilt and renamed ''North Head''. She was removed from service in 1985 following the introduction of the [[Freshwater-class ferry|Freshwater class ferries]]. She spent time in Hobart as a floating restaurant, and in 2000, she was taken to [[Cairns]] where she remains grounded and in deteriorating condition.\n\nThe name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. \"North Head\" is [[North Head, New South Wales|the northern headland]] at the entrance to [[Sydney Harbour]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kuringgai Flickr.jpg|thumb|left|''Kuring-gai'' (1901) was the forerunner to the \"Bingarra-type\" vessels including ''Barrenjoey''. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to ''Barrenjoey''{{'}}s at the ends of the sun deck.]]\n\nThe Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in [[Sydney Cove]] - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the properous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing enginee size and power. \n\nThe first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative [[Walter Reeks]]\u2013designed vessels; the ''[[SS Manly]]'' (1896), and ''[[SS Kuring-gai]]'' (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \"Binggarra-class\" ferries. They both had high [[forecastle]]s at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the [[Sydney Heads]]. The steel-hulled ''Kuring-gai'' was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. ''Manly'' and ''Kuring-gai'' had both, however, followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels. Whereas the \"Binggarra-class\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their promenade decks. \n\nThe \"''Binngarra''-class\" ferries, ''[[Binngarra]]'' (1905), ''[[Burra-Bra]]'' (1908), ''[[Bellubera]]'' (1910), ''[[SS Balgowlah|Balgowlah]]'' (1912), ''Barrenjoey'' (1913), and ''[[Baragoola]]'' (1922), were designed by [[Mort's Dock and Engineering]], initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie.

Upgrades to ''Bellubera'' and ''Baragoola'' in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. ''Bellubera'' was withdrawn from service in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in Decemeber 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey''/''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \n\u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 a.m. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu''{{'}}s upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head''{{'}}s wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "name_user": "DocWatson42", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected a misspelling.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_North_Head"}

The Act allocated funds from the [[Land and Water Conservation Fund]] (LWCF) for the purchase of wetlands by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]], who is head of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. The Act also instituted a National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan which was to be established and set up by the Secretary. Included in this plan was a requirement for all States to include wetlands as part of their Comprehensive Outdoors Recreation plan. The plan also transferred the [[Migratory Bird Conservation Fund]] amounts which were to be equal to the [[import duties]] on arms and [[ammunition]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/EMWET.HTML |title=Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 |publisher=Fws.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> The main purpose of the Act was to ensure a follow through on international obligations and fulfillment of these obligations on the various past and future migratory bird treaties.

Funds collected from these entrance fees were to be split, with 70% going to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and 30% to the maintenance and operation of the refuges. The cost of [[Federal Duck Stamps]] were also increased from $7.50 to $15.00, this was to be phased in through 1991. The sale of Federal Duck Stamps to raise money for the conservation of migratory birds was established in 1929 by the [[Migratory Bird Conservation Act]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nLater amendments to the Act allowed the establishment of Demonstration Fee programs. These fee programs established entrance and recreational use fees that allowed refuges and area agencies that participated in the programs to retain 80% of all fees collected. This of course superseded the 70/30 fee allocation that was first set up by the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986. The amendments were added to the Act through the Interior Appropriation Act Sec. 315 FY 1996 (P.L. 104-4; 110 Stat. 1321), as amended by P.L. 104-28 (110 Stat. 3009), P.L. 105-18, (111 Stat. 158) and P.L. 105-83 (111 Stat. 1543).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==The Act of 1986 Chapter 59==\n\n===Subchapter I \u2013 General Provisions===\n\nSubchapter I of the Act known as 16 U.S.C \u00a7 3901 - 3902 outlines the findings, purposes, and definitions of the Act. Congress found that wetlands played a pivotal role in not only the economics of the Nation but also the health, safety, recreations, and well-being of the citizens as well. Wetlands also provided major contributions to our food supply, water supply/quality, flood control, fish, wildlife, and plant resources.[[File:Aerial-view-of-marsh.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial View of Marsh]]\n\nFederal protection of wetlands for migratory birds was also a major finding, in order to uphold the Nations commitment to the migratory bird treaties with other nations like [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (U.S.S.R.), and several other countries in the [[Western Hemisphere]] protection was needed to ensure migratory bird populations stayed at a sustainable level as wetlands are the major sources for breeding, wintering, and migration.\n\nWith obligations to other countries and a clearer understanding of how important wetlands are to the well-being of society and to the overall health of the ecosystem the major purpose of the Act was the promotion and conservation of the Nations wetlands. This would ensure that no further damage would be done and the benefits that wetlands provide would be maintained.
