This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s had been known to cause [[tonic tensor tympani syndrome]] (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nIn many people with [[hyperacusis]], an increased activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear as part of the startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called [[tonic tensor tympani syndrome]] (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).\n\nThe mechanisms behind dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle and their consequences are hypotheses. However, in a published study, researchers studied the case of an acoustic shock whose mechanisms suggest dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle. This study appears to be the first to provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (e.g. tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with substances P and CGRP were found in close proximity.<ref>Londero A, Charpentier N, Ponsot D, Fournier P, Pezard L and Nore\u00f1a AJ (2017) A Case of Acoustic Shock with Post-trauma Trigeminal-Autonomic Activation.

Incarcerated into Chiang Mai prison, he is quickly subjugated to the horrors of Thai prison life, including being moved into a crowded mass cell ruled by cell boss Keng, forced to sleep next to a corpse and witnessing at knifepoint the rape of a fellow inmate. Billy\u2019s experiences with the other prisoners and personnel are tense, at one point going into a violent frenzy and biting into the neck of a prison guard after being refused painkillers. Following his punishment, he befriends transgender prisoner Fame. Life in prison worsens for Billy, and he retreats into heavy ya ba abuse; he subsequently beats two Muslim chefs half to death after being bribed by a corrupt prison guard. \n\nBilly\u2019s psyche finally breaks and he attempts suicide by slitting his wrist, though he survives. With a desperate need to fight again and battle his demons, he eventually joins the boxing team with the help of Fame, whom he later develops a romance with. Billy quickly adapts to the art of [[Muay Thai]] kickboxing and is able to win his first bout. Impressed by his performance, prison warden Officer Preecha has him transferred into the boxing team cell, with him being the first foreigner to compete in the national Muay Thai tournament and represent the prison. There he soon develops a comradery with the other boxers, receiving a tattoo on his back. However, he is ambushed by Keng and his gang, who threaten him with a [[pin prick attack]] if he loses the tournament. Even worse, it is established that Billy is suffering from hernia due to his drug abuse, and any subsequent damage could result in serious internal bleeding. Regardless, he still desires to compete. The resulting match is grueling for Billy, as he takes multiple shots to his stomach and is also fouled by his opponent. However, using what he learnt, he manages to knock his opponent out with a spinning back elbow and wins the fight. Despite the victory, the physical trauma is too much, and Billy ends up vomiting blood and passing out.\n\nBilly is quickly rushed to hospital, and after waking up, he sneaks out of the building and into the cityscape. Billy soon reconsiders his actions and returns back to the hospital. After being transferred, he reunites with his father, where the two exchange a solemn smile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]] as [[Billy Moore (author)|Billy Moore]]\n* Pornchanok Mabklang as Fame\n* Panya Yimmumphai as Keng\n* [[Somluck Kamsing]] as Trainer \n* Vithaya Pansringarm as Officer Preecha\n* Billy Moore as Billy's Father\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2014, it was announced [[Charlie Hunnam]] would star in the film, with Jean-St\u00e9phane Sauvaire directing from a screenplay written by Jonathan Hirschbein and Nick Saltrese, based upon a memoir written by Billy Moore.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing.

The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [[Weaning]] takes place around three months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing.
