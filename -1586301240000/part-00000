Sonya and her husband, Greg, featured in season 3 of Outback Truckers. Outback Truckers Noelene Turner died in 2014. She left behind her outback trucking husband Bluesy. In 2015, season 1 trucker Dougal Brett was killed when the helicopter he was piloting, crashed on his cattle station.\n\nIn season 5, one of Mackay & Sons' non-trucking worker was pinned under a house during a removal operation in suburban Brisbane. He was sent to hospital with minor lacerations and breathing difficulties. He recovered a month later, but was not featured in the work shown in the shows in season 5. He returned in season 6.\n\nJeff Elliot from Season 5 was one of the founding members of the British and European Custom Truck Scene, and won many awards at major shows in the 1980s for his custom fabrication and airbrush skills. Later in the 1980s he concentrated on international truck driving and did many long trips, with destinations as far and wide as Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and even did regular trips to the Chinese border at Corgos.  In the late 1990s he moved to Australia and operated a very successful air brush business, but has now returned to full-time truck driving. On his debut in season 5, he was a fresh seafood freighter.\n\n== Relation to other series ==\nIn season 5, government has released land to [[Coober Pedy, South Australia|Coober Pedy]] (South Australia) for the mining of [[opal]]s in 2017, and, and Mark Cromwell was seen sending mining machinery to the mines. In 2018, it spawn the spinoff series: [[Outback Opal Hunters]].\n\n== Reception ==\n''Outback Truckers'' was favourably reviewed by the press. Melinda Houston from The [[Sydney Morning Herald]]'s 'Critics Choice' noted that \"they're great stories well told from a part of the country and a way of life most of us will never otherwise experience\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/critics-choice-the-week-ahead-in-tv-20121013-27ji2.html |title=Critic's choice: the week ahead in TV |last=Houston |first=Melinda |publisher=The [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref> It was also praised in ''[[The West Australian]]'' for its various close ties with [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/15164003/kings-and-queens-of-the-road/ |title=Kings and Queens of the road |last=Brown |first=Pat |publisher=[[The West Australian]] |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref> News Limited's 'Switch On' gave it a 4/5 rating, one of the week's highest scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/television-the-week-ahead/story-fn948wjf-1226497603021 |title=Television: The week ahead |last=Butler |first=Dianne |publisher=News Limited |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Viewers ==\n\n=== Season 1 (2014) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px; width:25px;\" | No.\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Multichannel ranking (Australia)\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Original air\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Australian viewers\n|-\n| 1\n| < 20\n| 20 October 2012\n| \u2264 149,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?/topic/23187-saturday-20th-october/ |title=Saturday 20th October |publisher=MediaSpy |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2\n| 5\n| 27 October 2012\n| 187,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?/topic/23200-saturday-27th-october/ |title=Saturday 27th October |publisher=MediaSpy |date=29 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 3\n| 4\n| 3 November 2012\n| 220,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?/topic/23214-saturday-3rd-november/ |title=Saturday 3rd November |publisher=MediaSpy |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 4\n| 16\n| 10 November 2012\n| 162,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?/topic/23229-saturday-10th-november/ |title=Saturday 10th November |publisher=MediaSpy |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 5\n| < 20\n| 17 November 2012\n| \u2264 160,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?/topic/23240-saturday-17th-november/ |title=Saturday 17th November |publisher=MediaSpy |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n|}\n\n== International broadcasting ==\nThe following table lists the countries in which ''Outback Truckers'' airs outside Australia.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He\u2019s got to get his convoy half way across the Australian continent to the middle of the desert.\n\nClare and Mark are a trucking couple who complete one of the longest cross country supply runs in the world. Every six weeks they drive as many kilometres as the circumference of the Earth. The distance they can handle, crazy motorists drive them mad and driving level crossings under lights and 10&nbsp;km above the speed limit.\n\nGordon and Shui run road-trains to mining outposts in Australia\u2019s remote north. Working around the clock, beating fire and floods.\nTeeming summer rain is already playing havoc with the schedule of long distance truckie, Mark Bolitho, as he prepares for a marathon five-day trek across the Australian continent. It\u2019s been a good run so far but there are signs of trouble up ahead. A severe thunderstorm with hail, gale force winds and flash flooding hits the truck.\n\nOn the edge of the Central Australian desert, Richo\u2019s convoy prepare to hit the dirt roads. It\u2019s going to be a tough ride for his most trusted driver, \"Yeti\".\nUp north on the coast road, Shui\u2019s losing patience with a slower road train but overtaking in these elongated rigs is a tricky operation. And it\u2019s not helped by two fellow truckies tying up the CB radio.\nFor Richo\u2019s convoy, rains have closed several roads. Yeti\u2019s truck is in the lead but it\u2019s been badly shaken up.\n\nClare and Mark are about to hit the endless straight of the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. No corners to worry about, just cars that don\u2019t understand trucks. Richo decides he\u2019ll stay at the small town of [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]] with part of his convoy and send two trucks of perishable goods to see if they can get through. It\u2019s not long before conditions start to deteriorate. Patches of water suddenly become lakes of unknown depth. He\u2019s only 21 but Yeti is already a veteran of the deepwater crossing. The trucks make it through, but they\u2019ve taken a hammering. Time to give the boss back at Warburton some more bad news. Yeti will have to sit tight, camp out while Richo organises a replacement truck. The breakdown has already cost them precious time and with freezers packed with cold goods, sitting around in 40 degree heat isn\u2019t an option. Yeti\u2019s makes it to his destination. The unload is going smoothly until the shopkeeper notices something isn\u2019t right \u2013 the truck\u2019s freezers have not been working. Two hundred kilometres down the road, melting ice cream is the last of Richo\u2019s problems. He has a $3000 a day crane parked and idle. He needs to get it back to its owner before it sends him broke.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Episode 2\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|10|27}}\n |ShortSummary=In Perth lone trucking operator Steve Grahame is preparing for an epic journey. A 3000-kilometre trek to the top of Western Australia. Steve\u2019s a veteran driver with a reputation for getting trucks and goods into places no one else can.\n\nDeb Drew\u2019s got herself a new career. In her previous life she was a model a mother and a business woman. Now she\u2019s a truck driver. She and driving partner Damo are about to set off on a trip to the dead centre of Australia, when they get a late change to their destination. They now need to head to Darwin adding three thousand kilometres to their journey and two days in the driving seat\nSteve Grahame has been driving for two days. His old engine has had a bad oil leak for the entire trip. If it\u2019s as bad as Steve suspects the engine could explode and the whole trip go up in smoke\nIn Perth Mark Bolitho is getting his rig ready for another 7000 kilometre cross continent trip to Melbourne and back. Riding alongside on the trip will be mark\u2019s driving partner, Clare and their dog, Roy, who never misses a trip.\n\nDeb\u2019s having trouble with the gears on her truck. She\u2019s not used to a manual. With a further delay they are now starting 5 hours late really putting the pressure on. Then on the outskirts of Melbourne, the boss calls.\n\nOn a mountainside Steve's road train is giving him all the wrong signals. His road train is fighting a mountain and the mountain is winning. If the hill wins and the truck stops, he\u2019s got a whole new battle on his hands.\n\nClare and Mark\u2019s road train hits the edge of the vast Nullarbor Plain. Also on the road are two oversize trucks carrying mining equipment. Getting past them in a road train is going to be tricky.\nSteve\u2019s road train is stuck on the side of a hill. He was only a few metres from making it over the crest but now he\u2019s got the back-breaking job of uncoupling the trailers and pulling them over the top one by one.\n\nMark and Clare have swapped drivers but while they were stopped, they were passed by the same wide load they overtook earlier. Clare\u2019s flying blind, relying on someone else\u2019s judgement on how safe it is to overtake. Turns out it\u2019s not safe at all.\n\nThe light is just starting to go when Steve crosses the Barnett River. It\u2019s recently been in flood and there\u2019s heavy sand on the riverbed that traps Steve\u2019s truck. The fix could be as simple as shovelling some of the sand away. He can\u2019t leave the truck straddling the river over night. There\u2019s time for one last try. If this fails he\u2019s in serious trouble.\nOn the edge of the Central Australian desert Deb\u2019s worried about the number of animals she\u2019s passing on the roadside. No cattle but plenty of sheep close to the road and three that decide they want to cross in front of her.\n\nBack on the highway Mark and Clare have two problems \u2013 Roy\u2019s playing up and the wide load they\u2019ve passed twice already has passed them again. Last time Clare was called through there was a truck coming, this time they find another way to annoy her.\n\nSteve is tantalizingly close to his destination\u2014only a hundred kilometres away. But he\u2019s still not confident to push his truck through on the muddy track. To make matters worse he has a slow-leaking tyre that he has to change. The community he\u2019s supplying is so close that reinforcements arrive. It\u2019s a long shot but maybe four-wheel drives can pull him free.\nSteve is eventually out but soon he hits another bog. As a last-ditch attempt, a grader is sent to try to pull him through. It\u2019s a dangerous job and it\u2019s Steve\u2019s last hope.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Episode 3\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|3}}\n |ShortSummary=Mark King is a heavy haulage specialist that has to haul a monster rig to a coal mine 700 kilometres away. It's too big for the road and there\u2019s a mountain range to cross.\nIn the wilds of north Western Australia, veteran truckie Steve Grahame is in the middle of an epic journey, trying to deliver essential supplies to a remote community, but the weather and roads are conspiring against him.\n\nIn the central Australian desert on the road to Alice Springs, ex-model turned truckie Deb Drew is into the fourth day of a 7000-kilometre trek from Melbourne to Darwin and back.\nSteve Grahame has been trying for more than a week to get his road train into [[Kalumburu, Western Australia|Kalumburu]] and he\u2019s stuck just 70 kilometres from his destination. But on these tracks travelling 100 metres can take more than a day. The whole community is relying on Steve to make it through. He\u2019s carrying critical building supplies and food to fill the empty shelves of the local store.\n\nMark King is a man with a mission \u2013 to get an eight-and-a-half-meter-wide, 100-tonne mining dump truck from Brisbane to the booming coalfields of Rollestone. Problem is he has to navigate the monster rig through [[Toowoomba]]\u2019s great dividing range. To add more pressure to an already impossible deadline the convoy can only travel through the city at night.\nDeb\u2019s got a plan to mix a little pleasure with the business of driving and make an unscheduled stop at a place she\u2019s always wanted to see, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock). But Deb has spotted a problem with one of her trailers and gets some unwanted attention from the law.\n\nSteve Grahame\u2019s road train has been stranded at a remote cattle station. Persistent rain has been filling up a bog hole that he needs to get through. Graders have been working at the hole and the sun has dried it out, to the point where Steve\u2019s ready to risk running his road train at it. There\u2019s no way he can turn his road train around out here so his decision is crucial, turn left and take on the bog hole, turn right and try a longer way.\n\nIn the small hours of the morning Mark King\u2019s oversize load has hit a roadblock. No one told him about a new road surface being laid on the highway by a machine that\u2019s taking up the two lanes he needs to get by. There\u2019s a stand off between the road crew and Mark\u2019s crew. The delay is costing them precious time. If they\u2019re not out of the city by sun-up they break the curfew, and the police could order them to stop, leaving the rig stranded.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Episode 4\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|10}}\n |ShortSummary=Dougal Brett is one unusual truckie, he flies his own helicopter, owns a cattle station the size of a small country and a fleet of livestock trucks. His road trains have to haul 1500 cattle to a market nearly 3000 kilometres away. He\u2019s depending on the sale of his cattle to pay bills that have been piling up since the previous season when a live-export ban crippled the market. But the dirt tracks off his remote station are wet and getting wetter.\n\nHeavy haulage driver, Mark King is half-way through a marathon job. He\u2019s in charge of getting a monster mining truck from Brisbane to the central Queensland coal fields, 700 kilometres away. He has the equivalent of over 100 cars sitting on the back of his truck. But weight is not his only problem. Mark\u2019s convoy has to cross a series of mountain passes. The conditions of the road allow no margin for error. There\u2019s a police and pilot escort to help him but it\u2019s the driver who gets blamed if anything goes wrong.\n\nOn a lonely dirt road at the top of north Western Australia, veteran Perth truckie Steve Grahame is a broken man. After an epic 3000-kilometre trek from Perth to the remote coastal community of [[Kalumburu, Western Australia|Kalumburu]], he\u2019s fallen just 50 kilometres short of his destination. Part of a dirt track has collapsed under the weight of his 100-tonne road train, burying the last two trailers up to their axles. Graders will try to pull him out. If this last attempt fails, Steve\u2019s trailers could be stuck here for the entire wet season.\n\nAt Waterloo Station, the rain that stopped Dougal Brett from loading his cattle has cleared. The race is now on to get the cattle rounded up and into trucks before more wet-season rain makes the muddy roads even wetter. Driving cattle trucks with three double-decker trailers, carrying over 200 swaying animals is regarded as one of the toughest trucking jobs\nthere is. And on bad roads, it's twice as tough.\n\nOn the road to the Rolleston coal mine in central Queensland, Mark King is worried about the heat. Temperatures have passed the 40-degree mark and that's doing dangerous things to the road surface. Mark is worried his rig\u2019s 180-tonne weight and 650-horsepower engine could start ripping up the melting road from underneath him.\nSteve Grahame has crossed the last flooded river between him and his destination of Kalumburu. But his water worries are far from over, a massive storm\u2019s come out of nowhere. After a three-week struggle Steve\u2019s truck is bogged again just walking distance from his destination.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title=Episode 5\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary=In far North Queensland, tanker driver Steve Hughes is loading up for a supply run to remote clients who need fuel before the wet season cuts them off.\nAt a Perth freight depot tempers are fraying. Husband and wife team, Gordon and Shui, have just finished a two-day non-stop drive but bad weather\u2019s caused them delays. Instead of resting at home, the boss has told them to turn around and do it all again.\n\nAt the edge of the desert of the Nullarbor Plain, long-distance husband and wife trucking team Mark and Clare Bolitho are 8 hours into their weekly cross continent run. Riding with them on every trip is their 16-year-old dog Roy.\n\nSteve and his 28,000-litre load of fuel are heading up a mountain pass. With 20 tonnes of fuel on board, Steve\u2019s tanker strains on the steep incline. All he can do is watch, as car after car tries to squeeze past. Then one driver pushes his luck too far.\nGordon and Shui are monitoring the sky for signs of the cyclone that\u2019s already played havoc with their schedule. Heavy rain has washed away large chunks of the highway.\n\nBlinding rain is making life hard for tanker driver Steve. His run is taking him deep into the tropical wilderness. Where roads become dirt tracks that can disappear under water in minutes.\n\nBack on the Nullarbor Plain, Roy isn\u2019t enjoying the ride. He\u2019s not been himself for most of the journey. Clare\u2019s increasingly worried. Out here there are no vets.\nSomething is troubling Shui. One of the loads looked to have shifted even worse, something could have fallen off.\nGordon and Shui have hit a flooded five-hundred-metre stretch of highway in front of them. Shui has to try to avoid the holes where the road has been washed out. If she drives too close to the edge of the bitumen, she risks ending up in the river. Their trip from hell is about to get worse. They arrive at their destination just as it\u2019s being savaged by the fringes of the cyclone. They need an address for another trailer pick-up. But the depot\u2019s deserted.\n\nWithout checking the roads up ahead this is as far as Steve is prepared to go in his fuel tanker. He drives to the banks of a swollen river he can\u2019t cross. The station owner knows it\u2019s a lost cause. Steve can\u2019t deliver and heads for home before more rain arrives.\n\nAfter driving for two days, Mark and Clare have arrived in [[Adelaide]]. But the only cargo they\u2019re worried about is Roy. He needs to get to a vet quickly.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 2 (2014) ===\n<onlyinclude>{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | No.\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=Episode 1\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2014|2|06}}\n |ShortSummary= Outback legend Steve Grahame is hauling three million dollars-worth of vital power generating equipment to an isolated community in the far North West of Australia - Kalumburu.\n |LineColor=#EF7F3E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Episode 2\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2014|4|14}}\n |ShortSummary= It's mid-afternoon in Perth and Dion's super size convoy is pushing hard to get out of the city before sunset.

He\u2019s got to get his convoy half way across the Australian continent to the middle of the desert.\n\nClare and Mark are a trucking couple who complete one of the longest cross country supply runs in the world. Every six weeks they drive as many kilometres as the circumference of the Earth. The distance they can handle, crazy motorists drive them mad and driving level crossings under lights and 10&nbsp;km above the speed limit.\n\nGordon and Shui run road-trains to mining outposts in Australia\u2019s remote north. Working around the clock, beating fire and floods.\nTeeming summer rain is already playing havoc with the schedule of long distance truckie, Mark Bolitho, as he prepares for a marathon five-day trek across the Australian continent. It\u2019s been a good run so far but there are signs of trouble up ahead. A severe thunderstorm with hail, gale force winds and flash flooding hits the truck.\n\nOn the edge of the Central Australian desert, Richo\u2019s convoy prepare to hit the dirt roads. It\u2019s going to be a tough ride for his most trusted driver, \"Yeti\".\nUp north on the coast road, Shui\u2019s losing patience with a slower road train but overtaking in these elongated rigs is a tricky operation. And it\u2019s not helped by two fellow truckies tying up the CB radio.\nFor Richo\u2019s convoy, rains have closed several roads. Yeti\u2019s truck is in the lead but it\u2019s been badly shaken up.\n\nClare and Mark are about to hit the endless straight of the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. No corners to worry about, just cars that don\u2019t understand trucks. Richo decides he\u2019ll stay at the small town of [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]] with part of his convoy and send two trucks of perishable goods to see if they can get through. It\u2019s not long before conditions start to deteriorate. Patches of water suddenly become lakes of unknown depth. He\u2019s only 21 but Yeti is already a veteran of the deepwater crossing. The trucks make it through, but they\u2019ve taken a hammering. Time to give the boss back at Warburton some more bad news. Yeti will have to sit tight, camp out while Richo organises a replacement truck. The breakdown has already cost them precious time and with freezers packed with cold goods, sitting around in 40 degree heat isn\u2019t an option. Yeti\u2019s makes it to his destination. The unload is going smoothly until the shopkeeper notices something isn\u2019t right \u2013 the truck\u2019s freezers have not been working. Two hundred kilometres down the road, melting ice cream is the last of Richo\u2019s problems. He has a $3000 a day crane parked and idle. He needs to get it back to its owner before it sends him broke.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Episode 2\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|10|27}}\n |ShortSummary=In Perth lone trucking operator Steve Grahame is preparing for an epic journey. A 3000-kilometre trek to the top of Western Australia. Steve\u2019s a veteran driver with a reputation for getting trucks and goods into places no one else can.\n\nDeb Drew\u2019s got herself a new career. In her previous life she was a model a mother and a business woman. Now she\u2019s a truck driver. She and driving partner Damo are about to set off on a trip to the dead centre of Australia, when they get a late change to their destination. They now need to head to Darwin adding three thousand kilometres to their journey and two days in the driving seat\nSteve Grahame has been driving for two days. His old engine has had a bad oil leak for the entire trip. If it\u2019s as bad as Steve suspects the engine could explode and the whole trip go up in smoke\nIn Perth Mark Bolitho is getting his rig ready for another 7000 kilometre cross continent trip to Melbourne and back. Riding alongside on the trip will be mark\u2019s driving partner, Clare and their dog, Roy, who never misses a trip.\n\nDeb\u2019s having trouble with the gears on her truck. She\u2019s not used to a manual. With a further delay they are now starting 5 hours late really putting the pressure on. Then on the outskirts of Melbourne, the boss calls.\n\nOn a mountainside Steve's road train is giving him all the wrong signals. His road train is fighting a mountain and the mountain is winning. If the hill wins and the truck stops, he\u2019s got a whole new battle on his hands.\n\nClare and Mark\u2019s road train hits the edge of the vast Nullarbor Plain. Also on the road are two oversize trucks carrying mining equipment. Getting past them in a road train is going to be tricky.\nSteve\u2019s road train is stuck on the side of a hill. He was only a few metres from making it over the crest but now he\u2019s got the back-breaking job of uncoupling the trailers and pulling them over the top one by one.\n\nMark and Clare have swapped drivers but while they were stopped, they were passed by the same wide load they overtook earlier. Clare\u2019s flying blind, relying on someone else\u2019s judgement on how safe it is to overtake. Turns out it\u2019s not safe at all.\n\nThe light is just starting to go when Steve crosses the Barnett River. It\u2019s recently been in flood and there\u2019s heavy sand on the riverbed that traps Steve\u2019s truck. The fix could be as simple as shovelling some of the sand away. He can\u2019t leave the truck straddling the river over night. There\u2019s time for one last try. If this fails he\u2019s in serious trouble.\nOn the edge of the Central Australian desert Deb\u2019s worried about the number of animals she\u2019s passing on the roadside. No cattle but plenty of sheep close to the road and three that decide they want to cross in front of her.\n\nBack on the highway Mark and Clare have two problems \u2013 Roy\u2019s playing up and the wide load they\u2019ve passed twice already has passed them again. Last time Clare was called through there was a truck coming, this time they find another way to annoy her.\n\nSteve is tantalizingly close to his destination\u2014only a hundred kilometres away. But he\u2019s still not confident to push his truck through on the muddy track. To make matters worse he has a slow-leaking tyre that he has to change. The community he\u2019s supplying is so close that reinforcements arrive. It\u2019s a long shot but maybe four-wheel drives can pull him free.\nSteve is eventually out but soon he hits another bog. As a last-ditch attempt, a grader is sent to try to pull him through. It\u2019s a dangerous job and it\u2019s Steve\u2019s last hope.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Episode 3\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|3}}\n |ShortSummary=Mark King is a heavy haulage specialist that has to haul a monster rig to a coal mine 700 kilometres away. It's too big for the road and there\u2019s a mountain range to cross.\nIn the wilds of north Western Australia, veteran truckie Steve Grahame is in the middle of an epic journey, trying to deliver essential supplies to a remote community, but the weather and roads are conspiring against him.\n\nIn the central Australian desert on the road to Alice Springs, ex-model turned truckie Deb Drew is into the fourth day of a 7000-kilometre trek from Melbourne to Darwin and back.\nSteve Grahame has been trying for more than a week to get his road train into [[Kalumburu, Western Australia|Kalumburu]] and he\u2019s stuck just 70 kilometres from his destination. But on these tracks travelling 100 metres can take more than a day. The whole community is relying on Steve to make it through. He\u2019s carrying critical building supplies and food to fill the empty shelves of the local store.\n\nMark King is a man with a mission \u2013 to get an eight-and-a-half-meter-wide, 100-tonne mining dump truck from Brisbane to the booming coalfields of Rollestone. Problem is he has to navigate the monster rig through [[Toowoomba]]\u2019s great dividing range. To add more pressure to an already impossible deadline the convoy can only travel through the city at night.\nDeb\u2019s got a plan to mix a little pleasure with the business of driving and make an unscheduled stop at a place she\u2019s always wanted to see, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock). But Deb has spotted a problem with one of her trailers and gets some unwanted attention from the law.\n\nSteve Grahame\u2019s road train has been stranded at a remote cattle station. Persistent rain has been filling up a bog hole that he needs to get through. Graders have been working at the hole and the sun has dried it out, to the point where Steve\u2019s ready to risk running his road train at it. There\u2019s no way he can turn his road train around out here so his decision is crucial, turn left and take on the bog hole, turn right and try a longer way.\n\nIn the small hours of the morning Mark King\u2019s oversize load has hit a roadblock. No one told him about a new road surface being laid on the highway by a machine that\u2019s taking up the two lanes he needs to get by. There\u2019s a stand off between the road crew and Mark\u2019s crew. The delay is costing them precious time. If they\u2019re not out of the city by sun-up they break the curfew, and the police could order them to stop, leaving the rig stranded.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Episode 4\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|10}}\n |ShortSummary=Dougal Brett is one unusual truckie, he flies his own helicopter, owns a cattle station the size of a small country and a fleet of livestock trucks. His road trains have to haul 1500 cattle to a market nearly 3000 kilometres away. He\u2019s depending on the sale of his cattle to pay bills that have been piling up since the previous season when a live-export ban crippled the market. But the dirt tracks off his remote station are wet and getting wetter.\n\nHeavy haulage driver, Mark King is half-way through a marathon job. He\u2019s in charge of getting a monster mining truck from Brisbane to the central Queensland coal fields, 700 kilometres away. He has the equivalent of over 100 cars sitting on the back of his truck. But weight is not his only problem. Mark\u2019s convoy has to cross a series of mountain passes. The conditions of the road allow no margin for error. There\u2019s a police and pilot escort to help him but it\u2019s the driver who gets blamed if anything goes wrong.\n\nOn a lonely dirt road at the top of north Western Australia, veteran Perth truckie Steve Grahame is a broken man. After an epic 3000-kilometre trek from Perth to the remote coastal community of [[Kalumburu, Western Australia|Kalumburu]], he\u2019s fallen just 50 kilometres short of his destination. Part of a dirt track has collapsed under the weight of his 100-tonne road train, burying the last two trailers up to their axles. Graders will try to pull him out. If this last attempt fails, Steve\u2019s trailers could be stuck here for the entire wet season.\n\nAt Waterloo Station, the rain that stopped Dougal Brett from loading his cattle has cleared. The race is now on to get the cattle rounded up and into trucks before more wet-season rain makes the muddy roads even wetter. Driving cattle trucks with three double-decker trailers, carrying over 200 swaying animals is regarded as one of the toughest trucking jobs\nthere is. And on bad roads, it's twice as tough.\n\nOn the road to the Rolleston coal mine in central Queensland, Mark King is worried about the heat. Temperatures have passed the 40-degree mark and that's doing dangerous things to the road surface. Mark is worried his rig\u2019s 180-tonne weight and 650-horsepower engine could start ripping up the melting road from underneath him.\nSteve Grahame has crossed the last flooded river between him and his destination of Kalumburu. But his water worries are far from over, a massive storm\u2019s come out of nowhere. After a three-week struggle Steve\u2019s truck is bogged again just walking distance from his destination.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title=Episode 5\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2012|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary=In far North Queensland, tanker driver Steve Hughes is loading up for a supply run to remote clients who need fuel before the wet season cuts them off.\nAt a Perth freight depot tempers are fraying. Husband and wife team, Gordon and Shui, have just finished a two-day non-stop drive but bad weather\u2019s caused them delays. Instead of resting at home, the boss has told them to turn around and do it all again.\n\nAt the edge of the desert of the Nullarbor Plain, long-distance husband and wife trucking team Mark and Clare Bolitho are 8 hours into their weekly cross continent run. Riding with them on every trip is their 16-year-old dog Roy.\n\nSteve and his 28,000-litre load of fuel are heading up a mountain pass. With 20 tonnes of fuel on board, Steve\u2019s tanker strains on the steep incline. All he can do is watch, as car after car tries to squeeze past. Then one driver pushes his luck too far.\nGordon and Shui are monitoring the sky for signs of the cyclone that\u2019s already played havoc with their schedule. Heavy rain has washed away large chunks of the highway.\n\nBlinding rain is making life hard for tanker driver Steve. His run is taking him deep into the tropical wilderness. Where roads become dirt tracks that can disappear under water in minutes.\n\nBack on the Nullarbor Plain, Roy isn\u2019t enjoying the ride. He\u2019s not been himself for most of the journey. Clare\u2019s increasingly worried. Out here there are no vets.\nSomething is troubling Shui. One of the loads looked to have shifted even worse, something could have fallen off.\nGordon and Shui have hit a flooded five-hundred-metre stretch of highway in front of them. Shui has to try to avoid the holes where the road has been washed out. If she drives too close to the edge of the bitumen, she risks ending up in the river. Their trip from hell is about to get worse. They arrive at their destination just as it\u2019s being savaged by the fringes of the cyclone. They need an address for another trailer pick-up. But the depot\u2019s deserted.\n\nWithout checking the roads up ahead this is as far as Steve is prepared to go in his fuel tanker. He drives to the banks of a swollen river he can\u2019t cross. The station owner knows it\u2019s a lost cause. Steve can\u2019t deliver and heads for home before more rain arrives.\n\nAfter driving for two days, Mark and Clare have arrived in [[Adelaide]]. But the only cargo they\u2019re worried about is Roy. He needs to get to a vet quickly.\n |LineColor=B60000\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 2 (2014) ===\n<onlyinclude>{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | No.\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#EF7F3E; color:white;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=Episode 1\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2014|2|06}}\n |ShortSummary= Outback legend Steve Grahame is hauling three million dollars-worth of vital power generating equipment to an isolated community in the far North West of Australia - Kalumburu.\n |LineColor=#EF7F3E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Outback Truckers\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Episode 2\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|df=yes|2014|4|14}}\n |ShortSummary= It's mid-afternoon in Perth and Dion's super size convoy is pushing hard to get out of the city before sunset.

At the age of six, Hartley began his motor racing career in [[kart racing]], following in his brother Nelson's footsteps. Six years later, he competed in his first full-scale race championship, competing in the Formula First category. Hartley finished the season in seventh. In 2003, he won that year's New Zealand [[Formula Ford]] Festival which resulted in him getting a drive for the following year's Formula Ford championship. In a car his brother had used the previous year, he started four races and won two of them.\n\nAfter a season in [[Toyota Racing Series|Formula Toyota New Zealand]], Hartley moved to [[Europe]], competing in the [[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]] and [[Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup]] (NEC). He finished 14th and 10th in the Drivers' Championship in the Eurocup and North European Cup respectively, taking a podium position at [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] in the latter. In his second year in [[Formula Renault]], he stayed in the Eurocup, but moved from the NEC to the [[Italian Formula Renault Championship|Italian championship]]. He took three wins in the Eurocup and three podiums in the Italian championship, and took the championship title in the Eurocup.\n\nIn 2007 Hartley also made his [[Formula Three]] debut in the [[Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Zolder]] event, finishing 4th. This resulted in a test with [[A1 Team New Zealand]] and the role of the rookie driver for the series. In [[2008 British Formula 3 season|2008]], he competed in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] for [[Carlin Motorsport]], winning five times, and eventually finished the championship in third.

At the age of six, Hartley began his motor racing career in [[kart racing]], following in his brother Nelson's footsteps. Six years later, he competed in his first full-scale race championship, competing in the Formula First category. Hartley finished the season in seventh. In 2003, he won that year's New Zealand [[Formula Ford]] Festival which resulted in him getting a drive for the following year's Formula Ford championship. In a car his brother had used the previous year, he started four races and won two of them.\n\nAfter a season in [[Toyota Racing Series|Formula Toyota New Zealand]], Hartley moved to [[Europe]], competing in the [[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]] and [[Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup]] (NEC). He finished 14th and 10th in the Drivers' Championship in the Eurocup and North European Cup respectively, taking a podium position at [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] in the latter. In his second year in [[Formula Renault]], he stayed in the Eurocup, but moved from the NEC to the [[Italian Formula Renault Championship|Italian championship]]. He took three wins in the Eurocup and three podiums in the Italian championship, and took the championship title in the Eurocup.\n\nIn 2007 Hartley also made his [[Formula Three]] debut in the [[Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Zolder]] event, finishing 4th. This resulted in a test with [[A1 Team New Zealand]] and the role of the rookie driver for the series. In [[2008 British Formula 3 season|2008]], he competed in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] for [[Carlin Motorsport]], winning five times, and eventually finished the championship in third. He also competed in eight races in the [[2008 Formula Three Euroseries season|Formula Three Euroseries]] for Carlin and RC Motorsport, and achieved two finishes in the points, although he was ineligible for points. In non-championship races, Hartley finished fifth at the [[Masters of Formula 3]], and third at the Macau Grand Prix. After crashing in the qualification race, he started 20th on the grid and recorded the fastest race lap.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nHe stayed with Carlin for the full F3 Euroseries in [[2009 Formula Three Euroseries season|2009]],<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72598\n|title=Hartley goes Euro Series with Carlin\n|first=Jonathan\n|last=Noble\n|work=autosport.com\n|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]\n|date=31 December 2008\n|accessdate=7 January 2009}}</ref> finishing eleventh despite missing two rounds due to [[Formula Renault 3.5 Series]] commitments.

Vietnam Professional Football (VPF) was established in 2012, and the organising power was transferred from the [[Vietnam Football Federation]] (VFF) to VPF.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early days===\nThe V-League 1, as it is known today, dates back to 1980 when the first semi-professional league was launched (then known as the All Vietnam Football Championship). Seventeen clubs participated in the competition which was split into three groups and conducted more like a cup competition, with the winner from each group qualifying for the Championship Stage. C\u00f4ng An H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, [[Tong Cuc Duong Sat|T\u1ed5ng C\u1ee5c \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng S\u1eaft]] and [[H\u1ea3i Quan]] were the three teams to qualify, with T\u1ed5ng C\u1ee5c \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng S\u1eaft ultimately taking the title. That format, although the teams were split into two groups, continued until 1995 when the league reverted to a more traditional league format.\n\n===Turning professional===\nLeague football in Vietnam would turn professional in the 2000\u20132001 season, which saw the league change its name to its current moniker, V-League 1. In that inaugural V-League 1 season there were only ten clubs, with tighter restrictions meaning fewer teams. Over the next decade the league grew from 10 teams to the current fourteen, with the team that finishes on top of the table qualifying for the [[AFC Champions League]]. Clubs were allowed to hire foreign players from this season on.\n\n===VPF establishment===\nFollowing a season marred by accusations of refereeing corruption and a cover-up by the V.League governing body [[Vietnam Football Federation]] (VFF), six clubs (\u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m Long An, Ho\u00e0ng Anh Gia Lai, Hanoi ACB, Vissai Ninh B\u00ecnh, Khatoco Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a and Lam S\u01a1n Thanh H\u00f3a<ref name=\"sggp-oct4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Sport/2011/9/96959/ |title=Historic change: Company to run Vietnam football |access-date=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401134452/http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Sport/2011/9/96959/ |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) threatened to leave the league and form an entirely new league for the 2012 season. The most outspoken club in the move was Hanoi ACB, who were going through relegation from the V.League, with its chairman Nguyen Duc Kien announcing that ACB would spearhead the move. Due to the controversy, league sponsor [[Vietnam Export Import Commercial Joint Stock Bank|EximBank]] expressed its intention to drop its title sponsorship of the league. League officials scrambled to resolve the issues, going as far as hiring foreign referees for the 2012 season.<ref name=\"vleague6clubs\">{{cite web |url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/6-clubs-want-to-leave-v-league-set-up-own-league-1.43841 |title=6 clubs want to leave V-League, set up own league |publisher=Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb |date=10 September 2011 |access-date=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208100216/http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/6-clubs-want-to-leave-v-league-set-up-own-league-1.43841 |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"refereesusp\">{{cite web |url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/3-football-referees-suspended-for-dishonesty-1.42478 |title=3 football referees suspended for dishonesty |publisher=Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb |accessdate=29 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208100545/http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/3-football-referees-suspended-for-dishonesty-1.42478 |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After a meeting on 29 September, representatives of the VFF and the 14 '''V.League 1''' teams and 14 [[Vietnamese First Division|'''V.League 2''']] teams announced the formation of a new corporation, the VPF, Vietnam Professional Football Joint Stock Company to manage the V-League. The VFF would hold a 36% stake in the new corporation, and the rest would be held by clubs.<ref name=\"sggp-oct4\" />\n\nFrom the 2012 season, the organising power was transferred from the VFF to the VPF (Vietnamese Professional Football), and the V.League 1 was initially changed to the Super League, although this name was short-lived and the league was renamed back to V.League 1 later in the season. The first division was renamed the V.League 2. At the same time, many clubs found themselves in financial and sponsor issues, and many clubs withdrew, merge, bought another or failed to meet requirements for leagues. As a result, the number of clubs in each league changed dramatically.\n\n==Competition format==\n* The '''V.League 1''' season starts in February/March and ends in September.

It is contested by 14 clubs who play each other on a [[Home (sports)|home]] and [[Road (sports)|away]] basis. The team finishing at the top at the end of the season is crowned the champion and enters the [[AFC Champions League]].\n\nThe league was founded in [[1980 V-League|1980]] as the '''All Vietnam Football Championship''', with [[Tong Cuc Duong Sat|T\u1ed5ng C\u1ee5c \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng S\u1eaft]] emerging as the first winner. [[Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng F.C.|Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng]] is the most successful club in the league's history, having won the title five times. The league turned professional in the [[2000\u201301 V-League|2000\u20132001]] season, which allowed clubs to hire foreign players. Vietnam Professional Football (VPF) was established in 2012, and the organising power was transferred from the [[Vietnam Football Federation]] (VFF) to VPF.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early days===\nThe V-League 1, as it is known today, dates back to 1980 when the first semi-professional league was launched (then known as the All Vietnam Football Championship). Seventeen clubs participated in the competition which was split into three groups and conducted more like a cup competition, with the winner from each group qualifying for the Championship Stage. C\u00f4ng An H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, [[Tong Cuc Duong Sat|T\u1ed5ng C\u1ee5c \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng S\u1eaft]] and [[H\u1ea3i Quan]] were the three teams to qualify, with T\u1ed5ng C\u1ee5c \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng S\u1eaft ultimately taking the title. That format, although the teams were split into two groups, continued until 1995 when the league reverted to a more traditional league format.\n\n===Turning professional===\nLeague football in Vietnam would turn professional in the 2000\u20132001 season, which saw the league change its name to its current moniker, V-League 1. In that inaugural V-League 1 season there were only ten clubs, with tighter restrictions meaning fewer teams. Over the next decade the league grew from 10 teams to the current fourteen, with the team that finishes on top of the table qualifying for the [[AFC Champions League]]. Clubs were allowed to hire foreign players from this season on.\n\n===VPF establishment===\nFollowing a season marred by accusations of refereeing corruption and a cover-up by the V.League governing body [[Vietnam Football Federation]] (VFF), six clubs (\u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m Long An, Ho\u00e0ng Anh Gia Lai, Hanoi ACB, Vissai Ninh B\u00ecnh, Khatoco Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a and Lam S\u01a1n Thanh H\u00f3a<ref name=\"sggp-oct4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Sport/2011/9/96959/ |title=Historic change: Company to run Vietnam football |access-date=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401134452/http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Sport/2011/9/96959/ |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) threatened to leave the league and form an entirely new league for the 2012 season. The most outspoken club in the move was Hanoi ACB, who were going through relegation from the V.League, with its chairman Nguyen Duc Kien announcing that ACB would spearhead the move. Due to the controversy, league sponsor [[Vietnam Export Import Commercial Joint Stock Bank|EximBank]] expressed its intention to drop its title sponsorship of the league. League officials scrambled to resolve the issues, going as far as hiring foreign referees for the 2012 season.<ref name=\"vleague6clubs\">{{cite web |url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/6-clubs-want-to-leave-v-league-set-up-own-league-1.43841 |title=6 clubs want to leave V-League, set up own league |publisher=Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb |date=10 September 2011 |access-date=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208100216/http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/6-clubs-want-to-leave-v-league-set-up-own-league-1.43841 |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"refereesusp\">{{cite web |url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/3-football-referees-suspended-for-dishonesty-1.42478 |title=3 football referees suspended for dishonesty |publisher=Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb |accessdate=29 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208100545/http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/sports/3-football-referees-suspended-for-dishonesty-1.42478 |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After a meeting on 29 September, representatives of the VFF and the 14 '''V.League 1''' teams and 14 [[Vietnamese First Division|'''V.League 2''']] teams announced the formation of a new corporation, the VPF, Vietnam Professional Football Joint Stock Company to manage the V-League. The VFF would hold a 36% stake in the new corporation, and the rest would be held by clubs.<ref name=\"sggp-oct4\" />\n\nFrom the 2012 season, the organising power was transferred from the VFF to the VPF (Vietnamese Professional Football), and the V.League 1 was initially changed to the Super League, although this name was short-lived and the league was renamed back to V.League 1 later in the season. The first division was renamed the V.League 2. At the same time, many clubs found themselves in financial and sponsor issues, and many clubs withdrew, merge, bought another or failed to meet requirements for leagues. As a result, the number of clubs in each league changed dramatically.\n\n==Competition format==\n* The '''V.League 1''' season starts in February/March and ends in September. In each season, each club plays each of the other clubs twice, once at home and another away, for a total of 26 games.\n* Teams are ranked by total points, head-to-head, goal difference and goals scored.\n* Top team qualifies for [[AFC Champions League]] Prelim. Stage 2.\n* For 2010 season, two bottom teams are relegated to the [[Vietnam First Division]] while third lowest placed team goes to [[play-off]] with the third highest placed team from the First Division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vleague.vn/media/file/1261997078Dieu_le_giai_vleague_2010.pdf |format=pdf |title=V-League 2010 Regulations (Vietnamese)}}</ref>\n* Starting in the 2013 season, the number of clubs participating in the V.League 1 would be decreased from fourteen to twelve after three clubs failed to register.

Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.

It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units.

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system.

The highest rank in the Myanmar Army is Senior General, equivalent to [[Field Marshal]] position in Western Armies and is currently held by Min Aung Hlaing after being promoted from Vice-Senior General.\n \nIn 2011, following transition from military junta government to civilian parliamentary government, the Myanmar Army enacted a military draft for all citizens; all males from the age 18 to 35 and all females age between 18 and 27 years of age can be drafted into military service for two years as enlisted personnel in time of national emergency. The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.\n \nAn official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence. The Government Gazette reports that 1.8&nbsp;trillion kyat (about $2&nbsp;billion at free market rates of exchange), or 23.6 percent of the 2011 budget will go to defence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|title=Myanmar allocates 1/4 of new budget to military|date=1 March 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213807/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm#|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \n==Brief history==\n \n=== Post Independence era ===\n[[File:Myanmar Army personnel at Naypyidaw reception.jpg|thumb|Myanmar Army Honour Guards saluting the arrival of Thai delegation in October 2010.]]\n \nAt the time of Myanmar's independence in 1948, the Tatmadaw was weak, small and disunited. Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

In 1981, it was described as 'probably the best army in Southeast Asia, apart from Vietnam's'.<ref>''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', 20 May 1981</ref> The judgement was echoed in 1983, when another observer noted that \"Myanmar's infantry is generally rated as one of the toughest, most combat seasoned in Southeast Asia\".<ref>''[[Far Eastern Economic Review|FEER]]'', 7 July 1983</ref>\nIn 1985, a foreign journalist with the rare experience of seeing Burmese soldiers in action against ethnic insurgents and narco-armies was 'thoroughly impressed by their fighting skills, endurance and discipline'.<ref>[[Bertil Lintner]], ''Land of Jade''</ref> Other commentators throughout that time characterised the Myanmar Army as 'the toughest, most effective light infantry jungle force now operating in Southeast Asia'.<ref>''[[Asiaweek]]'' 21 February 1992</ref> Even the [[Thai people]], not known to praise the Burmese lightly, have described the Myanmar Army as 'skilled in the art of [[jungle warfare]]'.<ref>The Defence of Thailand (Thai Government issue), p.15, April 1995</ref>\n \n===Organisation===\n \nThe Myanmar Army had reached some 370,000 active troops in all ranks in the year 2000. There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units.

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets.
