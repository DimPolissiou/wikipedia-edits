The Cavaliers and Hokies had a program-wide rivalry first called the ''Commonwealth Challenge'' (2005\u20132007) which UVA swept 2\u20130 before ending the series in a show of sportsmanship following the [[Virginia Tech massacre]].

Under the ''Challenge'' rules, UVA would have won the 2016\u201317 competition outright on points, 12\u201310. Under the new ''Clash'' rules, the programs tied on points, 11\u201311, and VT won the tiebreaker.}}  rules, is also led by UVA (4\u20132, as of 2020). Moreover, the Cavaliers [[#All-time and ACC series results|lead the rivalry series]] in the majority of sports.\n\nBoth athletics programs are members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. In sports that have divisional play, such as [[college baseball]] and [[college football]], they both compete in the Coastal division of the conference. Despite different or no conference affiliations from 1937 to 2004, Virginia and Virginia Tech always maintained athletic ties and were annual rivals in a great many sports.\n\n==All-time and ACC series results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left\"\n|-\n!

Former [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and football analyst [[Kirk Herbstreit]] said in 2004 that he \"never realized how much those people hate each other.\" He went on to say \"when I was down in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], I said some nice things about [[Al Groh]] and it was like I had turned my back on them.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Tech-UVa relationship eye-opening for Herbstreit |newspaper= [[Roanoke Times]] |date= 2004-11-19 |url= http://www.roanoke.com/sports/notebookplus/wb/14125 |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, students from Virginia Tech put a [[tee shirt]] from their school on a statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]] located on [[The Lawn]], after Virginia Tech's football team won the yearly matchup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/16130903/virginia-tech-vandals-play-dress-up-with-tj|title=Virginia Tech Pranksters Play Dress-Up With Mr. Jefferson|website=www.nbc29.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Virginia Tech joins ACC===\nIn 2003, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] initially planned to add [[Boston College]], [[University of Miami|Miami]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] to the conference lineup. Talks with Syracuse stalled as [[Jim Boeheim]] vocalized his opposition to the move, and Duke, UNC, and Virginia consistently voted against adding the Orange. When it became obvious that Syracuse lacked the necessary seven votes, Virginia Tech emerged as a compromise candidate put forward to win over the decisive seventh vote from the University of Virginia that ACC officials needed to gain approval for their expansion plans.\n\nVirginia Governor [[Mark Warner]] earlier had suggested the NCAA intervene and mediate the expansion process, and when that failed added pressure to UVA President John Casteen to refrain from casting an affirmative vote for the conference's plan to expand without Virginia Tech.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/sports/colleges-obstacles-are-piling-up-in-acc-expansion-path.html Obstacles Piling Up in ACC Expansion Path], accessed March 6, 2016</ref> Warner feared that such a move would hurt Virginia Tech by leaving it in a diminished Big East.<ref>{{cite news |title= ACC to invite Virginia Tech |newspaper= The Washington Times |date= June 19, 2003 |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jun/19/20030619-010114-6618r/?page=all |accessdate= 2014-08-21 }}</ref> UVA President [[John T.

Miami and Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, with Boston College joining in 2005.\n\nThe primary significance of this development to the rivalry was that the athletic teams from the two schools would now be mandated to play every year. For instance, the men's [[college soccer]] teams did not face each other in any of the four seasons between 2000 and 2003. They have since met every year after Virginia Tech became a conference member in 2004. Additionally, in some sports where there was already an agreement to play each other on an annual basis, the teams might now play more than once. For instance, the men's [[college basketball]] teams had played each other annually since the 1934\u201335 season but not faced each other twice in the same season since 1983\u201384. Starting with the 2004\u201305 season, the teams have played at least twice each year, and in 2005\u201306 the teams met for a ''third'' time in the [[ACC Tournament]].\n\n===Impact of the Virginia Tech massacre===\nIn addition to ending the original ''[[#Commonwealth Challenge and Clash|Commonwealth Challenge]]'', the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] had the effect of lessening of hostilities between the two universities during the aftermath. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' \"students in both camps are more apt to think of themselves as simply Virginians.\" UVa students were among the first to lend support to the Virginia Tech community in the wake of the shootings. Likewise, the connections between the two university's populations are often very close. Prior to the 2007 football contest in Charlottesville both college's bands participated in a joint performance.<ref>{{cite news |title= After Tragedy, Hokies and Cavs Take Field as Virginians All |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date= 2007-11-23 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301215.html?nav=hcmodule |accessdate= 2007-12-02 |first= Jonathan |last= Mummolo}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...there was the sense among Tech students that fans of U-Va. \u2013 an institution founded by none other than [[Thomas Jefferson]] \u2013 looked down their noses at the mountain-ensconced Hokies of Blacksburg.

Former [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and football analyst [[Kirk Herbstreit]] said in 2004 that he \"never realized how much those people hate each other.\" He went on to say \"when I was down in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], I said some nice things about [[Al Groh]] and it was like I had turned my back on them.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Tech-UVa relationship eye-opening for Herbstreit |newspaper= [[Roanoke Times]] |date= 2004-11-19 |url= http://www.roanoke.com/sports/notebookplus/wb/14125 |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, students from Virginia Tech put a [[tee shirt]] from their school on a statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]] located on [[The Lawn]], after Virginia Tech's football team won the yearly matchup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/16130903/virginia-tech-vandals-play-dress-up-with-tj|title=Virginia Tech Pranksters Play Dress-Up With Mr. Jefferson|website=www.nbc29.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Virginia Tech joins ACC===\nIn 2003, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] initially planned to add [[Boston College]], [[University of Miami|Miami]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] to the conference lineup. Talks with Syracuse stalled as [[Jim Boeheim]] vocalized his opposition to the move, and Duke, UNC, and Virginia consistently voted against adding the Orange. When it became obvious that Syracuse lacked the necessary seven votes, Virginia Tech emerged as a compromise candidate put forward to win over the decisive seventh vote from the University of Virginia that ACC officials needed to gain approval for their expansion plans.\n\nVirginia Governor [[Mark Warner]] earlier had suggested the NCAA intervene and mediate the expansion process, and when that failed added pressure to UVA President John Casteen to refrain from casting an affirmative vote for the conference's plan to expand without Virginia Tech.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/sports/colleges-obstacles-are-piling-up-in-acc-expansion-path.html Obstacles Piling Up in ACC Expansion Path], accessed March 6, 2016</ref> Warner feared that such a move would hurt Virginia Tech by leaving it in a diminished Big East.<ref>{{cite news |title= ACC to invite Virginia Tech |newspaper= The Washington Times |date= June 19, 2003 |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jun/19/20030619-010114-6618r/?page=all |accessdate= 2014-08-21 }}</ref> UVA President [[John T.

Miami and Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, with Boston College joining in 2005.\n\nThe primary significance of this development to the rivalry was that the athletic teams from the two schools would now be mandated to play every year. For instance, the men's [[college soccer]] teams did not face each other in any of the four seasons between 2000 and 2003. They have since met every year after Virginia Tech became a conference member in 2004. Additionally, in some sports where there was already an agreement to play each other on an annual basis, the teams might now play more than once. For instance, the men's [[college basketball]] teams had played each other annually since the 1934\u201335 season but not faced each other twice in the same season since 1983\u201384. Starting with the 2004\u201305 season, the teams have played at least twice each year, and in 2005\u201306 the teams met for a ''third'' time in the [[ACC Tournament]].\n\n===Impact of the Virginia Tech massacre===\nIn addition to ending the original ''[[#Commonwealth Challenge and Clash|Commonwealth Challenge]]'', the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] had the effect of lessening of hostilities between the two universities during the aftermath. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' \"students in both camps are more apt to think of themselves as simply Virginians.\" UVa students were among the first to lend support to the Virginia Tech community in the wake of the shootings. Likewise, the connections between the two university's populations are often very close. Prior to the 2007 football contest in Charlottesville both college's bands participated in a joint performance.<ref>{{cite news |title= After Tragedy, Hokies and Cavs Take Field as Virginians All |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date= 2007-11-23 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301215.html?nav=hcmodule |accessdate= 2007-12-02 |first= Jonathan |last= Mummolo}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...there was the sense among Tech students that fans of U-Va. \u2013 an institution founded by none other than [[Thomas Jefferson]] \u2013 looked down their noses at the mountain-ensconced Hokies of Blacksburg.

A young man named Ryo and his tiger White Blaze mysteriously appears in the street, nearly causing a young boy named Ully to be injured while skateboarding. Mia and her grandfather believe that Ryo is one of the Ronin Warriors and that there is perhaps hope for the world. Mia rushes off to meet Ryo, but he is surrounded by police. Meanwhile, the storm clouds move in and all power cuts out, leaving cars stranded and causing a helicopter to crash. As glass shatters all over the city from a massive lightning strike, everyone but Ryo runs in fear and Ully gets separated from his parents.  Ryo calls out for the Dynasty to fight him and a Dynasty soldier shows up and the two battle. Ryo battles the soldier with the aid of White Blaze, which proves difficult, and Ully, who comes across the battle, is nearly killed before Mia saves him.  Ryo and White Blaze are defeated and Ryo is about to be killed when another Ronin Warrior, Rowen, protects him. The other Ronin Warriors, Cye, Sage and Kento also arrive to fight.  The Warriors summon their full armor and fight the soldier, but don't work as a team and are therefore unable to defeat him. He takes Ully and Mia hostage, trapping them in a television screen where they feel every injury he receives.  The soldier beats up Ryo until he calls up his ultimate attack, \"Flare Up Now\", destroying the soldier and accidentally blasting the building behind him in half. Mia and Ully are set free and the Dark Warlords and Talpa, the leaders of the Dynasty introduce themselves, sure in their victory over the Ronin Warriors, whom they see as weak, while a giant castle appears in the sky.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Glory for Anubis\n| TranslitTitle       = Onimash\u014d!

The military tries to launch an attack on Talpa's castle to no avail as the Dynasty turns their own weapons against them and obliterates the attacking force.  Anubis finds the Warriors, Mia and Ully hiding in the subway and attacks.  The Warriors use their armor to form the Circle of Power to protect Mia and Ully, but without their armors, they are no match for Anubis and he ties them up with his Quake With Fear attack.  The Ronins are unable to dissolve the circle and call upon their armors, but the Ancient One appears and uses his staff to dissolve it himself.  The Ronins summon their armor and Ryo and Anubis launch their most powerful attacks against each other at the same time.  One of Ryo's swords gets knocked from his hand and he passes out, but Anubis is injured too.  Realizing that the Circle of Power is unbroken and that he cannot allow the Ronins to face him, Talpa sends a tornado of dark energy that picks up the Warriors and scatters them to the most desolate regions on Earth.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Secret of Wildfire\n| TranslitTitle       = Yoroi Gia, Rekka no Himitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u93a7\u64ec\u4e9c\u3001\u70c8\u706b\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|14}}\n| AltDate             = June 28, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Mia and Ully find the sword Ryo dropped and are taken by White Blaze towards the volcano where Talpa dropped him.  Ryo awakens and starts climbing out while Talpa sends Anubis to destroy him for good.  Anubis and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers chase down Mia and Ully, believing that the two will lead them to Ryo, but they are saved by the Ancient One who uses his staff to open a giant chasm, taking out the Dynasty soldiers, though Anubis emerges unharmed.  The staff also restores power to the city and finding Mia's abandoned jeep working now, Mia and Ully head off again to find Ryo.  Ryo climbs out of the volcano, but is attacked by Anubis.  White Blaze returns his missing sword, but Anubis knocks him back into the volcano again.  However, Ryo's power is increased and he emerges as more than a match for Anubis.  Anubis captures Mia and Ully and Ryo is unable to approach them as his armor is hot enough to incinerate them.  Anubis casts them into the volcano to force Ryo to get rid of his armor to rescue them then prevents him from re-summoning it and beats him up and tosses him in the volcano again, but Ryo manages to pull Anubis in with him.  Both manage to get to safety in the volcano which starts to erupt.  Ryo calls upon his armor again and destroys Anubis' weapons as the volcano erupts and knocks Anubis into the eruption, but Anubis survives and is yelled at by Talpa for his failure.  Mia, Ully, Ryo and White Blaze vow to find the remaining Warriors who they believe are still alive and Ryo accepts that they need to work as a team to defeat the Dynasty.  This pleases the Ancient One who is watching from nearby.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The Search Begins\n| TranslitTitle       = Dokumash\u014d Naaza no Wana\n| NativeTitle         = \u6bd2\u9b54\u5c06 \u90a3\u5516\u632b\u306e\u7f60\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|21}}\n| AltDate             = June 29, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = With Anubis having failed, Talpa sends Sekhmet after the Ronin Warriors.  It is also shown that Talpa has captured the people of the city.  At the suggestion of Mia, she, Ryo, Ully and White Blaze head to the university where her grandfather works to get his help in finding the other Ronin Warriors.  On the way, the group stops by Ully's house to try to find his parents, but have no luck, so Ully vows he will help the Warriors defeat Talpa and save the world.  At the university, the group tries to enlist the help of Mia's grandfather, but he refuses to help, telling them to just give up.  Ully realizes that two suits of armor are two disguised Dynasty soldiers that attack.  Ryo, with help from White Blaze and Ully, defeats the soldiers, but Dr. Koji is possessed by a Dynasty spirit and attacks too.  Ryo manages to free Dr. Koji, but he has been poisoned by the Dynasty and dies, but not before revealing that the Warriors have been returned to the places where their armor was created.  Mia tries to find the answer in his computer while Sekhmet watches nearby, planning to follow them and attack once they find their comrades.  However, White Blaze detects the Dark Warlord and attacks him.  Ryo notices the fight and joins in, but is unable to defeat Sekhmet.  Finally Mia realizes that her grandfather was referring to a poem he used to teach her and finds it on the computer before the university is destroyed.  Ully notices that Sekhmet doesn't have six arms like it appears, he's just moving his arms really fast and informs Ryo who uses the information to defeat him.  Following the information found in the riddle, the group then heads to the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles with Sekhmet following them, unknown to them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Halo's Prison\n| TranslitTitle       = Fukkatsu!

Ryo battles a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and summons his armor to defeat them, while White Blaze takes out two enemy archers.  However, as Ryo heads underwater to find Cye, something goes wrong with his armor and Sekhmet attacks.  It turns out Ryo's armor is being affected by Sekhmet's poison amplified by the water and he is defeated.  Sekhmet heads to finish Cye off before he can awaken, but is attacked by fish and a whale.  He kills all of them, but it allows Ryo's swords to wake Cye.  Cye blasts Sekhmet and rescues Ryo before returning to the water to continue the battle.  As in the water Cye is immune to his poison, Sekhmet brings them to a bridge nearby and beats up Cye.  Ully and White Blaze revive Ryo by dragging him into a fire and he steps in to help Cye.  Combining Cye's Super Wave Smasher and Ryo's Flare Up Now, they defeat Sekhmet which Talpa is not pleased with.

After they are forced to abandon Mia's jeep, Sage heads off on his own and orders Mia to return to the city, but she refuses and follows him.  A snowstorm starts and Mia is attacked by a pack of wild wolves, but is saved by Sage.  Cale tries to take them out with an avalanche, but they jump out of the way and the wolves are swept away by the avalanche.  Knowing it is too dangerous for Mia to leave if Talpa or his Warlords caused that, Sage allows Mia to come with him and they head to a giant rock called The Throne of the Gods.  Mia believes that this is what the line of the poem \"burning within a throne of rock\" meant when it referred to Kento's location.  Cale attacks the two and Sage tries to break the rock with his Thunder Bolt Cut, but does no damage to it.  Cale thrusts his sword into the rock and it will seek out Kento's heart and kill him before he wakes.  Sage and Cale battle, but Sage is unable to defeat him and he and Mia fall over a cliff next a waterfall.  The two fall into a cave and as they lay unconscious, the Ancient One appears and tells Sage that he needs to unlock the full power of his armor by achieving concentration of both mind and body then disappears before Sage wakes up.  Mia decides to distract Cale while Sage rescues Kento and upon reaching a cliff-top, calls Cale out.  He doesn't appear, but she notices the Ancient One and remembers how he dissolved the Circle of Power and gave the Ronins back their armor and saved her and Sage from drowning and wonders why he just doesn't save Kento himself.  As he walks away, Mia calls after him and follows, but he disappears as the snow starts up again.  Cale catches her and dangles her in a waterfall to draw the meditating Sage out.  When that fails, he freezes the waterfall, but Sage emerges and saves Mia.  With his full power unlocked, it restores life to the land and he successfully uses the Thunder Bolt Cut on the rock as the sword reaches Kento.  At first it appears as if Sage acted too late, but Kento bursts out of the rock and causes an explosion that blows Cale away.  With Kento rescued, the three head back to the city to reunite with the others and find Rowen.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Friend or Foe\n| TranslitTitle       = Genmash\u014d, Rajura no Sakuryaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u5e7b\u9b54\u5c06\u3001\u87ba\u546a\u7f85\u306e\u7b56\u7565\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|6|25}}\n| AltDate             = July 5, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa sends Dais to destroy the Ronin Warriors before they can locate and rescue Rowen.  As they drive back to the city, Mia explains the poem to Sage and Kento, explaining that the last verse that will lead them to Rowen is \"floating amongst the eyes of the ages, unmoored in the stream of the sky,\" but she has no idea what this means.  At a temple, Ryo, Cye, Ully and White Blaze wait for the others, but Ully is captured by Dais.  Ryo and Cye battle him to save Ully and manage to free Ully, but he nearly falls to his death before White Blaze saves him.  Dais easily defeats Ryo and Cye and then claims that he holds Rowen captive and tells them to meet him in the city of Sandai to rescue him.  Ryo and Cye head off to find Rowen, leaving Ully and White Blaze behind to let the others know what happened.  At Sandai, Ryo and Cye find Rowen held captive by Dynasty soldiers.  The two armor up and destroy the soldiers and it is revealed that \"Rowen\" is actually an illusion and that it is really Dais.  Dais creates an illusion so that Ryo and Cye each believe that they are fighting Dais, but are really fighting each other.  The two use their ultimate attacks on each other, and knock each other out, realizing the truth just after they attack.  Dais prepares to finish them, but the others arrive and he decides to do the same to Sage and Kento.  Sage sees through the illusion and drops his weapon, but Kento doesn't and beats Sage up.  After the truth is revealed, Kento turns on Dais and uses his Iron Rock Crusher to drive him off.  While the group recovers from their wounds, Ryo sees a shooting star and realizes that \"unmoored in the stream of the sky\" means that Rowen is floating in outer space and Mia believes that he's right.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Wildfire in the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Rekka, Tenk\u016b o Sukue\n| NativeTitle         = \u70c8\u706b\u3001\u5929\u7a7a\u3092\u3059\u304f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|2}}\n| AltDate             = July 6, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Now that they know where Rowen is, the Warriors try to figure out how to get to him.  Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Talpa will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be.  Mia proposes that two of the Warriors find out Talpa's plan while the other two return to the city.  When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Mia chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Ully to tell Mia when she wakes up.  Talpa summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a massive supernatural construct called a Dark Matrix that will be able to destroy anything it's sent against.  Talpa plans to send it to destroy Rowen.  As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the Dark Matrix is, Talpa sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them.  Though they easily defeat them, the Dark Matrix is launched, but the Ancient One intervenes and destroys it.  Talpa calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento.  The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building.  However, the energy from the Dark Matrix strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death.  The Dark Matrix starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the matrix.  Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the Dark Matrix launches into space.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = In the Sea of the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u016bketsu!

Talpa appears to the others and taunts them about the fact that Ryo and Rowen will soon be dead and sends his soldiers to face them.  Anubis asks for a fair fight against Ryo, claiming it won't be victory if the Warriors aren't defeated in a fair fight, but Talpa refuses to listen to him and plans to use the power of the Nether Realm to destroy the Warriors and sends Anubis away.  Inside the Dark Matrix, as Ryo is slowly crushed, he realizes that if he doesn't do something both he and Rowen will die.  Channeling the energy his armor is absorbing, Ryo launches Flare Up Now and destroys the Dark Matrix from within.  Seeing this from the ground, the other Warriors despair, but continue fighting.  Ryo survives the explosion, but passes out and starts to drift out into space.  However, Rowen wakes up and uses his bow to reel Ryo in.  Rowen propels them back to Earth which the other Warriors witness and rejoice.  Anubis senses it too and heads out to stop Ryo and Rowen while Talpa realizes that another power has awakened inside of Anubis.  Rowen doesn't remember what happened and before Ryo can explain, they are attacked by Anubis.  Ryo is injured and weakened from the energy ball and fails when he tries Flare Up Now on Anubis who captures him and Rowen with Quake With Fear.  However, Anubis hesitates to kill the helpless Ryo with his desire for a fair fight conflicting with his Dynasty morals.  Before he can decide, Rowen hits him with Arrow Shockwave.  Anubis survives the attack, but his mask and helmet breaks in half, revealing to a shocked Rowen that he's human.  Anubis tries to attack Rowen again, but is stopped by Talpa himself as his loyalty seems to be faltering.  Talpa teleports Anubis back to his castle.  The other Warriors, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and the Ronin Warriors are finally reunited.  Seeing that he has failed to stop the Warriors reunion, Talpa orders his castle gates sealed against the inevitable attack.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Assault on the Dynasty\n| TranslitTitle       = Y\u014djamon o Uchiyabure\n| NativeTitle         = \u5996\u90aa\u9580\u3092\u6253\u3061\u7834\u308c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|16}}\n| AltDate             = July 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa has his castle gates closed and the defenses activated.  A bank of think fog rolls over Toyama and Mia reveals that it is part of the castle's defenses.  The group walks along and comes to a bank of thick black fog that's another part of the defenses and Kento tries to enter with a vehicle, but is attacked by streams of energy and driven out.  The energy attacks the rest of the group, but they manage to escape.  In the castle, Talpa summons Dais to deal with the Warriors and he convinces Talpa to open the gates and let the Warriors in so he can draw them into a trap, explaining that their armor will be easier to control inside the castle with the hep of the Nether Spirits.  Talpa agrees, but warns Dais that he will be very angry if Dais fails to stop the Warriors.  The fog is lifted and the group is able to see the four gates to Talpa's castle, but decide to leave Mia and Ully behind as it is too dangerous.  Ryo refuses to listen to Ully's pleas to let him come and slaps him, causing Ully to run off.  Mia follows him and Ryo sends White Blaze after them to protect them while he and the other Warriors enter the gates, closing them behind them.  Dais arrives and opens the gates, summoning the Nether Spirits.  Unable to defeat Dais, the Warriors try to summon their armor, but the spirits block their powers and Dais easily defeats them.  Mia finds Ully who knows Ryo never meant to hurt him and convinces her that they need to help the Warriors.  They notice their friends in trouble and start to go to help them, but the spirits attack them, but the Ancient One's staff appears and drives them away.  Dais ties up the Warriors and offers Ryo his life in exchange for serving Talpa, but Ryo refuses so Dais cuts him down to kill him.  Before he can, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and Dais tries to attack them, but the Ancient One's staff protects them and drives away the spirits.  With the spirits gone, Ryo is able to summon his armor and blasts Dais away with Flare Up Now.  The attack also destroys the castle gates.  Talpa promises that Ryo will fall and won't be able to defeat him.  Ryo apologizes to Ully and thanks him and Mia for saving him.

He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan.  In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy.  Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again.  Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the celing, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field.  There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Talpa speaks to him.  Talpa reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin.  He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conquer and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust.  Talpa believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conquer everything.  The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but it is revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions.  He and Talpa try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn.  Dais and Talpa claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thirsty of the group and thus he will be the first to turn.  Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill.  Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat.  After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher.  The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position.  Talpa speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side.  Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen.  Talpa congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part.  Dais doesn't believe Anubis worthy, but Talpa assures him that Anubis has changed.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Armor of Life\n| TranslitTitle       = Shuten, Kokoro Naki Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30f3\u3001\u5fc3\u306a\u304d\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|6}}\n| AltDate             = July 13, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = As Anubis showed weakness when he battled Ryo and Rowen last, Talpa has the Nether Spirits fortify the evil in his heart.  Anubis protests at first, but after the spirits powers take effect, he breaks free of his binds and is sent by Talpa to enact the next phase of his plan.  At an amusement park, while Ully heads off with White Blaze to play, Dynasty soldiers attack.  Sage battles them and is nearly beaten, but is saved by Ryo and Cye.  Together they defeat the Dynasty soldiers in the park and in a subway and decide that following the subway might lead them to Talpa's castle.  Rowen and Kento arrive having followed the sounds of battle, but Kento displays doubts about his future when they refer to the soldiers as \"Dynasty twerps\" wondering if he'll become a \"Dynasty twerp\" too when his armor turns him evil.  Anubis arrives, his eyes glowing red occasionally and proves to be more powerful than ever.  The Warriors except for Kento armor up, with Kento's own doubts combined with Anubis being human increasing his fear of what he could become.  At the insistence of the others, Kento tries to power up, but fails due to his fears about his armor.  Kento explains what happened to the others and his fears that if he uses the armor he will become like the Dark Warlords.  As a result, Kento refuses to fight with his armor and without it, the other Warriors are weakened and no match for Anubis.  Talpa is pleased as without Kento the Warriors will be easy for Anubis, who the Nether Spirits are keeping in control, to defeat.  Anubis proves too powerful for the Warriors and defeats them with his Quake With Fear.  The Ancient One appears nearby and tells the Warriors to trust their armor, that it responds to what's in their hearts.  Anubis goes to finish Ryo, but Ully and White Blaze try to stop him.  Anubis easily throws them aside, injuring them, but Ully's courage causes Kento to summon his armor, saying that Ully taught him what real courage is.  Anubis tries to attack again with Quake With Fear, but Kento hits him with Iron Rock Crusher.  Not only does Kento's attack knock Anubis out, but it drives the spirits influence from his body.  However, it leaves the Warriors wondering what does it mean for them that a human is wearing evil armor.  Talpa tries to pull Anubis back to his castle, but the Ancient One intervenes and pulls Anubis to him instead.  Talpa is furious while the Warriors realize that the Ancient One has arrived to help them which he confirms.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = The Ancient's Battle\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaosu, Shukumei no Taiketsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u3001\u5bbf\u547d\u306e\u5bfe\u6c7a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|13}}\n| AltDate             = July 14, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, Ully and Mia meet with the Ancient One in a park. The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Raid on Talpa's Castle\n| TranslitTitle       = Totsuny\u016b, Arago-j\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a81\u5165\u3001\u30a2\u30e9\u30b4\u57ce\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|20}}\n| AltDate             = July 17, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, leaving behind Mia, Ully and White Blaze who wish them good luck, enter the Ancient One's bridge. Talpa sends the Nether Spirits to destroy the bridge and the Warriors and collect their armor and they nearly succeed, but the spirit of the Ancient One is able to channel the bridge's energy and destroy the spirits. Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Talpa then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyways. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Talpa and the two meet up and finally confront Talpa face to face and demand answers. Talpa explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Talpa to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle. Meanwhile, as the other Ronin fight their opponents, Anubis, still trapped in the castle dungeon, tells them to hold on as he will help them thanks to the Ancient One freeing him from Talpa's evil.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = The Legend of the Armor\n| TranslitTitle       = Akasareta Yoroi Densetsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u660e\u304b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u93a7\u4f1d\u8aac\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|27}}\n| AltDate             = July 18, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo falls to a ledge and is nearly killed by Sekhmet but is saved by Cye. Ryo climbs to the top of the castle and faces Talpa again inside, but is again easily defeated and thrown back outside. Meanwhile, Mia and Ully become determined to help the Ronin Warriors and ride White Blaze through the bridge to the castle where they dodge Dynasty attacks. Talpa watches as the Warriors fight with some success against the Warlords and realizes that their armor grows stronger the more they battle and he needs that for himself. When the Warriors manage to get past the Warlords, Talpa calls them off and demands the Warlords give their armor to him. They agree and Talpa absorbs the Warlords and starts building a physical body for himself. Mia, Ully and White Blaze find Ryo in a lot of pain and come under attack by a Dynasty army but are saved by Rowen and Cye and Rowen destroys most of the army with Arrow Shockwave. The Ronins then destroy much of the rest and form an energy pyramid that destroys the rest. Talpa reveals that the source of the armor is that it originally belonged to him before the Ancient One stole it and tried to hide it from him and attacks with his hand, injuring Ryo and causing his armor to disappear and absorbing Rowen, Cye and Kento. Meanwhile, Anubis escapes from his prison to help. Mia and Ully are captured by more Dynasty soldiers while White Blaze is surrounded, but Anubis saves them. His presence causes the remaining Ronin virtues to activate and Ryo is healed. Sage attacks Talpa to no avail and his sword is destroyed and he is absorbed.

This causes Mia to lose hope, but not Ully. Ryo attacks Talpa to no avail with not even Flare Up Now doing anything. Talpa grabs Ryo and explains that having absorbed eight armors he is too powerful for Ryo to harm. However, before he can harm or absorb Ryo, the other Warriors, who are still alive inside Talpa, fight back and manage to force Talpa to let Ryo go. Ryo becomes determined to find someway to free his friends and kill Talpa, but is unsure how while Talpa grows stronger by feeding off the fear of the people he has captured which gives Mia and Ully hope as that means that Ully's parents and the other people Talpa has captured are still alive. Talpa chases Ryo who is reluctant to destroy him as doing so will kill the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo is nearly absorbed by Talpa, but White Blaze saves him and they fight Talpa who forces the other Ronin Warriors to use their attacks against Ryo.

However, the spirit of the Ancient One appears to him to show him how Talpa tried to take over the world in the past. The Ancient One shows Ryo how he defeated Talpa and killed him, but Talpa swore that with his armor he would return one day and returned to the Nether World as a soul. The Ancient One, knowing that with Talpa's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Talpa's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to the Ancient One, not necessarily to Talpa's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Talpa's side. The Ancient One explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after the Ancient One explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Talpa who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below. Inside Talpa, Ryo watches as the spirit of the Ancient One apologizes to the Warriors for involving them in the battle against Talpa who appears and tries to make Ryo despair by claiming his friends now hate and feel betrayed by him. Ryo refuses to give into despair and calls upon his friends to help him fight once more. Ryo emerges from Talpa and absorbs the power of the other four armors to form a new armor, the Inferno Armor. With the Inferno, Ryo is more than a match for Talpa and blasts him with Flare Up Now, destroying him and his castle and releasing the other Ronin Warriors. The Warriors float safely to the ground while Mia, Ully and White Blaze escape through the Ancient One's bridge and the group stands on a rooftop and looks out at the now freed city, the threat over.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 20\n| Title               = Ronin vs. Saranbo\n| TranslitTitle       = Arata naru Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|9|24}}\n| AltDate             = July 21, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo is attacked and killed by Talpa, but is relieved when he wakes up and realizes that it was just a nightmare.

At the gates to the Nether World, a new threat, Saranbo appears, announcing his intention to destroy the world and steal the Ronin armors for himself to become invincible. Ryo finds Mia researching his armor and she explains that her grandfather was aware of the armors special powers and that the white armor he had summoned is called the Inferno armor. However, she is worried about Ryo as it takes a lot out of him to use and she believes he should rest. Ryo feels fine after sleeping a lot and believes he is okay now. After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo. Ryo loses until the Inferno Armor forms around him and he blasts Saranbo with Flare Up Now, apparently destroying him.

Mia explains that the swords couldn't handle the intensity of the Inferno armor and continuing to use it as Ryo did could result in it failing him. Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Ully suggests finding him a new one, causing Mia to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for. Mia finds a special pair of swords meant for the original wearer of the Inferno armor called the Soul Swords of Fervor or the Soul Swords which legend states is hidden at the base of a volcano and protected by a special divine power.

A gateway to the Nether Realm appears and Sun Devil's master speaks to the Ronins through it, revealing himself to be the still-alive Talpa who is determined to have the Ronin armor return to him.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 25\n| Title               = Torrent's Evil Twin\n| TranslitTitle       = Taiketsu!

He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent. However, a wave of poison emerges from Red Torrent's remains and Cye's attempt to stop it fails and he is overwhelmed by the attack and passes out. Sekhmet reveals himself and captures Cye, taking him through a gate to the Nether World.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 26\n| Title               = The Armor Must Be Destroyed\n| TranslitTitle       = K\u014drin yo, Hikari o Torimodose\n| NativeTitle         = \u5149\u8f2a\u3088\u3001\u5149\u3092\u3068\u308a\u3082\u3069\u305b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|19}}\n| AltDate             = July 31, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ancient One's spirit tells Sage to rely on mind, skill and spirit and not just the strength of his armor to overcome evil, saying that harnessing those three things will allow him to attain an even greater strength. In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil.  This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Talpa opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 27\n| Title               = Sand Blasted\n| TranslitTitle       = Ikare Kong\u014d, Suna Y\u014dja o Kudake\n| NativeTitle         = \u6012\u308c\u91d1\u525b\u3001\u7802\u5996\u90aa\u3092\u304f\u3060\u3051\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|26}}\n| AltDate             = August 1, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Having already captured Cye and Sage, Talpa decides to send Dais to capture another Ronin and Dais picks Kento. Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Talpa agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Talpa of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what the Ancient One told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are. Using this, Kento unleashes Iron Rock Crusher again and destroys the Sand Strikers. Kento finally understands that in order to use all of his armor's strength, he must focus all of its power. Dais shows up again and attacks, but after he reveals that Cye and Sage have been captured, Kento willingly follows him to the Nether Realm in an effort to rescue them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 28\n| Title               = Lady Kayura and the Dark Realm\n| TranslitTitle       = Nazo no Onna Y\u014dja Kayura Shutsugen\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b0e\u306e\u5973\u5996\u90aa\u30ab\u30e6\u30e9\u51fa\u73fe\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|12|3}}\n| AltDate             = August 2, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Rowen practices his now-maximized powers by using Arrow Shockwave to successfully blast away storm clouds, but is blasted by an unseen force and pulled into the clouds where he is confronted by a beautiful girl named Lady Kayura.

The Ancient One proves to be skilled and dodges or counters all of her attacks to Lady Kayura's surprise. She tries blasting the Ancient One, but he absorbs her attack and disappears, causing her to realize that she needs to report the troubling development of the Ancient One's return to Talpa. The Ancient One travels to a waterfall where it is revealed that he's not actually the Ancient One but someone who has taken on his role and his way of doing things. Ryo is determined to get into the Nether Realm and rescue his friends and despite Mia and Rowen's warnings that it is a trap, he is insistent so Rowen decides to join him in trying.

Anubis convinces them of his sincerity and accepting him as a friend, they invite him to stay with them. Anubis explains to them how four hundred years ago he was a warrior that had become extremely power-hungry and bloodthirsty which caused him to join Talpa, but the Ancient One showed him that that wasn't a good thing and that Talpa wasn't his destiny as he thought. He now realizes that his destiny is to stop Talpa. Anubis senses the presence of Dais and forces him to show himself. Dais claims that all of the Ronin Warriors have been captured by Talpa, but Anubis points out that Ryo and Rowen are still free. Dais explains that they are merely being toyed with by Talpa and attacks Anubis who easily defeats him, knocking his helmet off and revealing his face to Ully and Mia. Anubis refuses to kill him, saying that Dais' armor protects him and tries to convince Dais that the armor's power doesn't come from Talpa like he believes but that Talpa wants it for himself before he, Ully and Mia leave. In the Nether World Ryo meets up with Rowen and White Blaze and a gate appears in front of them which they travel through. There they are met by a Nether Spirit who claims that Cye, Sage and Kento are merely guests of Talpa and asks them to join them, but to give up their armor first. However, they know that the spirit is lying and refuse and the spirit leaves and Talpa's castle appears nearby. Talpa visits the captured Warriors who are being drained by Nether Spirits and has the spirits drain a bunch of their power at once and give it to him, allowing him to create a sword from the power of their armor to defeat Ryo and Rowen with. Talpa then sends Lady Kayura to give the sword to a Dynasty warlord named Dala to use against Ryo and Rowen and capture them. However, upon returning to her room where she is visited by Talpa, Lady Kayura shows doubts about if what she is doing is right.

Dala reveals the origin of his sword to their shock. Meanwhile, the Dark Warlords worry about being confronted by Ryo and Rowen with the power of the Inferno Armor and beg Talpa to destroy them and end it. Talpa summons Badamon, Lord of the Nether Spirits to explain the story behind the Inferno. Badamon explains that it came to be when the world was plagued by evil a long time ago. The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conquer the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor.

As he would be under the influence of the evil armors, he would then do what they want. Talpa agrees, but tells Badamon not to tell the Dark Warlords which he agrees with as they may change sides if they realize they are being used. Badamon asks for Lady Kayura's help and gives her a magic dust that will allow her to control Ryo. Ryo and Rowen try to make their way to Talpa's castle undetected, but are found and blocked in and the Dark Warlords and some Dynasty soldiers are sent to confront them. They defeat the soldiers and escape, but are confronted by Lady Kayrua who uses the dust on the Warlords, Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze and forces Ryo to summon the Inferno using the power of Rowen and the Dark Warlords armors with the Nether Spirits and the dust to control him. However, instead of the Inferno being controlled by the Dark Warlords armors, it works in reverse, controlling them and making them attack Lady Kayura. However, they are no match for her and she easily defeats them. She wakes Ryo, but he drives the Nether Spirits and dust's influence from his body and battles Lady Kayura.

Ryo, exhausted and in pain from the battle and Rowen rest and discuss how Ryo didn't feel any different after absorbing the power of the Dark Warlords. This leads Rowen to theorize that perhaps they aren't all bad as they protected Ryo briefly from Lady Kayura. While Lady Kayura lost against Ryo, Talpa is still pleased with her as the Armor of Inferno was proven to have the power to destroy the mortal world like Talpa wants. Ully, Mia and Anubis look through Mia's grandfather's data, looking for anything they can use against the Dynasty and Anubis spots a symbol that Talpa uses and becomes determined to find out what it is as it may be important. Mia discovers that the symbol stands for the Jewel of Life, an object capable of destroying Talpa which was hidden by the very first Ancients. After the discovery, Anubis senses something and when investigating, comes under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Anubis fights them and they alert Badamon of Mia's discovery. Badamon orders the soldiers not to let Mia, Ully and Anubis escape with the information and two soldiers lure Anubis away while another tries to kill Mia and Ully. Anubis defeats the soldiers and Mia locates the a map leading to the Jewel of Life which Anubis realizes is near water. Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen contemplate how the Dark Warlords almost seemed to turn good and worry about their friends. Needing to stop Anubis, Mia and Ully from finding the Jewel, Badamon dispatches a Dynasty warrior named Gash to stop them, explaining that legend says that the Jewel is the heart of the nine armors and beats strong in the heart of the pure and gives strength to the weak and thus is a threat to Talpa and his empire. Mia uncovers the same thing, reading that the Jewel gives the armors their power and figuring out with Anubis that it must be in Jewel Lake. The three head there with Anubis planning to travel to the Nether World afterwards to help the Ronin Warriors, but refusing to allow Ully and Mia to come as it is too dangerous. At Jewel Lake, Anubis parts the water with the Ancient One's staff and is able to use the staff to open the tomb that's revealed at the bottom. In the tomb they find the armors of the Ancients that guard the tomb, murals of the battles between Hariel and evil in the past and the Jewel of Life. When Ully picks up the Jewel, the Ancient One speaks to them telling them that only the pure of heart can use the Jewel as in evil hands it could destroy the world. Gash arrives with Dynasty soldiers and attacks, but the Ancient armors, possessed by the souls of their wearers, destroy the soldiers and when Gash threatens Mia and Ully, Anubis stabs him through the back with the Ancient One's staff, killing him. At the Ancient One's request, Anubis releases the souls in the armors to move on, their job now finished and puts the Jewel around Mia's neck when Ully gives it to him, saying that Ully and Mia are the purest of heart people he knows and they will all go together to save their friends.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| Title               = Strata's Defiant Stand\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenk\u016b, Kizudarake no Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7a7a\u3001\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306e\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|1|28}}\n| AltDate             = August 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis, Mia and Ully contemplate the power of the Jewel of Life and wonder how it is supposed to defeat Talpa and Mia gives it to Ully to wear.

Badamon approaches Talpa with fears about allowing Ryo and Rowen free rein within the castle before a structure the Nether Spirits are building which Badamon calls the Tower of Pain is completed due to the unfathomable power of the Inferno Armor, but Talpa assures him that they won't be free for long as he is drawing them into a trap.

Ryo and Rowen continue to make their way through the maze, avoiding Dynasty soldiers and trying to find a way into the castle.

The two fight her to no avail and she tricks Ryo into launching Flare Up Now at her then dodges, causing him to hit a structure which drains his armor of power. Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Talpa's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others.

Realizing they need the other Ronin Warriors to win, Rowen sacrifices himself to buy them some more time by blasting Lady Kayura into the air and trying to fight her there, but is instead defeated and apparently killed. Ryo prepares to continue the battle with Lady Kayura, but Anubis interrupts and tells Ryo to let him handle it while Ryo goes off to rescue the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Mia and Ully, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Mia and Ully uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Talpa isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with the Ancient One's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where it is revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues. Rowen uses the strength of his armor's power of Life in the form of his arrows to try to awaken the others before collapsing. Ryo arrives near the other Warriors and is confronted by the Dark Warlords and defeated, however, Ully, Mia and White Blaze arrive and when Ully rushes forward to help, the Jewel protects Ryo and harms the Dark Warlords, driving them off. However, Lady Kayura arrives and like the Staff of the Ancients, the Jewel has no effect on her. As it looks like it is over for Ryo, Rowen and the other Ronin Warriors appear to once again help Ryo fight the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Cheap Tricks\n| TranslitTitle       = Kessen!

However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Ully and Mia at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when the Ancient One's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Mia and Ully, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together. They reach Cye in time for Anubis to restore light to the area with the staff which also drives off Cale. The group quickly reunites with the others and Ryo forms the Inferno. With the Inferno, Ryo is able to block Lady Kayura's Star Sword Scream and blasts her with Rage of Inferno, breaking her amulet off her neck. Lady Kayura is left completely confused at where she is and when Ryo goes to finish her off, Anubis stops him, explaining that for some reason the staff wouldn't let him harm her. The Jewel of Life also glows and Badamon and Talpa grow worried as the Ronin Warriors now control the artifact.

When they leave, Mia and Ully stay behind and Anubis decides to as well as he isn't sure of what the Ancient One's will for him now is. Mia, Ully and White Blaze for Warriors in Good Job. The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Talpa. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of the Ancient One's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Talpa as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of the Ancient One's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Talpa sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords. Badamon goes to Lady Kayura and successfully possesses her to do the Dynasty will while Anubis senses that something has happened to her and realizing that she is the last of the Ancient One's clan, becomes determined to save her like the Ancient One saved him. The Dark Warlords attack and Anubis is forced to fight them briefly until he uses the Ancient One's staff to split the land and send them away. As the Warriors defeat the Dynasty soldiers, Lady Kayura arrives atop a Dynasty Dark Matrix and Sage and Cye's attacks have absolutely no effect against it so they form the Inferno Armor. However, the Inferno has no effect against the Matrix either and it crashes into Ryo and detonates, dispelling the Inferno and knocking the Ronin Warriors out, except for Ryo.

Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Mia confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this. Lady Kayura sends the Warlords up to more barges and battles Anubis whose Quake With Fear has little effect on her. Lady Kayura defeats Anubis and captures him too then goes after Ully and the Jewel of Life. Talpa cheers his victory in capturing the nine armors and how he will use them to complete his plan. Lady Kayura chases Ully, Mia and White Blaze nearly getting the Jewel of Life before White Blaze retrieves it from her.

Badamon and the Nether Spirits, rejoicing in this, fly through the gateway to the mortal world. Ryo tries Flare Up Now on Talpa, but he just jumps in the river and puts out the flames and climbs a tower. Lady Kayura warns Ryo to be careful as the tower is filled with the essence of pain and is behind the Dynasty's evil power and it could turn Ryo evil like she once was. Talpa transports the tower and himself into the mortal world where its influence brings out the worst in humanity and makes people turn on each other. Everyone travels back to the mortal world to continue the fight and the Ronin Warriors combine their armors upon Ryo once more to form the Inferno Armor and he unleashes a column of flame that destroys Badamon.

Ryo refuses to fight and is then savagely beaten by Mukala. Sage saves Ryo from a fatal blow and resolves to keep fighting, but he too realizes that they have become pawns in a battle between the two Inferno Armors. He decides to stop fighting as well. Cye, still separated from the group and questioning his will to fight, is found by White Blaze. Kento, Rowen, Mia and Ully travel to Nairobi, Tanzania to find Ryo and Sage. They decide to decipher the conflict between the two armors rather leaving it as a contest of strength. As they attempt to locate the Taulagi village, they are attacked by the tribe. Kento and Ully become separated from Rowen and Mia, but spot Naria and follow her to Ryo and Sage's location. Rowen and Mia discover engravings in a cave, which speaks of The Tree of Life, whose evil light will inspire the people and save them from all that threaten their lives. The Tree of Life forms the entrance to their valley, while all is underneath the Black Inferno Armor. Kento attempts to rescue Ryo and Sage but is intercepted by Mukala. Kento's armor then flashes a darker color as he attempts to battle Mukala, which Ully notices as appearing more evil. Mia reads on the cave walls that if the Black and White Inferno Armors, which were both born in the valley, were to ever meet, that it would release an energy that would be too much for the universe to bear. Rowen's armor unlocks a power within the crystals around them which causes the lightning to strike The Tree of Life. More dark crystals arise, which Mukala uses to don the Black Inferno Armor. Rowen then arrives and tells Kento to stop fighting, telling them that another person's will is manipulating all of them into a dishonest fight. Naria tells Mukala that the armor has been influencing him negatively. Kento and Rowen attempt to attack Mukala, but both notice that it is their armor's will that is forcing them to fight rather than their own.

Cye soon finds the group and uses his virtue to restore Ryo, Sage, Rowen, and Kento back to health. They notice the virtue has disappeared from his armor, noticing it must be removing themselves during this conflict. Naria explains the history of the armor and their tribe: the Black Inferno Armor appeared in the Valley of the Black Crystal, and that the Talaugi were worshiped because of this. The Black Inferno Armor was always worn by their tribe and protected them from outside influence, but one day it showed that it could move on its own power and revealed a darker side. When Mukala discovered there was another Inferno Armor, the Black Inferno Armor ordered that it find and fight it, to which Mukala obeyed. Naria is dismayed that Mukala has become overpowered by the Black Inferno Armor. Black Blaze soon separates himself from White Blaze, which then separates Cye from the Armor of Torrent, which moves on its own accord. The Ronin Warriors then decide to destroy both Inferno Armors, saying that the armors without virtue become sinister forces. Naria pleads with Mukala to end the conflict, but to no avail. White Blaze is soon attacked by the tribe, which then capture Mia, Ully and Naria. Black Blaze gives the Armor of Torrent to Mukala, who summons the other armors to create the Inferno Armor. The Ronin Warriors soon find Mukala, and though he attacks them, they state that they do not wish to fight them but rather want to confront the Inferno Armor. The two Inferno Armors manipulate the sun and moon, which creates an lunar eclipse that darkens the land. The Ronin Warriors see visions of the end of the world that would result from the two armors' lust for battle. They resolve to let their virtues win, and summon their own armor to battle The Inferno Armor, which is now acting on its own will. Despite being initially unable to cause any damage, the five decide to fight with their spirits as one, attacking The Inferno Armor with the power of their virtues. This defeats the evil spirit residing within, and Ryo is able to don The Inferno Armor once again. Ryo then commences battle with Mukala, who has donned the Black Inferno armor. Ryo again pleads with Mukala to end the battle, saying that an armor that has abandoned its spirit can only bring death. While the two continue to fight, their attacks bring shockwaves onto the landscape; Naria and White Blaze are soon caught in the crossfire and are dealt fatal blows. Mukala, mortified, surveys the damage; the Ronin Warriors use the opportunity attack him with their virtues to let him see the true nature of the human spirit. The attack succeeds. The eclipse soon clears, and the armors then disappear, but not before reviving Naria and White Blaze. Mukala then approaches Naria and warmly calls her by her name, as Ryo, Rowen, Sage, Cye, Kento, Mia and Ully look on.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n|}\n\n===Ronin Warriors: Message===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #aaa;\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

He is unsure who is calling upon them, as he feels his days of fighting should be behind him. A mysterious being known as Suzunagi soon covers the city with light beams, and attacks Rowen. Though Rowen is able to deflect her attacks, this confirms Suzunagi's suspicions that though they are no longer Ronin Warriors, they still have enhanced abilities. She tells Rowen that they will continue to be Ronin Warriors until they die, that she feels sorry for them and that they should curse the Ancient One for giving them their armors in the first place. A flashback shows the origins of the Armor of Strata: The Ancient One uncovers a box containing it, being relieved that it has not found its true master. He says that due to the impending evil that it is time to be called upon again. As he unlocks the Armor of Strata, he is met but a young Suzunagi, imploring him not to release the armor as it would ignite the fires of war. The Ancient One notices the girl is filled with bitterness of the past, and commands the Armor of Strata to release her from her anger. The young Suzunagi is able to evade the attack. In the present day, Rowen tells Suzunagi to relieve her hatred against the armors, and resolves to find the source behind her anger in order to put her at peace. Rowen uncovers Suzunagi's drawings of the armors, but notices that they are of different designs. He is then given a vision of Suzunagi proclaiming a hatred of the armors, as well as an attempt destroy them. Suzunagi tells Rowen that the sadness she felt as a child has evolved into hatred, and orders Rowen to kill her. Rowen refuses to harm her until he discovers why she hates the armors. Suzunagi then states that Rowen will be judged, and summons the Armor of Strata on Rowen's behalf. The episode ends with Rowen sitting in a new Armor of Strata, but he is immobile.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Predestined Future\n| TranslitTitle       = Shirasareta Mirai\n| NativeTitle         = \u77e5\u3089\u3055\u308c\u305f\u672a\u6765\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1991|5|22}}\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = As Suzunagi looks upon the immobile Rowen, she mentions that he is the \"first.\" Cye receives a dream of the armors as well as a distressed Rowen, who calls for help. Ryo, Sage, Cye and Kento reunite, and all mention that they had the same dream. Ryo opens a package from Rowen, which consist of a book of the Edo period called \"The Legend of the Five Armors.\" It is a stage play about the Ronin Warriors and their battle against Talpa, but this was written back in the 19th Century before it became true. Rowen's package contains a letter stating that though the five have not seen each other since the armors disappeared, he believes they are being called again and will investigate. Ryo expresses disbelief that the play contains all of their battles, feeling as though they are puppets on a cardboard stage. Cye laments the idea that they are being drawn into battle again, wondering if this will define his life. He soon receives visions of avatars of samurai warriors attacking the city, but also of himself, wearing in the Armor of Torrent, being embraced and protected by Suzunagi. Cye rushes towards Suzunagi and asks what is going on, but Suzunagi tells him to stay away, and that it is her destiny to protect his future. A vision appears of Cye and his armor being auctioned, with the auctioneer stating that though Cye has lost his will to fight, he has still chosen the battlefield. Cye wonders why he made this decision, but Suzunagi tells him that it is due to his nature as a warrior. Suzunagi tells Cye that she can see all, and that she knows his future. She feels the need to protect him due to his virtue of kindness, as well as his decision to choose the armor. Cye says the armor will be a part of him forever, as well as fighting and violence. He asks Suzunagi why he needs to be protected, and she tells him that she must give up her life to protect his spirit, and to remain true to himself. Cye then receives a vision of Suzunagi being bound and captured, and attempts to rescue her. He asks Suzunagi if this is the future she foresaw, and refuses to let it happen by summoning his armor. A new Armor of Torrent appears, and a tear forms in its eye.

Sage tells him that Rowen and Cye are missing, and that he could be next. Sage reads the \"The Legend of the Five Warriors,\" wonders how the superstitions of a previous century could have such a large impact on their lives. He mentions that though becoming Ronin Warriors fulfilled their dreams, he was more than prepared to put down the sword for the rest of his life. He reflects that though the armors helped rescue the world from evil, he still feels guilt from the anguish that were indirectly caused by them. When thinking of the play, Sage speculates that it was likely written to warn future generations of the evil nature of their armors. Sage notices the play foretells of a child who will be sent forward from the past to show how them how to live as individuals. He believes that she was likely sent to fulfill their innermost wishes, and that a grudge may exist between the armors. Discovering a passage of the Inferno Armor destroying the others, Sage notices that this has not happened as of yet and wonders if it is their destiny. Realizing that something must have happened in the past, Sage comes to the conclusion that their time as Ronin Warriors is not done as of yet, and that another battle may be coming. The Armor of Halo then manifests in front of him and attempts to attack, but Sage does not defend himself. The armor stops his attack, to which sage says the time of fighting force with force is finished, causing the armor to disappear. Sage mentions that he can see the path, to which Suzunagi looks on in surprise. Looking at the book once again, Sage notices a drawing of the building where Rowen had previously went to before he disappears and rushes towards it. Kento attempts to jump off a skyskraper but is stopped before he lands, to which he concludes that someone must be keeping them alive to summon the Inferno Armor. Suzunagi then attacks Kento with the Armor of Hardrock. She confirms that she wants to summon the Inferno Armor to guide it to its proper path, and for that reason she created new sets of armor. Kento tells Suzunagi that the Inferno Armor causes nothing but destruction, but Suzunagi already knows this, saying that darkness shrouds the Inferno Armor and the light is needed to free the world. The new Armor of Hardrock approaches Kento, and though he attempts to fight it, he causes no damage. A light then engulfs the area, showing a flashback of a young Suzunagi and her mother. Sage soon arrives and notices the new Armor of Hardrock, but upon seeing him Suzunagi retreats. The Armor of Hardrock attempts to follow her, but Kento jumps upon it, causing the two to disappear.

Suzunagi reflects on changing of the seasons, how they are self-contained from her guilt, and whether she belongs in the current world. She commends on how the beauty in nature transcends everything in the heart, providing a sense of comfort and balance that can put the soul at ease. As Suzunagi pulls out the new Armor of the Halo out of a chest, Sage approaches her. Suzunagi asks Sage what he is looking for, but Sage mentions that she summoned him. She tells him that she has no idea what her motivations are, but Sage deduces that it likely has something to do with the Inferno Armor and its nature of destruction, and tells her that the Ronin Warriors no longer want anything to with that life. Suzunagi responds that she wants to remove all sorrow from the world, but Sage tells her that doing so will remove all good things from the world as well. Sage is then transported to town an Edo-era town center where a performance of \"The Legend of the Five Armors\" is playing, and where a young Suzunagi and her mother live. The area is soon attacked by battleships. Sage then sees the play's author, Suzunagi's father, being punished by death due to his insisting its contents are real, causing panic on the way of life amongst the people. Sage, clad in his old armor, attempts to destroy the battleships but inadvertently destroys the town center as well. Suzunagi tells Sage that in this world, he is the spirit and that since he tried to fix the area's situation, he should not blame her for doing the same and that this is why they need the Inferno Armor.

Ryo asks Mia why she is trying to get him from confronting Suzunagi, noting that the other Ronin Warriors have disappeared. Mia suggests that he may not need to fight and suggests a different approach. Ryo listens to voicemails from the other four members. Rowen's talks about \"The Legend of the Five Armors\" and its ending, claiming that it ends by ending in a bottomless pit of darkness, talking about the human spirit, how the Ronin Warriors are doomed to repeat the cycle of violence without getting anywhere, and how the armors are destroyed at the end of the play. He also mentions that another set of armors is to use another set to do it, predicts a final battle is coming, and urges them to end the cycle. Cye's reflects on their previous battles, but that he is now more worried about his immediate surroundings and himself. He feels the armors have deep problems within themselves that are beyond his control, but he now wants to focus on what he can control - his own life. Kento's inquires on the occurrences of the last few days, and how he wishes they can over come their tormentor with The Inferno Armor. He tells them that he is afraid, but he is afraid because he is unsure of who they are fighting - whether it is a new villain, or themselves. Sage's urges Ryo to have faith in their emotions, telling them it is important to cause empathy for others. He feels that the armors had an influence on them for several generations, and that though they entwined themselves in dark moments in human history, but it is ultimately the human spirit that is in control of them. It is through this mix that has cause strong compassion within the Ronin Warriors as well as humanity. \n\nA foreign government meets and discuss the appearances of dynasty soldiers fighting and causing damage in the city. They determine that similar occurrences happened in Japan, and Mia, who is attendance, stands and claims she has all the answer they are looking for. Ryo confronts Suzunagi at last, and claims that he can feel the others. This causes the four new armors to appear, and Ryo tells Suzunagi that he will comply with her plan since he has confidence in the others. Suzunagi tells Ryo the unique toll the armors have taken on each of its members: Rowen understands the mistakes of the past, Cye is searching for peace of mind, Kento wonders if the fighting will never end, while Sage has denied himself all battles. She asks Ryo what he thinks will be the end result of following their armors and then tells him to summon the Inferno Armor to end her suffering. Ryo tells her that he is taking the armor in order to find the answers to all of their questions, as  the darkness and suffering they encountered had left all of their hearts scarred. Suzunagi helps Ryo put on his new Armor of Wildfire, and Ryo tells her he will help relieve her from her curse. Ryo reunites with the other warriors and are transported with Suzunagi towards a graveyard filled with the other warriors who rejected the power of the armors. Suzunagi tells the warriors she will kill them there, but soon sees the spirit of her mother, who tells her that her sadness and suffering caused a great darkness to grow within her. Suzunagi's flashback of the battleship attack continues, where she witnesses her mother being killed in a fire right in front of her eyes. Her mother tells her that she placed her love in a small corner of the armors, and trusted that the five spirits that would come in a latter era would help Suzunagi finally ease her of her suffering. Suzunagi's mother tells her that she will always love her, and she thanks the Ronin Warriors for guiding the Suzunagi back to the light. Suzunagi says she at last has the peace she has been waiting for. The five Ronin Warriors then gather for the final time in the series. As they peer over the city in their new armors, they accept their roles as Ronin Warriors, saying as long as they have love, their spirits will never guide them wrong.\n\nA post-credit scene shows Ully, now in middle school, winning a kendo tournament.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Ronin Warriors]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Ronin Warriors'' episodes}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2010}}\n\n'''[[Ronin Warriors]]''' is a Japanese [[anime]] series and [[manga]] adaptation created by [[Hajime Yatate]].

Combining Cye's Super Wave Smasher and Ryo's Flare Up Now, they defeat Sekhmet which Talpa is not pleased with.  Seeing the power of their teamwork, the two vow to find their friends and unite to defeat the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Splitting the Stone\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaigan!

After they are forced to abandon Mia's jeep, Sage heads off on his own and orders Mia to return to the city, but she refuses and follows him.  A snowstorm starts and Mia is attacked by a pack of wild wolves, but is saved by Sage.  Cale tries to take them out with an avalanche, but they jump out of the way and the wolves are swept away by the avalanche.  Knowing it is too dangerous for Mia to leave if Talpa or his Warlords caused that, Sage allows Mia to come with him and they head to a giant rock called The Throne of the Gods.  Mia believes that this is what the line of the poem \"burning within a throne of rock\" meant when it referred to Kento's location.  Cale attacks the two and Sage tries to break the rock with his Thunder Bolt Cut, but does no damage to it.  Cale thrusts his sword into the rock and it will seek out Kento's heart and kill him before he wakes.  Sage and Cale battle, but Sage is unable to defeat him and he and Mia fall over a cliff next a waterfall.  The two fall into a cave and as they lay unconscious, the Ancient One appears and tells Sage that he needs to unlock the full power of his armor by achieving concentration of both mind and body then disappears before Sage wakes up.  Mia decides to distract Cale while Sage rescues Kento and upon reaching a cliff-top, calls Cale out.  He doesn't appear, but she notices the Ancient One and remembers how he dissolved the Circle of Power and gave the Ronins back their armor and saved her and Sage from drowning and wonders why he just doesn't save Kento himself.  As he walks away, Mia calls after him and follows, but he disappears as the snow starts up again.  Cale catches her and dangles her in a waterfall to draw the meditating Sage out.  When that fails, he freezes the waterfall, but Sage emerges and saves Mia.  With his full power unlocked, it restores life to the land and he successfully uses the Thunder Bolt Cut on the rock as the sword reaches Kento.  At first it appears as if Sage acted too late, but Kento bursts out of the rock and causes an explosion that blows Cale away.  With Kento rescued, the three head back to the city to reunite with the others and find Rowen.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Friend or Foe\n| TranslitTitle       = Genmash\u014d, Rajura no Sakuryaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u5e7b\u9b54\u5c06\u3001\u87ba\u546a\u7f85\u306e\u7b56\u7565\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|6|25}}\n| AltDate             = July 5, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa sends Dais to destroy the Ronin Warriors before they can locate and rescue Rowen.  As they drive back to the city, Mia explains the poem to Sage and Kento, explaining that the last verse that will lead them to Rowen is \"floating amongst the eyes of the ages, unmoored in the stream of the sky,\" but she has no idea what this means.  At a temple, Ryo, Cye, Ully and White Blaze wait for the others, but Ully is captured by Dais.  Ryo and Cye battle him to save Ully and manage to free Ully, but he nearly falls to his death before White Blaze saves him.  Dais easily defeats Ryo and Cye and then claims that he holds Rowen captive and tells them to meet him in the city of Sandai to rescue him.  Ryo and Cye head off to find Rowen, leaving Ully and White Blaze behind to let the others know what happened.  At Sandai, Ryo and Cye find Rowen held captive by Dynasty soldiers.  The two armor up and destroy the soldiers and it is revealed that \"Rowen\" is actually an illusion and that it is really Dais.  Dais creates an illusion so that Ryo and Cye each believe that they are fighting Dais, but are really fighting each other.  The two use their ultimate attacks on each other, and knock each other out, realizing the truth just after they attack.  Dais prepares to finish them, but the others arrive and he decides to do the same to Sage and Kento.  Sage sees through the illusion and drops his weapon, but Kento doesn't and beats Sage up.  After the truth is revealed, Kento turns on Dais and uses his Iron Rock Crusher to drive him off.  While the group recovers from their wounds, Ryo sees a shooting star and realizes that \"unmoored in the stream of the sky\" means that Rowen is floating in outer space and Mia believes that he's right.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Wildfire in the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Rekka, Tenk\u016b o Sukue\n| NativeTitle         = \u70c8\u706b\u3001\u5929\u7a7a\u3092\u3059\u304f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|2}}\n| AltDate             = July 6, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Now that they know where Rowen is, the Warriors try to figure out how to get to him.  Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Talpa will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be.  Mia proposes that two of the Warriors find out Talpa's plan while the other two return to the city.  When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Mia chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Ully to tell Mia when she wakes up.  Talpa summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a massive supernatural construct called a Dark Matrix that will be able to destroy anything it's sent against.  Talpa plans to send it to destroy Rowen.  As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the Dark Matrix is, Talpa sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them.  Though they easily defeat them, the Dark Matrix is launched, but the Ancient One intervenes and destroys it.  Talpa calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento.  The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building.  However, the energy from the Dark Matrix strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death.  The Dark Matrix starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the matrix.  Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the Dark Matrix launches into space.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = In the Sea of the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u016bketsu!

Talpa appears to the others and taunts them about the fact that Ryo and Rowen will soon be dead and sends his soldiers to face them.  Anubis asks for a fair fight against Ryo, claiming it won't be victory if the Warriors aren't defeated in a fair fight, but Talpa refuses to listen to him and plans to use the power of the Nether Realm to destroy the Warriors and sends Anubis away.  Inside the Dark Matrix, as Ryo is slowly crushed, he realizes that if he doesn't do something both he and Rowen will die.  Channeling the energy his armor is absorbing, Ryo launches Flare Up Now and destroys the Dark Matrix from within.  Seeing this from the ground, the other Warriors despair, but continue fighting.  Ryo survives the explosion, but passes out and starts to drift out into space.  However, Rowen wakes up and uses his bow to reel Ryo in.  Rowen propels them back to Earth which the other Warriors witness and rejoice.  Anubis senses it too and heads out to stop Ryo and Rowen while Talpa realizes that another power has awakened inside of Anubis.  Rowen doesn't remember what happened and before Ryo can explain, they are attacked by Anubis.  Ryo is injured and weakened from the energy ball and fails when he tries Flare Up Now on Anubis who captures him and Rowen with Quake With Fear.  However, Anubis hesitates to kill the helpless Ryo with his desire for a fair fight conflicting with his Dynasty morals.  Before he can decide, Rowen hits him with Arrow Shockwave.  Anubis survives the attack, but his mask and helmet breaks in half, revealing to a shocked Rowen that he's human.  Anubis tries to attack Rowen again, but is stopped by Talpa himself as his loyalty seems to be faltering.  Talpa teleports Anubis back to his castle.  The other Warriors, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and the Ronin Warriors are finally reunited.

A bank of think fog rolls over Toyama and Mia reveals that it is part of the castle's defenses.  The group walks along and comes to a bank of thick black fog that's another part of the defenses and Kento tries to enter with a vehicle, but is attacked by streams of energy and driven out.  The energy attacks the rest of the group, but they manage to escape.  In the castle, Talpa summons Dais to deal with the Warriors and he convinces Talpa to open the gates and let the Warriors in so he can draw them into a trap, explaining that their armor will be easier to control inside the castle with the hep of the Nether Spirits.  Talpa agrees, but warns Dais that he will be very angry if Dais fails to stop the Warriors.  The fog is lifted and the group is able to see the four gates to Talpa's castle, but decide to leave Mia and Ully behind as it is too dangerous.  Ryo refuses to listen to Ully's pleas to let him come and slaps him, causing Ully to run off.  Mia follows him and Ryo sends White Blaze after them to protect them while he and the other Warriors enter the gates, closing them behind them.  Dais arrives and opens the gates, summoning the Nether Spirits.  Unable to defeat Dais, the Warriors try to summon their armor, but the spirits block their powers and Dais easily defeats them.  Mia finds Ully who knows Ryo never meant to hurt him and convinces her that they need to help the Warriors.  They notice their friends in trouble and start to go to help them, but the spirits attack them, but the Ancient One's staff appears and drives them away.  Dais ties up the Warriors and offers Ryo his life in exchange for serving Talpa, but Ryo refuses so Dais cuts him down to kill him.  Before he can, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and Dais tries to attack them, but the Ancient One's staff protects them and drives away the spirits.  With the spirits gone, Ryo is able to summon his armor and blasts Dais away with Flare Up Now.  The attack also destroys the castle gates.  Talpa promises that Ryo will fall and won't be able to defeat him.  Ryo apologizes to Ully and thanks him and Mia for saving him.

Ully rushes off wanting to find his parents and Mia follows, but an army of Dynasty soldiers attack the Warriors.  The soldiers also go after Mia and Ully along with possessed cars and it forces the Warriors to split up which Sage realizes is the Dynasty's intention: to use Mia and Ully to split the Warriors up so they're weaker.  Sage, Mia and Ully escape the subway only to be confronted by Dynasty soldiers.  Sage armors up and takes them out while across the city the other Warriors take out the soldiers attacking them, but they are scattered.  A building is brought down forcing Sage, Ully and Mia back into the subway where they are confronted by Cale.  He absorbs all the light in the subway and Sage's light power.  Sage is unable to unleash his Thunder Bolt Cut for fear of hitting Mia and Ully and Cale captures him with his Black Lightning Flash.  The attack drains Sage of his energy and causes his armor to disappear, but before it can kill him, Ully attacks Cale with the Ancient One's staff.  Ully is injured by an attack from Cale, but the staff frees Sage and restores his power along with the light in the subway.

Kento is skeptical at first that it is really Rowen, but Rowen makes a joke about how he found Kento by his growling stomach and he seems to be convinced.  Meanwhile, Talpa addresses Cale, Dais and Sekhmet and informs them that together the Ronin armors are unbeatable, but now that they're separate, they are vulnerable.  He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan.  In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy.  Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again.  Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the celing, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field.  There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Talpa speaks to him.  Talpa reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin.  He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conquer and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust.  Talpa believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conquer everything.  The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but it is revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions.  He and Talpa try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn.  Dais and Talpa claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thirsty of the group and thus he will be the first to turn.  Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill.  Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat.  After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher.  The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position.  Talpa speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side.  Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen.  Talpa congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part.

Anubis protests at first, but after the spirits powers take effect, he breaks free of his binds and is sent by Talpa to enact the next phase of his plan.  At an amusement park, while Ully heads off with White Blaze to play, Dynasty soldiers attack.  Sage battles them and is nearly beaten, but is saved by Ryo and Cye.  Together they defeat the Dynasty soldiers in the park and in a subway and decide that following the subway might lead them to Talpa's castle.  Rowen and Kento arrive having followed the sounds of battle, but Kento displays doubts about his future when they refer to the soldiers as \"Dynasty twerps\" wondering if he'll become a \"Dynasty twerp\" too when his armor turns him evil.  Anubis arrives, his eyes glowing red occasionally and proves to be more powerful than ever.  The Warriors except for Kento armor up, with Kento's own doubts combined with Anubis being human increasing his fear of what he could become.  At the insistence of the others, Kento tries to power up, but fails due to his fears about his armor.  Kento explains what happened to the others and his fears that if he uses the armor he will become like the Dark Warlords.  As a result, Kento refuses to fight with his armor and without it, the other Warriors are weakened and no match for Anubis.  Talpa is pleased as without Kento the Warriors will be easy for Anubis, who the Nether Spirits are keeping in control, to defeat.  Anubis proves too powerful for the Warriors and defeats them with his Quake With Fear.  The Ancient One appears nearby and tells the Warriors to trust their armor, that it responds to what's in their hearts.  Anubis goes to finish Ryo, but Ully and White Blaze try to stop him.  Anubis easily throws them aside, injuring them, but Ully's courage causes Kento to summon his armor, saying that Ully taught him what real courage is.  Anubis tries to attack again with Quake With Fear, but Kento hits him with Iron Rock Crusher.  Not only does Kento's attack knock Anubis out, but it drives the spirits influence from his body.  However, it leaves the Warriors wondering what does it mean for them that a human is wearing evil armor.  Talpa tries to pull Anubis back to his castle, but the Ancient One intervenes and pulls Anubis to him instead.

The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Raid on Talpa's Castle\n| TranslitTitle       = Totsuny\u016b, Arago-j\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a81\u5165\u3001\u30a2\u30e9\u30b4\u57ce\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|20}}\n| AltDate             = July 17, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, leaving behind Mia, Ully and White Blaze who wish them good luck, enter the Ancient One's bridge.

Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Talpa then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyways. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Talpa and the two meet up and finally confront Talpa face to face and demand answers. Talpa explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Talpa to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle.

Meanwhile, Mia and Ully become determined to help the Ronin Warriors and ride White Blaze through the bridge to the castle where they dodge Dynasty attacks. Talpa watches as the Warriors fight with some success against the Warlords and realizes that their armor grows stronger the more they battle and he needs that for himself. When the Warriors manage to get past the Warlords, Talpa calls them off and demands the Warlords give their armor to him. They agree and Talpa absorbs the Warlords and starts building a physical body for himself. Mia, Ully and White Blaze find Ryo in a lot of pain and come under attack by a Dynasty army but are saved by Rowen and Cye and Rowen destroys most of the army with Arrow Shockwave. The Ronins then destroy much of the rest and form an energy pyramid that destroys the rest. Talpa reveals that the source of the armor is that it originally belonged to him before the Ancient One stole it and tried to hide it from him and attacks with his hand, injuring Ryo and causing his armor to disappear and absorbing Rowen, Cye and Kento.

However, before he can harm or absorb Ryo, the other Warriors, who are still alive inside Talpa, fight back and manage to force Talpa to let Ryo go. Ryo becomes determined to find someway to free his friends and kill Talpa, but is unsure how while Talpa grows stronger by feeding off the fear of the people he has captured which gives Mia and Ully hope as that means that Ully's parents and the other people Talpa has captured are still alive. Talpa chases Ryo who is reluctant to destroy him as doing so will kill the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo is nearly absorbed by Talpa, but White Blaze saves him and they fight Talpa who forces the other Ronin Warriors to use their attacks against Ryo.

However, the spirit of the Ancient One appears to him to show him how Talpa tried to take over the world in the past. The Ancient One shows Ryo how he defeated Talpa and killed him, but Talpa swore that with his armor he would return one day and returned to the Nether World as a soul. The Ancient One, knowing that with Talpa's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Talpa's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to the Ancient One, not necessarily to Talpa's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Talpa's side. The Ancient One explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after the Ancient One explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Talpa who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below. Inside Talpa, Ryo watches as the spirit of the Ancient One apologizes to the Warriors for involving them in the battle against Talpa who appears and tries to make Ryo despair by claiming his friends now hate and feel betrayed by him. Ryo refuses to give into despair and calls upon his friends to help him fight once more. Ryo emerges from Talpa and absorbs the power of the other four armors to form a new armor, the Inferno Armor. With the Inferno, Ryo is more than a match for Talpa and blasts him with Flare Up Now, destroying him and his castle and releasing the other Ronin Warriors.

They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them.

Mia explains that the swords couldn't handle the intensity of the Inferno armor and continuing to use it as Ryo did could result in it failing him. Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Ully suggests finding him a new one, causing Mia to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for.

He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water.

In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword.

This causes life to be restored to the land.

As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Talpa of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what the Ancient One told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are.

Anubis explains that he is now following the path of the Ancient One and his power, but warns that he can't protect the Warriors from everything and that they must be careful of the traps of the Nether Realm. While Anubis doesn't agree with what they are doing, he does agree to help all he can before leaving. In the city, they come under attack from Lady Kayura, but again prove no match for her even with their armor. After White Blaze scratches her, Lady Kayura blasts him, but he emerges as Black Blaze and shields Ryo and Rowen from another attack. Lady Kayura turns the ground into quicksand to capture them, but Anubis appears and frees them and opens a portal into the Nether Realm which Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze jump into. Lady Kayura promises to get them next time while Mia and Ully hope that they succeed and return safely.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 30\n| Title               = Talpa Turns the Tide\n| TranslitTitle       = Koko wa Y\u014djakai ka?\n| NativeTitle         = \u3053\u3053\u306f\u5996\u90aa\u754c\u304b?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|12|17}}\n| AltDate             = August 4, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Mia and Ully look across the city which has been badly damaged by Lady Kayura's attack and worry about the Ronin Warriors. Anubis appears and pledges to help the Warriors stop Talpa or die trying, but Mia and Ully fear him due to his past actions. Anubis convinces them of his sincerity and accepting him as a friend, they invite him to stay with them. Anubis explains to them how four hundred years ago he was a warrior that had become extremely power-hungry and bloodthirsty which caused him to join Talpa, but the Ancient One showed him that that wasn't a good thing and that Talpa wasn't his destiny as he thought. He now realizes that his destiny is to stop Talpa. Anubis senses the presence of Dais and forces him to show himself. Dais claims that all of the Ronin Warriors have been captured by Talpa, but Anubis points out that Ryo and Rowen are still free. Dais explains that they are merely being toyed with by Talpa and attacks Anubis who easily defeats him, knocking his helmet off and revealing his face to Ully and Mia. Anubis refuses to kill him, saying that Dais' armor protects him and tries to convince Dais that the armor's power doesn't come from Talpa like he believes but that Talpa wants it for himself before he, Ully and Mia leave. In the Nether World Ryo meets up with Rowen and White Blaze and a gate appears in front of them which they travel through. There they are met by a Nether Spirit who claims that Cye, Sage and Kento are merely guests of Talpa and asks them to join them, but to give up their armor first. However, they know that the spirit is lying and refuse and the spirit leaves and Talpa's castle appears nearby. Talpa visits the captured Warriors who are being drained by Nether Spirits and has the spirits drain a bunch of their power at once and give it to him, allowing him to create a sword from the power of their armor to defeat Ryo and Rowen with. Talpa then sends Lady Kayura to give the sword to a Dynasty warlord named Dala to use against Ryo and Rowen and capture them. However, upon returning to her room where she is visited by Talpa, Lady Kayura shows doubts about if what she is doing is right. As Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze make their way to the castle, they are surrounded by a massive army of Dynasty soldiers and are left fighting what looks like a hopeless battle.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 31\n| Title               = Legend of the White Armor\n| TranslitTitle       = Densetsu no Yoroi, Kik\u014dtei\n| NativeTitle         = \u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u93a7\u3001\u8f1d\u714c\u5e1d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|12|24}}\n| AltDate             = August 7, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo and Rowen battle the army and eventually manage to escape it, but are confronted by Dala whose sword is able to easily deflect Ryo's. Dala reveals the origin of his sword to their shock. Meanwhile, the Dark Warlords worry about being confronted by Ryo and Rowen with the power of the Inferno Armor and beg Talpa to destroy them and end it. Talpa summons Badamon, Lord of the Nether Spirits to explain the story behind the Inferno. Badamon explains that it came to be when the world was plagued by evil a long time ago. The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conquer the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor. Rowen blasts the roof off of the other Ronin Warriors prison with his Arrow Shockwave as a signal and they send their armor power to Ryo who forms the Inferno. Ryo destroys Dala and his sword with Rage of Inferno and in his normal armor, helps Rowen defeat the Dynasty soldiers he is fighting.

Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen try to make their way through a maze to Talpa's castle. Badamon reports to Talpa a plan to take control of the Inferno armor: transfer the evil power of the Dark Warlords armors to Ryo which would then overwhelm him then make him summon the Inferno. As he would be under the influence of the evil armors, he would then do what they want. Talpa agrees, but tells Badamon not to tell the Dark Warlords which he agrees with as they may change sides if they realize they are being used. Badamon asks for Lady Kayura's help and gives her a magic dust that will allow her to control Ryo. Ryo and Rowen try to make their way to Talpa's castle undetected, but are found and blocked in and the Dark Warlords and some Dynasty soldiers are sent to confront them. They defeat the soldiers and escape, but are confronted by Lady Kayrua who uses the dust on the Warlords, Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze and forces Ryo to summon the Inferno using the power of Rowen and the Dark Warlords armors with the Nether Spirits and the dust to control him. However, instead of the Inferno being controlled by the Dark Warlords armors, it works in reverse, controlling them and making them attack Lady Kayura. However, they are no match for her and she easily defeats them. She wakes Ryo, but he drives the Nether Spirits and dust's influence from his body and battles Lady Kayura. Ryo uses Rage of Inferno while Lady Kauyra uses Star Sword Scream, but Ryo destroys her sword with his attack as well as the nearby area and she retreats. However, Talpa is pleased as the Inferno Armor holds powers that even he was unaware of.

Ryo, exhausted and in pain from the battle and Rowen rest and discuss how Ryo didn't feel any different after absorbing the power of the Dark Warlords. This leads Rowen to theorize that perhaps they aren't all bad as they protected Ryo briefly from Lady Kayura. While Lady Kayura lost against Ryo, Talpa is still pleased with her as the Armor of Inferno was proven to have the power to destroy the mortal world like Talpa wants. Ully, Mia and Anubis look through Mia's grandfather's data, looking for anything they can use against the Dynasty and Anubis spots a symbol that Talpa uses and becomes determined to find out what it is as it may be important. Mia discovers that the symbol stands for the Jewel of Life, an object capable of destroying Talpa which was hidden by the very first Ancients. After the discovery, Anubis senses something and when investigating, comes under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Anubis fights them and they alert Badamon of Mia's discovery. Badamon orders the soldiers not to let Mia, Ully and Anubis escape with the information and two soldiers lure Anubis away while another tries to kill Mia and Ully. Anubis defeats the soldiers and Mia locates the a map leading to the Jewel of Life which Anubis realizes is near water. Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen contemplate how the Dark Warlords almost seemed to turn good and worry about their friends. Needing to stop Anubis, Mia and Ully from finding the Jewel, Badamon dispatches a Dynasty warrior named Gash to stop them, explaining that legend says that the Jewel is the heart of the nine armors and beats strong in the heart of the pure and gives strength to the weak and thus is a threat to Talpa and his empire. Mia uncovers the same thing, reading that the Jewel gives the armors their power and figuring out with Anubis that it must be in Jewel Lake. The three head there with Anubis planning to travel to the Nether World afterwards to help the Ronin Warriors, but refusing to allow Ully and Mia to come as it is too dangerous. At Jewel Lake, Anubis parts the water with the Ancient One's staff and is able to use the staff to open the tomb that's revealed at the bottom. In the tomb they find the armors of the Ancients that guard the tomb, murals of the battles between Hariel and evil in the past and the Jewel of Life. When Ully picks up the Jewel, the Ancient One speaks to them telling them that only the pure of heart can use the Jewel as in evil hands it could destroy the world. Gash arrives with Dynasty soldiers and attacks, but the Ancient armors, possessed by the souls of their wearers, destroy the soldiers and when Gash threatens Mia and Ully, Anubis stabs him through the back with the Ancient One's staff, killing him. At the Ancient One's request, Anubis releases the souls in the armors to move on, their job now finished and puts the Jewel around Mia's neck when Ully gives it to him, saying that Ully and Mia are the purest of heart people he knows and they will all go together to save their friends.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| Title               = Strata's Defiant Stand\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenk\u016b, Kizudarake no Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7a7a\u3001\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306e\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|1|28}}\n| AltDate             = August 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis, Mia and Ully contemplate the power of the Jewel of Life and wonder how it is supposed to defeat Talpa and Mia gives it to Ully to wear. Meanwhile Dynasty soldiers cause havok and destruction in the city, easily repelling all human efforts to stop them. Badamon approaches Talpa with fears about allowing Ryo and Rowen free rein within the castle before a structure the Nether Spirits are building which Badamon calls the Tower of Pain is completed due to the unfathomable power of the Inferno Armor, but Talpa assures him that they won't be free for long as he is drawing them into a trap. At Mia's home, Anubis contemplates the war with the Dynasty and looks for a sign from the Ancient One when it will be time for him to complete his own destiny when suddenly the Ancient One's staff and the Jewel of Life glow, causing snow. Ryo and Rowen continue to make their way through the maze, avoiding Dynasty soldiers and trying to find a way into the castle. They get sucked into a wall while trying to climb it and end up trapped in the dungeon. Upon blasting their way out of the room, they are confronted by Lady Kayura. The two fight her to no avail and she tricks Ryo into launching Flare Up Now at her then dodges, causing him to hit a structure which drains his armor of power. Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Talpa's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others. As Ryo is unconscious and completely drained, Rowen holds off Lady Kayura while sending White Blaze to carry Ryo to safety. Rowen battles Lady Kayura but is no match for her, getting blasted so high into the air at one point that he nearly falls to his death before his armor saves him. At the same time, Anubis uses both the Jewel of Life and the Ancient One's staff to carry him, Mia and Ully to Ryo and Rowen to help them out. During his fight with Lady Kayura, Rowen spots White Blaze carry Ryo onto a barge and take off and he lands on the barge to protect them but is defeated. However, as Anubis, Mia and Ully approach, the power of the Jewel of Life causes a water spout that knocks Lady Kayura off the barge and forces her back ashore.

Meanwhile, Talpa speaks with Badamon who has prepared altars for the nine armors and has been having his Nether Spirits \"purify\" the bodies of the Dark Warlords who Talpa only sees as useful tools. Anubis and White Blaze successfully protect Mia and Ully from Dynasty soldiers while Ryo and Rowen battle against more soldiers and Lady Kayura with little luck. Realizing they need the other Ronin Warriors to win, Rowen sacrifices himself to buy them some more time by blasting Lady Kayura into the air and trying to fight her there, but is instead defeated and apparently killed. Ryo prepares to continue the battle with Lady Kayura, but Anubis interrupts and tells Ryo to let him handle it while Ryo goes off to rescue the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Mia and Ully, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Mia and Ully uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Talpa isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with the Ancient One's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where it is revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues. Rowen uses the strength of his armor's power of Life in the form of his arrows to try to awaken the others before collapsing. Ryo arrives near the other Warriors and is confronted by the Dark Warlords and defeated, however, Ully, Mia and White Blaze arrive and when Ully rushes forward to help, the Jewel protects Ryo and harms the Dark Warlords, driving them off. However, Lady Kayura arrives and like the Staff of the Ancients, the Jewel has no effect on her. As it looks like it is over for Ryo, Rowen and the other Ronin Warriors appear to once again help Ryo fight the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Cheap Tricks\n| TranslitTitle       = Kessen!

However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Ully and Mia at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when the Ancient One's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Mia and Ully, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together. They reach Cye in time for Anubis to restore light to the area with the staff which also drives off Cale. The group quickly reunites with the others and Ryo forms the Inferno. With the Inferno, Ryo is able to block Lady Kayura's Star Sword Scream and blasts her with Rage of Inferno, breaking her amulet off her neck.

The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Talpa. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of the Ancient One's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Talpa as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of the Ancient One's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Talpa sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords. Badamon goes to Lady Kayura and successfully possesses her to do the Dynasty will while Anubis senses that something has happened to her and realizing that she is the last of the Ancient One's clan, becomes determined to save her like the Ancient One saved him. The Dark Warlords attack and Anubis is forced to fight them briefly until he uses the Ancient One's staff to split the land and send them away. As the Warriors defeat the Dynasty soldiers, Lady Kayura arrives atop a Dynasty Dark Matrix and Sage and Cye's attacks have absolutely no effect against it so they form the Inferno Armor. However, the Inferno has no effect against the Matrix either and it crashes into Ryo and detonates, dispelling the Inferno and knocking the Ronin Warriors out, except for Ryo.

The possessed Lady Kayura tries to convince Anubis to surrender while Anubis tries to convince the Dark Warlords that they are just being used which Lady Kayura proves by trapping them in spheres of energy. Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Mia confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this.

Everyone travels back to the mortal world to continue the fight and the Ronin Warriors combine their armors upon Ryo once more to form the Inferno Armor and he unleashes a column of flame that destroys Badamon. Mia, Ully and Black Blaze arrive with the Soul Swords and using them, Ryo battles Talpa and unleashes the Rage of Inferno, but Talpa is able to turn the attack aside and incapacitate Ryo. Talpa then tries to absorb him, but urged on by the spirit of Anubis, Ryo doesn't give up and instead projects his body and soul into Talpa, holding him still so the other Warriors have a clear shot at him. Reluctantly as they might kill Ryo and all crying, the Ronin Warriors slash Talpa with their weapons, fatally injuring him. Ully calls out for Ryo to be saved and the Jewel of Life sends out a beam of energy that pulls Ryo safely out of Talpa as he explodes into pieces, finally destroyed while his tower and its influence as well as the Nether Realm disappear. Ryo thanks Ully for saving his life and everyone celebrates by throwing off their helmets, causing their armors to disappear. Lady Kayura congratulates the Warriors on defeating Talpa and as they are no longer needed, she and the former Dark Warlords return to the Nether Realm to rebuild while everyone celebrates by playing a game of catch with a ball of energy created by the Jewel.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n|}\n\n==OVAs==\n\n===Ronin Warriors: Gaiden===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #aaa;\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

He is soon attacked by an African warrior who fights with speed, agility and power beyond the normal person.

Cye tells the others he believes that their attempts will be helpless as they were not strong enough to overcome him, angering Kento. Kento blames Cye's hesitancy for Ryo and Sage's disappearance, to which Cye responds that he is tired of fighting and no longer wants to live the life of a Ronin Warrior. Rowen tells Cye that this is their destiny, to which he physically attacks both Rowen and Kento. Rowen then throws his Armor of Torrent into the lake. Ryo and Sage deduce that they are in Africa, and soon encounter the African warrior as well as a maiden. The African warrior again overpowers the Ryo and Sage, shattering their helmets and knocking them unconscious. The African maiden speaks to the warrior, whose name is revealed as Mukala, and asks why he brought the Ronin Warriors to fight in a distant land and if that is what the Black Inferno Armor wants. Mia notices that there is no record of the Black Inferno Armor, but is able to deduce that Mukala is located in Tanzania based on dialogue that they heard from him. Ryo and Sage are freed by the African maiden, who reveals her name as Naria and is engaged to Mukala, who is following an ancient tradition. As the strongest warrior in the village, he is able to don the Black Inferno Armor. Naria says that the White Inferno Armor and Black Inferno Armor cannot meet and begs them not to fight. Ryo tells Naria that he cannot summon his Inferno Armor without the others. Naria is surprised, saying that Mukala is able to summon the Black Inferno on his own, and that it may be testing Ryo and the White Inferno Armor. She also says the Black Inferno Armor is worshiped in their tribe, the Taulagi, as a god. Ryo is soon called to fight Mukala in a ritual, which Naria is vehemently against. She frees Ryo and Sage but they are soon found by Mukala.

Naria pleads with them to stop fighting, to which Ryo and Sage abide. They deduce that it is their armors that want to fight rather than themselves. Ryo refuses to fight and is then savagely beaten by Mukala. Sage saves Ryo from a fatal blow and resolves to keep fighting, but he too realizes that they have become pawns in a battle between the two Inferno Armors. He decides to stop fighting as well. Cye, still separated from the group and questioning his will to fight, is found by White Blaze. Kento, Rowen, Mia and Ully travel to Nairobi, Tanzania to find Ryo and Sage. They decide to decipher the conflict between the two armors rather leaving it as a contest of strength. As they attempt to locate the Taulagi village, they are attacked by the tribe. Kento and Ully become separated from Rowen and Mia, but spot Naria and follow her to Ryo and Sage's location. Rowen and Mia discover engravings in a cave, which speaks of The Tree of Life, whose evil light will inspire the people and save them from all that threaten their lives. The Tree of Life forms the entrance to their valley, while all is underneath the Black Inferno Armor. Kento attempts to rescue Ryo and Sage but is intercepted by Mukala. Kento's armor then flashes a darker color as he attempts to battle Mukala, which Ully notices as appearing more evil. Mia reads on the cave walls that if the Black and White Inferno Armors, which were both born in the valley, were to ever meet, that it would release an energy that would be too much for the universe to bear. Rowen's armor unlocks a power within the crystals around them which causes the lightning to strike The Tree of Life. More dark crystals arise, which Mukala uses to don the Black Inferno Armor. Rowen then arrives and tells Kento to stop fighting, telling them that another person's will is manipulating all of them into a dishonest fight. Naria tells Mukala the the armor has been influencing him negatively. Kento and Rowen attempt to attack Mukala, but both notice that it is their armor's will that is forcing them to fight rather than their own. Both then free themselves from their armor, to which Mia notices that there is a split between their armors as well as their own virtues that represent the forces of good. Back in Japan, Cye then retrieves his Armor of Torrent, saying he will wear it again to save his friends, but also to test to see whether his will is stronger than his armor's.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = The More Than Sadness, Seek!\n| TranslitTitle       = Kanashimi o Koeru Mono o Motomete!\n| NativeTitle         = \u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u3001\u6c42\u3081\u3066!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|1|11}}\n| AltDate             = April 2, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Naria, Mia and Ully attempt to find ingredients to make medicine for the ailing Ronin Warriors. Mia again reiterates her belief that it was their armors that forced them to fight, rather than the Ronin Warriors themselves. Cye soon finds the group and uses his virtue to restore Ryo, Sage, Rowen, and Kento back to health. They notice the virtue has disappeared from his armor, noticing it must be removing themselves during this conflict. Naria explains the history of the armor and their tribe: the Black Inferno Armor appeared in the Valley of the Black Crystal, and that the Talaugi were worshiped because of this. The Black Inferno Armor was always worn by their tribe and protected them from outside influence, but one day it showed that it could move on its own power and revealed a darker side. When Mukala discovered there was another Inferno Armor, the Black Inferno Armor ordered that it find and fight it, to which Mukala obeyed. Naria is dismayed that Mukala has become overpowered by the Black Inferno Armor. Black Blaze soon separates himself from White Blaze, which then separates Cye from the Armor of Torrent, which moves on its own accord. The Ronin Warriors then decide to destroy both Inferno Armors, saying that the armors without virtue become sinister forces. Naria pleads with Mukala to end the conflict, but to no avail. White Blaze is soon attacked by the tribe, which then capture Mia, Ully and Naria. Black Blaze gives the Armor of Torrent to Mukala, who summons the other armors to create the Inferno Armor. The Ronin Warriors soon find Mukala, and though he attacks them, they state that they do not wish to fight them but rather want to confront the Inferno Armor. The two Inferno Armors manipulate the sun and moon, which creates an lunar eclipse that darkens the land. The Ronin Warriors see visions of the end of the world that would result from the two armors' lust for battle. They resolve to let their virtues win, and summon their own armor to battle The Inferno Armor, which is now acting on its own will. Despite being initially unable to cause any damage, the five decide to fight with their spirits as one, attacking The Inferno Armor with the power of their virtues. This defeats the evil spirit residing within, and Ryo is able to don The Inferno Armor once again. Ryo then commences battle with Mukala, who has donned the Black Inferno armor. Ryo again pleads with Mukala to end the battle, saying that an armor that has abandoned its spirit can only bring death. While the two continue to fight, their attacks bring shockwaves onto the landscape; Naria and White Blaze are soon caught in the crossfire and are dealt fatal blows. Mukala, mortified, surveys the damage; the Ronin Warriors use the opportunity attack him with their virtues to let him see the true nature of the human spirit. The attack succeeds. The eclipse soon clears, and the armors then disappear, but not before reviving Naria and White Blaze. Mukala then approaches Naria and warmly calls her by her name, as Ryo, Rowen, Sage, Cye, Kento, Mia and Ully look on.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n|}\n\n===Ronin Warriors: Message===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #aaa;\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

He is unsure who is calling upon them, as he feels his days of fighting should be behind him. A mysterious being known as Suzunagi soon covers the city with light beams, and attacks Rowen. Though Rowen is able to deflect her attacks, this confirms Suzunagi's suspicions that though they are no longer Ronin Warriors, they still have enhanced abilities. She tells Rowen that they will continue to be Ronin Warriors until they die, that she feels sorry for them and that they should curse the Ancient One for giving them their armors in the first place. A flashback shows the origins of the Armor of Strata: The Ancient One uncovers a box containing it, being relieved that it has not found its true master. He says that due to the impending evil that it is time to be called upon again. As he unlocks the Armor of Strata, he is met but a young Suzunagi, imploring him not to release the armor as it would ignite the fires of war. The Ancient One notices the girl is filled with bitterness of the past, and commands the Armor of Strata to release her from her anger. The young Suzunagi is able to evade the attack. In the present day, Rowen tells Suzunagi to relieve her hatred against the armors, and resolves to find the source behind her anger in order to put her at peace. Rowen uncovers Suzunagi's drawings of the armors, but notices that they are of different designs. He is then given a vision of Suzunagi proclaiming a hatred of the armors, as well as an attempt destroy them. Suzunagi tells Rowen that the sadness she felt as a child has evolved into hatred, and orders Rowen to kill her. Rowen refuses to harm her until he discovers why she hates the armors.

Ryo opens a package from Rowen, which consist of a book of the Edo period called \"The Legend of the Five Armors.\" It is a stage play about the Ronin Warriors and their battle against Talpa, but this was written back in the 19th Century before it became true. Rowen's package contains a letter stating that though the five have not seen each other since the armors disappeared, he believes they are being called again and will investigate. Ryo expresses disbelief that the play contains all of their battles, feeling as though they are puppets on a cardboard stage. Cye laments the idea that they are being drawn into battle again, wondering if this will define his life. He soon receives visions of avatars of samurai warriors attacking the city, but also of himself, wearing in the Armor of Torrent, being embraced and protected by Suzunagi. Cye rushes towards Suzunagi and asks what is going on, but Suzunagi tells him to stay away, and that it is her destiny to protect his future. A vision appears of Cye and his armor being auctioned, with the auctioneer stating that though Cye has lost his will to fight, he has still chosen the battlefield. Cye wonders why he made this decision, but Suzunagi tells him that it is due to his nature as a warrior. Suzunagi tells Cye that she can see all, and that she knows his future. She feels the need to protect him due to his virtue of kindness, as well as his decision to choose the armor. Cye says the armor will be a part of him forever, as well as fighting and violence. He asks Suzunagi why he needs to be protected, and she tells him that she must give up her life to protect his spirit, and to remain true to himself.

Sage tells him that Rowen and Cye are missing, and that he could be next. Sage reads the \"The Legend of the Five Warriors,\" wonders how the superstitions of a previous century could have such a large impact on their lives. He mentions that though becoming Ronin Warriors fulfilled their dreams, he was more than prepared to put down the sword for the rest of his life. He reflects that though the armors helped rescue the world from evil, he still feels guilt from the anguish that were indirectly caused by them. When thinking of the play, Sage speculates that it was likely written to warn future generations of the evil nature of their armors. Sage notices the play foretells of a child who will be sent forward from the past to show how them how to live as individuals. He believes that she was likely sent to fulfill their innermost wishes, and that a grudge may exist between the armors. Discovering a passage of the Inferno Armor destroying the others, Sage notices that this has not happened as of yet and wonders if it is their destiny. Realizing that something must have happened in the past, Sage comes to the conclusion that their time as Ronin Warriors is not done as of yet, and that another battle may be coming. The Armor of Halo then manifests in front of him and attempts to attack, but Sage does not defend himself. The armor stops his attack, to which sage says the time of fighting force with force is finished, causing the armor to disappear. Sage mentions that he can see the path, to which Suzunagi looks on in surprise. Looking at the book once again, Sage notices a drawing of the building where Rowen had previously went to before he disappears and rushes towards it. Kento attempts to jump off a skyskraper but is stopped before he lands, to which he concludes that someone must be keeping them alive to summon the Inferno Armor. Suzunagi then attacks Kento with the Armor of Hardrock. She confirms that she wants to summon the Inferno Armor to guide it to its proper path, and for that reason she created new sets of armor. Kento tells Suzunagi that the Inferno Armor causes nothing but destruction, but Suzunagi already knows this, saying that darkness shrouds the Inferno Armor and the light is needed to free the world. The new Armor of Hardrock approaches Kento, and though he attempts to fight it, he causes no damage. A light then engulfs the area, showing a flashback of a young Suzunagi and her mother. Sage soon arrives and notices the new Armor of Hardrock, but upon seeing him Suzunagi retreats. The Armor of Hardrock attempts to follow her, but Kento jumps upon it, causing the two to disappear.

She tells him that she has no idea what her motivations are, but Sage deduces that it likely has something to do with the Inferno Armor and its nature of destruction, and tells her that the Ronin Warriors no longer want anything to with that life. Suzunagi responds that she wants to remove all sorrow from the world, but Sage tells her that doing so will remove all good things from the world as well. Sage is then transported to town an Edo-era town center where a performance of \"The Legend of the Five Armors\" is playing, and where a young Suzunagi and her mother live.

Ryo asks Mia why she is trying to get him from confronting Suzunagi, noting that the other Ronin Warriors have disappeared. Mia suggests that he may not need to fight and suggests a different approach. Ryo listens to voicemails from the other four members. Rowen's talks about \"The Legend of the Five Armors\" and its ending, claiming that it ends by ending in a bottomless pit of darkness, talking about the human spirit, how the Ronin Warriors are doomed to repeat the cycle of violence without getting anywhere, and how the armors are destroyed at the end of the play. He also mentions that another set of armors is to use another set to do it, predicts a final battle is coming, and urges them to end the cycle. Cye's reflects on their previous battles, but that he is now more worried about his immediate surroundings and himself. He feels the armors have deep problems within themselves that are beyond his control, but he now wants to focus on what he can control - his own life. Kento's inquires on the occurrences of the last few days, and how he wishes they can over come their tormentor with The Inferno Armor. He tells them that he is afraid, but he is afraid because he is unsure of who they are fighting - whether it is a new villain, or themselves. Sage's urges Ryo to have faith in their emotions, telling them it is important to cause empathy for others. He feels that the armors had an influence on them for several generations, and that though they entwined themselves in dark moments in human history, but it is ultimately the human spirit that is in control of them. It is through this mix that has cause strong compassion within the Ronin Warriors as well as humanity. \n\nA foreign government meets and discuss the appearances of dynasty soldiers fighting and causing damage in the city. They determine that similar occurrences happened in Japan, and Mia, who is attendance, stands and claims she has all the answer they are looking for. Ryo confronts Suzunagi at last, and claims that he can feel the others. This causes the four new armors to appear, and Ryo tells Suzunagi that he will comply with her plan since he has confidence in the others. Suzunagi tells Ryo the unique toll the armors have taken on each of its members: Rowen understands the mistakes of the past, Cye is searching for peace of mind, Kento wonders if the fighting will never end, while Sage has denied himself all battles. She asks Ryo what he thinks will be the end result of following their armors and then tells him to summon the Inferno Armor to end her suffering. Ryo tells her that he is taking the armor in order to find the answers to all of their questions, as  the darkness and suffering they encountered had left all of their hearts scarred. Suzunagi helps Ryo put on his new Armor of Wildfire, and Ryo tells her he will help relieve her from her curse. Ryo reunites with the other warriors and are transported with Suzunagi towards a graveyard filled with the other warriors who rejected the power of the armors. Suzunagi tells the warriors she will kill them there, but soon sees the spirit of her mother, who tells her that her sadness and suffering caused a great darkness to grow within her. Suzunagi's flashback of the battleship attack continues, where she witnesses her mother being killed in a fire right in front of her eyes. Her mother tells her that she placed her love in a small corner of the armors, and trusted that the five spirits that would come in a latter era would help Suzunagi finally ease her of her suffering. Suzunagi's mother tells her that she will always love her, and she thanks the Ronin Warriors for guiding the Suzunagi back to the light. Suzunagi says she at last has the peace she has been waiting for. The five Ronin Warriors then gather for the final time in the series. As they peer over the city in their new armors, they accept their roles as Ronin Warriors, saying as long as they have love, their spirits will never guide them wrong.\n\nA post-credit scene shows Ully, now in middle school, winning a kendo tournament.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Ronin Warriors]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word reworded", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ronin_Warriors_episodes"}

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places.

Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House).

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi]]s of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]].

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

In 1990 he pleaded guilty to depositing $80,000 in worthless checks and impersonating a physician, but served, he said, fewer than 30 days.  In 1991, he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of credit card fraud and spent two years in federal prison.<ref name=\"wapost\" /> After his release in 1993, Trudeau joined a [[multi-level marketing]] firm, Nutrition for Life. The firm was successful until the Attorney General of Illinois charged that it was running a [[pyramid scheme]].

They promoted a range of products, including health aids, [[dietary supplement]]s (such as [[coral calcium]]), baldness remedies, addiction treatments, memory-improvement courses, reading-improvement programs and real estate investment strategies. The FTC took regulatory action against Trudeau, alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations. In 1998, he was fined. In 2004, he settled a contempt-of-court action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payment of a $2 million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref name=\"finalorder\" /><ref name=\"ban\" />\n\nIn 2004, Trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the U.S. The first book he published was a medical guide titled ''Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About'', which was published in 2005. The book was criticized for containing no natural cures.<ref name=\"nycpb\" /><ref name=\"Shapiro 2009\" /> Trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the FTC.<ref name=\"livescience1\">[http://www.livescience.com/health/060725_bad_book.html Revealing the Truth about Natural Cures]{{Clarify|date=August 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

According to Trudeau, the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses. Trudeau's books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop [[degenerative disease|degenerative conditions]] like [[cancer]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]], and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria, but rather by an imbalance in [[vitalism|vital energy]]. Science writer [[Christopher Wanjek]] critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his July 25, 2006 [[LiveScience|LiveScience.com]] health column.<ref name=\"livescience1\" />\n\nTrudeau went on to publish ''The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About'' and ''Debt Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About''. His writing has been commercially successful if not factual. In September 2005, ''Natural Cures'' was listed in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as the number-one-selling nonfiction book in the United States for 25 weeks. It has sold more than five million copies.<ref name=\"booksales\"/>\n\nTrudeau launched a self-titled [[Internet radio]] talk show in February 2009 which also aired on several small radio stations consisting of mostly [[brokered programming]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nTrudeau has been married at least three times.  Little is known about his first marriage, to Oleksandra Polozhentseva, a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrant.  His second union, in 2007, to Kristine Dorow, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] student whom he met in London, ended in annulment after four months.  In 2008 he married Natalya Babenko, another Ukrainian, who currently runs several of his former companies.  She has returned to her home in [[Kiev]], according to Trudeau.<ref>Gell, A.

He consented to an FTC ban applying to everything except publications that the FTC concluded would infringe upon his First Amendment rights. All of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books ''Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You To Know About'' and ''The Weight Loss Cure''. Notable co-hosts included Leigh Valentine (former wife of televangelist [[Robert Tilton]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tilton3.html |title=The Resurrection of Robert Tilton |publisher=Trinityfi.org |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728130645/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tilton3.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isitso.org/guide/whoiswho.html |title=Field Guide: Who's Who Digest of the Wild World of Religion |publisher=Isitso.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> and the late [[Tammy Faye Messner]] (the former Tammy Faye Bakker).\n\n=== Pharmaceutical companies ===\nTrudeau offers a [[conspiracy theory]], saying that the drug industry and the FDA work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning all-natural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry. Trudeau says that FDA commissioners who leave the FDA to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars. In any other industry, according to Trudeau, this would be called \"bribery,\" a \"conflict of interest\" or \"payoffs.\" Trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals (such as [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] and [[aspartame]]) to get people \"addicted to food\" and to \"make people obese.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About]] |last= Trudeau |first= Kevin |year= 2005 |publisher= Alliance Publishing |isbn= 0975599518 |chapter= 5 Why We Are Sick}}</ref>\n\n=== References to scientific studies ===\nOne of the major complaints about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence that he presents in the infomercials.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Barrett, S|authorlink=Stephen Barrett| title=What 'They' Don't Want You to Know | magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=January 2006 | volume=30 | issue=1 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_lsquotheyrsquo_donrsquot_want_you_to_know | access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref>  He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, he tells a story in an infomercial about \"a friend from England\" who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of [[St. John's Wort]] compared to two prescription medications.  These studies, the infomercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation.  In an interview, he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of \"FTC suppression\"; but readers can join his web site, where, for $9.99 a month or $499 for a lifetime, they can gain access to the special members-only section from which they can e-mail him for the information.<ref name = \"wapost\"/>\n\n=== Newspaper articles ===\nA pair of 2005 [[Associated Press]] articles by Candice Choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs.<ref name=\"ChoiAP2005\">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-28\n|url= http://www.detnews.com/2005/money/0509/25/B03-326006.htm |title=No Sure Cure: Critics Lambaste Book About 'Natural Cures'\n|last=Choi |first=Candice |agency=Associated Press |date=September 25, 2005 |work=AP Newswire}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}  {{cite news |title=''Natural Cures'' Book: Is It the Truth or Is It Quackery? |last=Choi |first=Candace |date=October 4, 2005 |agency=Associated Press |work=AP Newswire |url= http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/10/natural-cures-book-is-it-truth-or-is.html |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him, Trudeau \"anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory\" and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials. Trudeau's use of the word \"cure\" is an issue for regulators. Also, bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial self-published book.\n\n== Additional marketing ventures ==\n\n=== Audio tapes: \"Mega Memory\" ===\n\nTrudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the [[Blindness|blind]] and the [[mentally challenged]] to create ''Mega Memory'' and ''Advanced Mega Memory'' audio tapes. His promotion of memory-enhancing products was ended by the intervention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] which alleged that the claims made by Trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a \"[[eidetic memory|photographic memory]],\" as the advertising claimed.<ref name=\"FCCpress1998\" />\n\nTrudeau used research that Dr. Michael Van Masters conducted with the State School for the Blind in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1975 as the basis of the ''Mega Memory'' products. Trudeau was selling automobiles at Neponset Lincoln Mercury in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1982 when he first met Van Masters. Shortly after meeting Van Masters, Trudeau joined Van Masters in the memory business in Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Non-surgical facelift ===\nIn addition to ''Natural Cures'', Trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the \"Perfect Lift\" non-surgical [[facelift]].

Although he recites anecdotes, he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed [[Physician|medical practitioners]]. In instances where Trudeau has been asked to provide proof, he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies. For example, Trudeau cited a nonexistent 25-year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the [[University of Calgary]].<ref name=\"Gauntlet 2006\">{{cite web|url=http://thegauntlet.ca/story/9845|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813194647/http://thegauntlet.ca/story/9845|title=The Gauntlet\u00ae News - Firm claims diabetes cure|archivedate=13 August 2011|work=thegauntlet.ca}}</ref> When ABC News correspondent [[Jake Tapper]] confronted him on ''Nightline'', Trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it; he never did.<ref name=\"Tapper\" /> He later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry.  In 2006 University of Calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of Trudeau's claims about the university's research were true, and that its attorneys had sent Trudeau a \"cease and desist\" letter, demanding that he stop associating himself with the school.<ref name=\"Calgary Herald\"/>\n\n=== False endorsements ===\nIn August 2005, the New York Consumer Protection Board warned consumers that Trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products, noting that the back cover of ''Natural Cures'' includes false endorsements. Further, the NYCPB states that Trudeau's television advertisements \"give the false impression that [[Tammy Faye Messner]] opposes chemotherapy in favor of the 'natural cures' in Trudeau's book.\" A representative for Messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again.<ref name=\"nycpb\" />\n\nThe back cover includes the following quote from Dr. [[Herbert L. Ley, Jr.|Herbert Ley]], a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: \"The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what people think it's doing are as different as night and day.\"  The statement, extracted from a 1969 interview in ''The New York Times'', was made in the context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes.<ref name=RossNazzal>Jennifer Ross-Nazzal.

They promoted a range of products, including health aids, [[dietary supplement]]s (such as [[coral calcium]]), baldness remedies, addiction treatments, memory-improvement courses, reading-improvement programs and real estate investment strategies. The FTC took regulatory action against Trudeau, alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations. In 1998, he was fined.

According to Trudeau, the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses. Trudeau's books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop [[degenerative disease|degenerative conditions]] like [[cancer]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]], and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria, but rather by an imbalance in [[vitalism|vital energy]].

He consented to an FTC ban applying to everything except publications that the FTC concluded would infringe upon his First Amendment rights.

Trudeau says that FDA commissioners who leave the FDA to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars. In any other industry, according to Trudeau, this would be called \"bribery,\" a \"conflict of interest\" or \"payoffs.\" Trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals (such as [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] and [[aspartame]]) to get people \"addicted to food\" and to \"make people obese.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About]] |last= Trudeau |first= Kevin |year= 2005 |publisher= Alliance Publishing |isbn= 0975599518 |chapter= 5 Why We Are Sick}}</ref>\n\n=== References to scientific studies ===\nOne of the major complaints about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence that he presents in the infomercials.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Barrett, S|authorlink=Stephen Barrett| title=What 'They' Don't Want You to Know | magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=January 2006 | volume=30 | issue=1 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_lsquotheyrsquo_donrsquot_want_you_to_know | access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref>  He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, he tells a story in an infomercial about \"a friend from England\" who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of [[St. John's Wort]] compared to two prescription medications.  These studies, the infomercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation.  In an interview, he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of \"FTC suppression\"; but readers can join his web site, where, for $9.99 a month or $499 for a lifetime, they can gain access to the special members-only section from which they can e-mail him for the information.<ref name = \"wapost\"/>\n\n=== Newspaper articles ===\nA pair of 2005 [[Associated Press]] articles by Candice Choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs.<ref name=\"ChoiAP2005\">{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-28\n|url= http://www.detnews.com/2005/money/0509/25/B03-326006.htm |title=No Sure Cure: Critics Lambaste Book About 'Natural Cures'\n|last=Choi |first=Candice |agency=Associated Press |date=September 25, 2005 |work=AP Newswire}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}  {{cite news |title=''Natural Cures'' Book: Is It the Truth or Is It Quackery? |last=Choi |first=Candace |date=October 4, 2005 |agency=Associated Press |work=AP Newswire |url= http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/10/natural-cures-book-is-it-truth-or-is.html |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him, Trudeau \"anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory\" and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials. Trudeau's use of the word \"cure\" is an issue for regulators. Also, bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial self-published book.\n\n== Additional marketing ventures ==\n\n=== Audio tapes: \"Mega Memory\" ===\n\nTrudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the [[Blindness|blind]] and the [[mentally challenged]] to create ''Mega Memory'' and ''Advanced Mega Memory'' audio tapes. His promotion of memory-enhancing products was ended by the intervention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] which alleged that the claims made by Trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a \"[[eidetic memory|photographic memory]],\" as the advertising claimed.<ref name=\"FCCpress1998\" />\n\nTrudeau used research that Dr. Michael Van Masters conducted with the State School for the Blind in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1975 as the basis of the ''Mega Memory'' products. Trudeau was selling automobiles at Neponset Lincoln Mercury in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1982 when he first met Van Masters. Shortly after meeting Van Masters, Trudeau joined Van Masters in the memory business in Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Non-surgical facelift ===\nIn addition to ''Natural Cures'', Trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the \"Perfect Lift\" non-surgical [[facelift]].

Trudeau responds that by not having such training, he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the FDA, and that medical doctors \"are taught only how to write out prescriptions\" for \"poisons\" and \"cut out pieces of a person's anatomy.\"<ref name=\"Natural Cures Ch. 1\">(''Natural Cures'', Chapter 1 \u2013 \"I Should Be Dead by Now\"){{Clarify|date=November 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

Although he recites anecdotes, he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed [[Physician|medical practitioners]]. In instances where Trudeau has been asked to provide proof, he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies. For example, Trudeau cited a nonexistent 25-year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the [[University of Calgary]].<ref name=\"Gauntlet 2006\">{{cite web|url=http://thegauntlet.ca/story/9845|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813194647/http://thegauntlet.ca/story/9845|title=The Gauntlet\u00ae News - Firm claims diabetes cure|archivedate=13 August 2011|work=thegauntlet.ca}}</ref> When ABC News correspondent [[Jake Tapper]] confronted him on ''Nightline'', Trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it; he never did.<ref name=\"Tapper\" /> He later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry.  In 2006 University of Calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of Trudeau's claims about the university's research were true, and that its attorneys had sent Trudeau a \"cease and desist\" letter, demanding that he stop associating himself with the school.<ref name=\"Calgary Herald\"/>\n\n=== False endorsements ===\nIn August 2005, the New York Consumer Protection Board warned consumers that Trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products, noting that the back cover of ''Natural Cures'' includes false endorsements. Further, the NYCPB states that Trudeau's television advertisements \"give the false impression that [[Tammy Faye Messner]] opposes chemotherapy in favor of the 'natural cures' in Trudeau's book.\" A representative for Messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again.<ref name=\"nycpb\" />\n\nThe back cover includes the following quote from Dr. [[Herbert L. Ley, Jr.|Herbert Ley]], a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: \"The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what people think it's doing are as different as night and day.\"  The statement, extracted from a 1969 interview in ''The New York Times'', was made in the context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes.<ref name=RossNazzal>Jennifer Ross-Nazzal.
