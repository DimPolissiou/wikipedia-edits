Gold match at a packed Bor\u00e5s Arena against [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] where [[Joakim Sj\u00f6hage]] became gold shooter with the only goal which meant that over 40 years of waiting was over for Elfsborg's fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/guldaren2006.htm|title=Guld\u00e5ret 2006|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2561&artikel=1019813|title=Sverigesradio Elfsborg tar guld|accessdate=2012-06-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130418101802/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2561&artikel=1019813|archivedate=2013-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Average attendances==\n[[File:Algardslaktaren Bor\u00e5s Arena.jpg|thumb|Right|200px|\u00c5lg\u00e5rdsl\u00e4ktaren, in a derby against [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n !

Kasugamycin inhibits protein synthesis at the step of [[Translation (biology)|translation]] initiation. Kasugamycin inhibition is thought to occur by direct competition with initiator [[transfer RNA]]. Recent experiments suggest that kasugamycin indirectly induces dissociation of P-site-bound fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> from 30S subunits through perturbation of the [[mRNA]], thereby interfering with translation initiation.\n\nKasugamycin specifically inhibits translation initiation of canonical but not of leaderless mRNA. For initiation on leaderless mRNA, the overlap between mRNA and kasugamycin is reduced and the binding of tRNA is further stabilized by the presence of the 50S subunit, minimizing Ksg efficacy. \nKasugamycin also induces the formation of unusual 61S ribosomes in vivo, which are proficient in selectively translating leaderless mRNA. 61S particles are stable and are devoid of more than six proteins of the small subunit, including the functionally important proteins S1 and S12.\n\n==Structural basis for kasugamycin action==\nThe structure of the kasugamycin-70S ribosome complex from ''Escherichia coli'' has been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] at 3.5-A resolution. The drug binds within the messenger RNA channel of the 30S subunit between the universally conserved G926 and A794 nucleotides in 16S [[ribosomal RNA]], which are sites of kasugamycin resistance. The kasugamycin binding sites are present on top of helix 44 (h44), spanning the region between h24 and h28, which contacts the conserved nucleotides A794 and G926. Neither binding position overlaps with P-site tRNA. Instead, kasugamycin mimics the codon nucleotides at the P and E sites by binding within the path of the mRNA, thus perturbing the mRNA-tRNA codon-anticodon interaction.\n\n==Resistance==\nLow level resistance to kasugamycin is acquired by [[mutation]]s in the 16S rRNA [[methyltransferase]] KsgA which [[methylation|methylates]] the nucleotides A1518 and A1519 in 16S rRNA. Spontaneous ksgA mutations conferring a modest level of resistance to kasugamycin occur at a high frequency of 10<sup>\u22126</sup>. Once cells acquire the ksgA mutations, they produce high-level kasugamycin resistance at an extraordinarily high frequency (100-fold greater frequency than that observed in the ksgA+ strain).\n\nSurprisingly, kasugamycin resistance mutations do not inhibit binding of the drug to the ribosome. Present structural and biochemical results indicate that inhibition by kasugamycin and kasugamycin resistance are closely linked to the structure of the mRNA at the junction of the peptidyl-tRNA and exit-tRNA sites (P and E sites).\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n1.\tOkuyama, A., Machiyama, N., Kinoshita, T., and Tanaka, N.

[[Francisco Fajardo]], the son of a Spanish [[captain (land)|captain]] and a [[Guaiqueri]] ''[[cacique|cacica]]'', attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after founding a series of coastal towns. Fajardo's settlement did not last long. It was destroyed by natives of the region led by [[Terepaima]] and [[Guaicaipuro]]. This was the last rebellion on the part of the natives. On [[25 July]] 1567, Captain [[Diego de Losada]] laid the foundations of the city of ''Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas''. The foundation \u2212 1567 \u2013 \"I take possession of this land in the name of God and the King\" These were the words of Don Diego de Losada in founding the city of Caracas on 25 July 1567. In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Venezuela Province]] under Governor [[Juan de Pimentel]] (1576\u20131583).\n\nDuring the 17th century, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by [[pirate]]s. With the coastal mountains as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks. However, [[Preston Somers Expedition|in 1595]], around 200 English privateers including George Sommers and Amyas Preston crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more often-used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation.<ref>John Lombardi, ''Venezuela,'' Oxford, England, 1982, p 72.</ref><ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas|title=George Somers, Amyas Preston and the Burning of Caracas|work=The Bermudian |access-date  = 17 May 2016 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513110245/http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas |archive-date = 13 May 2016 |url-status     = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs the cocoa cultivation and exports under the [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guipuzcoana de Caracas]] grew in importance, the city expanded. In 1777, Caracas became the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Thomas 1839 000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Caracas, as painted by Joseph Thomas in 1839]]\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Manuel Gual]] led an attempted revolution aimed at independence, but the rebellion was put down on 13 July 1797. Caracas was ultimately the site of the signing of a [[Declaration of independence]] on 17 August 1811. In 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake destroyed Caracas]]. The war for independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Bol\u00edvar defeated [[royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist]]s in the [[Battle of Carabobo]].<ref name=\"HT\">Maurice Wiesenthal, ''The History and Geography of a Valley'', 1981.</ref>\n\nCaracas grew in economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In 1941, Caracas was the site at which ratifications for the [[Venezuela\u2013Colombia Boundary Treaty of 1941|L\u00f3pez de Mesa-Gil Borges Treaty]] were exchanged. Later, during the 1950s, Caracas began an intensive modernization program which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Universidad Central de Venezuela]], designed by modernist architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], was built. New working- and middle-class residential districts sprouted in the valley, extending the urban area toward the east and southeast. Joining [[El Silencio (Caracas)|El Silencio]], also designed by Villanueva, were several workers' housing districts, 23 de Enero and Simon Rodriguez. Middle-class developments include Bello Monte, Los Palos Grandes, Chuao, and El Cafetal. The dramatic change in the economic structure of the country, which went from being primarily agricultural to dependent on oil production, stimulated the fast development of Caracas, and made it a magnet for people in rural communities who migrated to the capital city in an unplanned fashion searching for greater economic opportunity. This migration created the ''rancho'' (slum) belt of the valley of Caracas.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Plan of the City of Caracas with its Division in Neighborhoods. 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|Above center you can see the [colonial] Coat of arms of Caracas, on its left a shield representing 'Justice' and on the right 'Vigilance', then a list of important colonial buildings and below a plan of the City of Caracas with its division in neighborhoods, ca. 1775, by Joseph Carlos de Aguero.

The red field symbolises the blood spilt by Caraquenian people in favour of independence and the highest ideals of the Venezuelan Nation. Later, in the year 1994, presumably as a result of the change of municipal authorities, it was decided to increase the size of the Caracas coat of arms and move it to the centre of the field. This version of the flag is still in use today.\n\nThe coat of arms of the City of Caracas was adopted by the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador Municipality]] to identify itself. Later, the [[Metropolitan Mayor Office]] assumed the lion, the scallop and [[Cross of Saint James|Saint James' Cross]] for the same purpose.\n\nThe anthem of the city is the ''[[Marcha a Caracas]]'', written by the composer [[Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis]] with the lyrics by [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia]]. The lyrics are said to be inspired by the heroism of the Caraquenian people, and the memory of the ''City of Red Roofs''. Incidentally, the [[National Anthem]] of Venezuela, ''[[Gloria al Bravo Pueblo]]'', includes the lines \"...y si el despotismo levanta la voz, seguid el ejemplo que Caracas dio\" (\"...and if despotism raises its voice, follow the example that Caracas gave\"), reflecting the fact that, in addition to generously providing many heroic fighters to the War of Independence, the junta established in Caracas (19 April 1810) served as inspiration for other regions to do the same\u2014as did its [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] a year later.\n\n==Local government==\nUnder the [[constitution of Venezuela]], municipal governments have two branches: the executive (governed by a mayor) and the legislative (managed by a [[municipal council]]).\n\n=== Metropolitan District of Caracas ===\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was [[decree]]d in ''Gaceta Official'' N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador]], [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]], [[Baruta Municipality|Baruta]], [[Sucre Municipality, Miranda|Sucre]], and [[El Hatillo Municipality, Miranda|El Hatillo]] municipalities would be delegated to the ''Alcald\u00eda Mayor'', physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldfrank|first1=Benjamin|title=Deepening Local Democracy in Latin America: Participation, Decentralization, and the Left|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-07451-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|language=en|page=190}}</ref> The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANC aprob\u00f3 supresi\u00f3n y liquidaci\u00f3n del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|accessdate=21 April 2018|publisher=El Nacional|date=20 December 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Vista PlazaVenezuela2.jpg|thumb|250px|Skyscrapers in [[Plaza Venezuela]]]]\nBusinesses that are located here include service companies, banks, and malls, among others.

Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Myriad factors contribute to the lack of tourism in Caracas. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.\n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5&nbsp;million Venezuelan bolivars.\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8&nbsp;million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6&nbsp;million bolivars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. Venezuela's current goal is to reach a GDP of 7.6 percent. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.<ref>MART\u00cdNEZ RODR\u00cdGUEZ, M. (2013).

The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, the altitude with respect to sea level varies from between {{convert|870|and|1,043|m|ft|sp=us}}, with {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the historic zone. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El \u00c1vila'', which rises to {{convert|2159|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe main body of water in Caracas is the [[Guaire River]], which flows across the city and empties into the ''[[Tuy River]]'', which is also fed by the ''El Valle'' and ''San Pedro'' rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The ''La Mariposa'' and ''Camatagua'' reservoirs provide water to the city.\nThe city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\">\nFile:Avila desde el Parque del Este 2.JPG|Day view of [[El Avila National Park]] from [[Parque del Este]]\nFile:Pueblo de Galip\u00e1n.jpg|[[:es:Galip\u00e1n|Galip\u00e1n]], town atop [[Parque Nacional El \u00c1vila|El \u00c1vila]]\nFile:Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del r\u00edo Guaire 2013 000.jpg|View of the ''Rio Guaire'' canyon, main body of water that passes through Caracas\nFile:TelefericodeCaracas.jpg|View of the [[Teleferico de Caracas|Avila gondola lift]] starting from Caracas to Hotel Humboldt station\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Este de Caracas.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|View of the east side of Caracas]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Caracas has a mix of [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') with [[subtropical highland]] (''Cwb'') influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between {{convert|900|and|1,300|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} (annual), in the city proper, and up to {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately {{convert|23.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, with the average of the coldest month (January) {{convert|22.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the average of the warmest month (July) {{convert|25.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of {{convert|2.2|C-change|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching {{convert|8|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}</span>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=61408&cityname=Caracas%2C+Venezuela&set=metric|title=Weather Base \u2013 World Weather \u2013 Average Conditions \u2013 Caracas|publisher=BBC |access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref> This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the ''Pacheco''.

[[Francisco Fajardo]], the son of a Spanish [[captain (land)|captain]] and a [[Guaiqueri]] ''[[cacique|cacica]]'', attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after founding a series of coastal towns. Fajardo's settlement did not last long. It was destroyed by natives of the region led by [[Terepaima]] and [[Guaicaipuro]]. This was the last rebellion on the part of the natives. On [[25 July]] 1567, Captain [[Diego de Losada]] laid the foundations of the city of ''Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas''. The foundation \u2212 1567 \u2013 \"I take possession of this land in the name of God and the King\" These were the words of Don Diego de Losada in founding the city of Caracas on 25 July 1567. In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Venezuela Province]] under Governor [[Juan de Pimentel]] (1576\u20131583).\n\nDuring the 17th century, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by [[pirate]]s. With the coastal mountains as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks. However, [[Preston Somers Expedition|in 1595]], around 200 English privateers including George Sommers and Amyas Preston crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more often-used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation.<ref>John Lombardi, ''Venezuela,'' Oxford, England, 1982, p 72.</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas\n |title        = George Somers, Amyas Preston and the Burning of Caracas\n |work         = The Bermudian\n |access-date  = 17 May 2016\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513110245/http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas\n |archive-date = 13 May 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the cocoa cultivation and exports under the [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guipuzcoana de Caracas]] grew in importance, the city expanded. In 1777, Caracas became the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Thomas 1839 000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Caracas, as painted by Joseph Thomas in 1839]]\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Manuel Gual]] led an attempted revolution aimed at independence, but the rebellion was put down on 13 July 1797. Caracas was ultimately the site of the signing of a [[Declaration of independence]] on 17 August 1811. In 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake destroyed Caracas]]. The war for independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Bol\u00edvar defeated [[royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist]]s in the [[Battle of Carabobo]].<ref name=\"HT\">Maurice Wiesenthal, ''The History and Geography of a Valley'', 1981.</ref>\n\nCaracas grew in economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In 1941, Caracas was the site at which ratifications for the [[Venezuela\u2013Colombia Boundary Treaty of 1941|L\u00f3pez de Mesa-Gil Borges Treaty]] were exchanged. Later, during the 1950s, Caracas began an intensive modernization program which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Universidad Central de Venezuela]], designed by modernist architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], was built. New working- and middle-class residential districts sprouted in the valley, extending the urban area toward the east and southeast. Joining [[El Silencio (Caracas)|El Silencio]], also designed by Villanueva, were several workers' housing districts, 23 de Enero and Simon Rodriguez. Middle-class developments include Bello Monte, Los Palos Grandes, Chuao, and El Cafetal. The dramatic change in the economic structure of the country, which went from being primarily agricultural to dependent on oil production, stimulated the fast development of Caracas, and made it a magnet for people in rural communities who migrated to the capital city in an unplanned fashion searching for greater economic opportunity. This migration created the ''rancho'' (slum) belt of the valley of Caracas.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Plan of the City of Caracas with its Division in Neighborhoods. 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|Above center you can see the [colonial] Coat of arms of Caracas, on its left a shield representing 'Justice' and on the right 'Vigilance', then a list of important colonial buildings and below a plan of the City of Caracas with its division in neighborhoods, ca. 1775, by Joseph Carlos de Aguero.

The red field symbolises the blood spilt by Caraquenian people in favour of independence and the highest ideals of the Venezuelan Nation. Later, in the year 1994, presumably as a result of the change of municipal authorities, it was decided to increase the size of the Caracas coat of arms and move it to the centre of the field. This version of the flag is still in use today.\n\nThe coat of arms of the City of Caracas was adopted by the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador Municipality]] to identify itself. Later, the [[Metropolitan Mayor Office]] assumed the lion, the scallop and [[Cross of Saint James|Saint James' Cross]] for the same purpose.\n\nThe anthem of the city is the ''[[Marcha a Caracas]]'', written by the composer [[Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis]] with the lyrics by [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia]]. The lyrics are said to be inspired by the heroism of the Caraquenian people, and the memory of the ''City of Red Roofs''. Incidentally, the [[National Anthem]] of Venezuela, ''[[Gloria al Bravo Pueblo]]'', includes the lines \"...y si el despotismo levanta la voz, seguid el ejemplo que Caracas dio\" (\"...and if despotism raises its voice, follow the example that Caracas gave\"), reflecting the fact that, in addition to generously providing many heroic fighters to the War of Independence, the junta established in Caracas (19 April 1810) served as inspiration for other regions to do the same\u2014as did its [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] a year later.\n\n==Local government==\nUnder the [[constitution of Venezuela]], municipal governments have two branches: the executive (governed by a mayor) and the legislative (managed by a [[municipal council]]).\n\n=== Metropolitan District of Caracas ===\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was [[decree]]d in ''Gaceta Official'' N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador]], [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]], [[Baruta Municipality|Baruta]], [[Sucre Municipality, Miranda|Sucre]], and [[El Hatillo Municipality, Miranda|El Hatillo]] municipalities would be delegated to the ''Alcald\u00eda Mayor'', physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldfrank|first1=Benjamin|title=Deepening Local Democracy in Latin America: Participation, Decentralization, and the Left|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-07451-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|language=en|page=190}}</ref> The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANC aprob\u00f3 supresi\u00f3n y liquidaci\u00f3n del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|accessdate=21 April 2018|publisher=El Nacional|date=20 December 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Vista PlazaVenezuela2.jpg|thumb|250px|Skyscrapers in [[Plaza Venezuela]]]]\nBusinesses that are located here include service companies, banks, and malls, among others.

Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Myriad factors contribute to the lack of tourism in Caracas. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.\n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5&nbsp;million Venezuelan bolivars.\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8&nbsp;million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6&nbsp;million bolivars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. Venezuela's current goal is to reach a GDP of 7.6 percent. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.<ref>MART\u00cdNEZ RODR\u00cdGUEZ, M. (2013).

The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, the altitude with respect to sea level varies from between {{convert|870|and|1,043|m|ft|sp=us}}, with {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the historic zone. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El \u00c1vila'', which rises to {{convert|2159|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe main body of water in Caracas is the [[Guaire River]], which flows across the city and empties into the ''[[Tuy River]]'', which is also fed by the ''El Valle'' and ''San Pedro'' rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The ''La Mariposa'' and ''Camatagua'' reservoirs provide water to the city.\nThe city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\">\nFile:Avila desde el Parque del Este 2.JPG|Day view of [[El Avila National Park]] from [[Parque del Este]]\nFile:Pueblo de Galip\u00e1n.jpg|[[:es:Galip\u00e1n|Galip\u00e1n]], town atop [[Parque Nacional El \u00c1vila|El \u00c1vila]]\nFile:Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del r\u00edo Guaire 2013 000.jpg|View of the ''Rio Guaire'' canyon, main body of water that passes through Caracas\nFile:TelefericodeCaracas.jpg|View of the [[Teleferico de Caracas|Avila gondola lift]] starting from Caracas to Hotel Humboldt station\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Este de Caracas.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|View of the east side of Caracas]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Caracas has a mix of [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') with [[subtropical highland]] (''Cwb'') influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between {{convert|900|and|1,300|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} (annual), in the city proper, and up to {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately {{convert|23.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, with the average of the coldest month (January) {{convert|22.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the average of the warmest month (July) {{convert|25.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of {{convert|2.2|C-change|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching {{convert|8|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}</span>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=61408&cityname=Caracas%2C+Venezuela&set=metric|title=Weather Base \u2013 World Weather \u2013 Average Conditions \u2013 Caracas |publisher=BBC |access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref> This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the ''Pacheco''.

The museum's exhibits include period [[weapons]], [[banners]] and [[uniforms]].\n\nMuch of the original colonial interior has been replaced by monumental paintings of battle scenes, but more personal [[relic]]s can be seen in the nearby [[Bolivarian Museum of Caracas|Bolivarian museum]]. The pride of the place goes to the coffin in which Bol\u00edvar's remains were brought from [[Colombia]]; his ashes now rest in the [[Pante\u00f3n Nacional|National Pantheon]].\n\n===National Pantheon===\n{{Main|National Pantheon of Venezuela}}\nVenezuela's most venerated building is five blocks north of Plaza Bol\u00edvar, on the northern edge of the old town.

It is a large urban plaza at the entrance of the Central University of Venezuela.

Here he was proclaimed ''[[Title of honor|Libertador]]'' in 1813 by the people of Caracas. The church has gilded [[baroque]] altarpieces, and retains much of its original colonial interior, despite being given a treatment in the 19th century under the auspices of [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]], which was intended to be modernizing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It contains some 17th-century masterpieces of art, carvings, sculptures and oil paintings.

The first film crew to be allowed access behind the commune walls since the cessation of the Rockbitch live performances, the documentary contains a recap of their musical career, and provides insight into their pagan/witchcraft roots with how it underpinned their music and interviews with Babe.[https://vimeo.com/220078527]\n\nAmanda and Jo subsequently went on to form the band [[Syren (band)|Syren]] with singer/songwriter Erin Bennett, who joined the Rockbitch commune in 2006.\nIn 2012, Jo died of breast cancer. Amanda gave up her musical career shortly after. Erin Bennett subsequently continued as a solo artist with a backing band that contains some ex-members of Rockbitch, discarding the name Syren and performing as Erin Bennett and the EB Band.

Amongst others, Rockbitch were the subject of a 30-minute documentary on [[BBC Choice]] the same year.<ref name=bbc /> A further, hour-long documentary was broadcast on [[Five (channel)|Channel 5]] in the UK in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/reviews/2003/05/this_is_rockbit|title=This is Rockbitch|author=Lorraine Smith|publisher=[[The F-Word (feminist blog)]]|date=2003-05-16|accessdate=2014-12-27}}</ref> Award-winning director Norman Hull made \u2018This is Rockbitch\u2019 in 2003.[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1814909/?ref_=nv_sr_1] They can still be spotted in repeats of \u2018[[Sexcetera]]\u2019.\n\nIn 2005, the entire latter-day Rockbitch lineup emerged under the name [[MT-TV (band)|MT-TV]]. This was a music-only project\u2014no sex or nudity of the Rockbitch days\u2014but it incorporated stage theatrics and provided sociosexual-based political comment through its lyrics.  After a UK tour in summer 2005, they performed throughout the United States. The first part of their US tour was documented on the DVD 'Shevolution', released by Blackwing Films in 2006. \n\nThe most recent program, released in 2017, is a Swedish documentary on the rise in popularity of witchcraft and its feminist connections. The first film crew to be allowed access behind the commune walls since the cessation of the Rockbitch live performances, the documentary contains a recap of their musical career, and provides insight into their pagan/witchcraft roots with how it underpinned their music and interviews with Babe.[https://vimeo.com/220078527]\n\nAmanda and Jo subsequently went on to form the band [[Syren (band)|Syren]] with singer/songwriter Erin Bennett, who joined the Rockbitch commune in 2006.\nIn 2012, Jo died of breast cancer. Amanda gave up her musical career shortly after. Erin Bennett subsequently continued as a solo artist with a backing band that contains some ex-members of Rockbitch, discarding the name Syren and performing as Erin Bennett and the EB Band. In the last two years, the band have undergone a complete rebranding and are now touring as a ProgRock band under the name EBB. <ref>http://www.ebbband.com/</ref>\n\nJulie, the lead singer of Rockbitch, continues her musical career under the name Krow, creating hard dance music in the style of Noise Terror Punk EDM. Her music and video were also featured in the Swedish documentary.[http://asthekrowflies.com/about]\n\n==Personnel==\n<!-- This should list the years each person was a member of the band.
