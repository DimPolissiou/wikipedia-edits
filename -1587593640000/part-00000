It is owned and operated by [[Adventist Health]], staffed by 1,879 employees, nearly 700 volunteers, 462 physicians, and 86 residents.\n\n==History==\nOn September 29, 1913, the small storefront medical clinic in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, opened its doors for the first time with the aid of the clinic's director, Dr. August Larsen. The second-hand medical instrument equipped clinic provided treatment at no cost and served as a training ground for physicians attending the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014now [[Loma Linda University]]. It was until 1915, when the talented Dr. Percy Magan serves as the new director of medical education at the clinic, leaving a prestigious teaching post and practice. A contribution of $30,000 from philanthropist Josie Phillips allows the hospital to nearly double its capacity expanding from 59 beds to 94 beds in 1922.\n\nIn 1937, the new White Memorial Medical Center building opens\u2014the first fireproof hospital in the state. The designer is noted architect [[Myron Hunt]], who also designed the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. The 1950s decade brought many expansions to WMMC, including a new wing that doubled the bed capacity of the hospital and included a radiation laboratory, electro-encephalobraphy unit, psychiatric ward and complete emergency facilities. It was during this decade that the new White Memorial Church was completed adjacent to the hospital. The opening of a $4.2 million Diagnostic and Treatment Center, now called the North Tower, became the highlight of the year 1968. In 2010, a $250 million project to rebuild the hospital became complete\u2014made possible in part by $89 million in [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) funding for seismic upgrades and $30 million in community support.\n\nToday, Adventist Health White Memorial is one of the region's leading not-for-profit hospitals. Medical services include [[behavioral medicine]], cardiac and vascular care, intensive and general medical care, oncology, orthopedic care, rehabilitation, specialized and general surgery, and women's and children's services. As a major teaching hospital, White Memorial also plays an important role in training physicians, [[nurses]] and other medical professionals. In 2012, White Memorial celebrated its 100th year of providing healthcare for its community.\n\nThe Boyle Ave location was constructed as a result of the efforts of about 50 women fundraising. On April 21, 1918, the new hospital opened in a cluster of single-story buildings as an earthquake rocks the opening ceremony attended by 2,500 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adventisthealth.org/white-memorial/about-us/history-of-caring/|title=History of Caring|website=www.adventisthealth.org}}</ref> In 1930, the [[Great Depression]] hit and White Memorial physicians accept payment from patients in flour, sugar or household goods. During this time, medical students provided janitorial work for free and nurses made home visits at no compensation. In the 1980s, White Memorial hit rock bottom, financially. Nationwide, the cost of delivering care was spiraling upward and many patients lacked health insurance or the ability to pay. The medical center was forced to eliminate programs and made difficult decisions about reducing staff. After years of belt-tightening, the hospital's future finally looked brighter. Despite the hardships, White Memorial has survived and flourished.\n\nIn 2011, [[U.S. News and World Report]] named the hospital one of the top 25 best hospitals in the Los Angeles metro area. In the same year, White Memorial won five 5-star awards from Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC) for exceeding overall quality of care. In 2012, U.S. News and World Report ranked White Memorial as a first-class facility in both the city of Los Angeles and the state of California\u2014 #12 of the 32 top rated hospitals in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and #20 of the 41 strong-performing hospitals in California. The Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC) has also recognized WMMC as a top hospital for nursing quality and success in reducing both hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and patient falls. [[HealthGrades]] awarded the hospital with 14 designations for being a \"National & State Leader in Clinical Excellence.\"\n\nThe facility is named for [[Ellen G. White]] a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who was instrumental in securing the property for [[Loma Linda Medical Center]] and [[Loma Linda University]].

During its operation, the hospital provided services to a variety of patients including [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans, children, and those declared mentally unwell. After a period of disuse the property was redeveloped by [[Ohio|the state of Ohio]]. Today, The Ridges are a part of [[Ohio University]] and house the Kennedy Museum of Art as well as an auditorium and many offices, classrooms, and storage facilities.\n\nThe former hospital is perhaps best known as a site of the infamous [[lobotomy]] procedure, as well as various supposed [[paranormal]] sightings. After the hospital's original structure closed, [[Ohio|the state of Ohio]] acquired the property and renamed the complex and its surrounding grounds The Ridges. According to The Guide of Repository Holdings,<ref>{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Doug|title=Athens Lunatic Asylum aka \"The Ridges\": A Guide to Repository Holdings|year=1993|publisher=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections|location=Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref> the term \"The Ridges\" was derived from a naming contest in 1984 to re-describe the area and its purpose.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Design and architectural features ===\nThe architect for the original building was [[Levi Scofield|Levi T. Scofield]] of Cleveland. The hospital grounds were designed by Herman Haerlin of [[Cincinnati]]. Some of Haerlin's other landscape designs are seen in Cincinnati's [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] and the Oval on the campus of [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Athens State Hospital|publisher=Division of Hygiene and Division of Hygiene and Mental Health|year=n.d.|location=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections - Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the buildings and grounds were influenced by Dr. [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]], a 19th-century physician who authored an influential treatise on hospital design called ''On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane''. [[Kirkbride Plan]] asylums are most recognizably characterized by the staggered \"bat-wing\" floor plan of their wards, [[High Victorian Gothic]] architecture, and their sprawling grounds.\n\nIn accordance with the Kirkbride Plan, the main building was to include a central administration building with a wing for men on one side and a wing for women on the other, each with their own separate dining halls. There was room to house 572 patients in the main building, almost double Kirkbride's recommendation. The main building itself was 853 feet long and 60 feet in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929175628/http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|archive-date=2017-09-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe land where the hospital was built originally belonged to the Arthur Coates and Eliakim H. Moore farms. Ground was broken on November 5, 1868. The first iteration of the asylum consisted of only {{convert|141|acre}} and over the years, grew to occupy over {{convert|1000|acre}} of land and 78 buildings.\n\n=== Operating years (1874-1993) ===\n\nAthens Lunatic Asylum began operation on January 9, 1874. Within two years of its opening, the hospital was renamed The Athens Hospital for the Insane. Later, the hospital would be called the Athens Asylum for the Insane, the Athens State Hospital, the Southeastern Ohio Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center, the Athens Mental Health and Developmental Center, and then (again) the Athens Mental Health Center. <gallery>\nImage:Ridges dayshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first day shift staff. Taken in 1873.\nImage:Ridges nightshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first night shift staff. Taken in 1873.\n</gallery>The original hospital was in operation from 1874 to 1993. Although not a wholly self-sustaining facility, many Kirkbride Plan asylums functioned as cloistered communities, and for decades the hospital had livestock, farm fields and gardens, an orchard, greenhouses, a dairy, a physical plant to generate steam heat, and even a carriage shop. A large percentage of the work it took to maintain the facility was originally carried out by patients. Labor, especially skilled labor, was seen by the Kirkbride Plan as a form of therapy and was economically advantageous for the state.\n\nThe asylum expanded to include specialized and ancillary buildings such as the [[Athens State Hospital Cow Barn|Dairy Barn]] (now an arts center), Beacon School, Athens Receiving Hospital, Center Hospital and the Tubercular Ward (\"Cottage B\"). Also built onto the main building were a laundry room and a boiler house. Seven cottages, including Cottage B, were constructed to house even more patients. While they had a smaller capacity than the main wards, they allowed for constructive grouping of patients in dormitory-like rooms.\n\nBy the 1950s the hospital was the town's largest employer, with 1,800 patients on a 1,019-acre, 78-building campus. At its peak the Athens Lunatic Asylum served Adams, Athens, Gallia, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Morgan, Perry, Pike, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington counties.\n\n=== Decline and closure ===\nThe [[Mental healthcare in the United States|mental healthcare industry in the United States]] underwent a sea change in the 1950s. Research began to show that the mentally ill did not pose an inherent danger to their communities. The public became increasingly aware of procedures like [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] and the [[lobotomy]], which would come to be seen as cruel, unnecessary and inhumane. The availability of psychoactive drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses, as well as the increasing prevalence of psychological therapy, allowed for most patients to be treated without the need for internment in a prison-like institution. The asylum, among many others, declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century and eventually closed in 1993. However, the state hospital continued to function in Athens, with some patients and staff relocating to a newly constructed facility which, at the time of the transition in 1993, was called the Southeast Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric hospital in Athens - visible from the asylum - is now named Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.\n\n== Modern history and present day ==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the early 1990s, many of the original buildings had fallen into disrepair, following a similar pattern of decline and neglect among Kirkbride Plan asylums. As the mental healthcare industry transitioned away from large, centralized institutions, the will to support sprawling hospital complexes diminished. Large asylums were slowly phased out, with most operations shifting to small outpatient centers scattered throughout the community. Because the asylums were typically located on a hill outside of the nearest municipal center, their degradation was able to occur out of sight and out of mind. Under private ownership, abandoned Kirkbrides often languished unmaintained and unsecured, slowly being reclaimed by nature, as with [[Hudson River State Hospital]] in New York. Since abandoned structures represent a serious insurance liability, there is incentive for the property owner to secure them, and abandoned property owned by colleges and universities may be especially easy targets for urban exploration, squatting, or vandalism by members of the student body or the general public.\n\nIn 1993 the Athens Lunatic Asylum's property was deeded over to [[Ohio University]] in a land swap with the state's Department of Mental Health. Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development.\n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 14-year-old girl with epilepsy,<ref>Ziff, K. K., Gladding, S. T., Bolin, S. C., & Shields, J. undefined. (2018). Asylum on the hill: history of a healing landscape. Athens: Ohio University Press.</ref> thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation.\n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons.\n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient.\n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

During its operation, the hospital provided services to a variety of patients including [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans, children, and those declared mentally unwell. After a period of disuse the property was redeveloped by [[Ohio|the state of Ohio]]. Today, The Ridges are a part of [[Ohio University]] and house the Kennedy Museum of Art as well as an auditorium and many offices, classrooms, and storage facilities.\n\nThe former hospital is perhaps best known as a site of the infamous [[lobotomy]] procedure, as well as various supposed [[paranormal]] sightings. After the hospital's original structure closed, [[Ohio|the state of Ohio]] acquired the property and renamed the complex and its surrounding grounds The Ridges. According to The Guide of Repository Holdings,<ref>{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Doug|title=Athens Lunatic Asylum aka \"The Ridges\": A Guide to Repository Holdings|year=1993|publisher=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections|location=Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref> the term \"The Ridges\" was derived from a naming contest in 1984 to re-describe the area and its purpose.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Design and architectural features ===\nThe architect for the original building was [[Levi Scofield|Levi T. Scofield]] of Cleveland. The hospital grounds were designed by Herman Haerlin of [[Cincinnati]]. Some of Haerlin's other landscape designs are seen in Cincinnati's [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] and the Oval on the campus of [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Athens State Hospital|publisher=Division of Hygiene and Division of Hygiene and Mental Health|year=n.d.|location=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections - Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the buildings and grounds were influenced by Dr. [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]], a 19th-century physician who authored an influential treatise on hospital design called ''On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane''. [[Kirkbride Plan]] asylums are most recognizably characterized by the staggered \"bat-wing\" floor plan of their wards, [[High Victorian Gothic]] architecture, and their sprawling grounds. \n\nIn accordance with the Kirkbride Plan, the main building was to include a central administration building with a wing for men on one side and a wing for women on the other, each with their own separate dining halls. There was room to house 572 patients in the main building, almost double Kirkbride's recommendation. The main building itself was 853 feet long and 60 feet in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929175628/http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|archive-date=2017-09-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\n=== Construction ===\nThe land where the hospital was built originally belonged to the Arthur Coates and Eliakim H. Moore farms. Ground was broken on November 5, 1868. The first iteration of the asylum consisted of only {{convert|141|acre}} and over the years, grew to occupy over {{convert|1000|acre}} of land and 78 buildings.\n\n=== Operating years (1874-1993) ===\n\nAthens Lunatic Asylum began operation on January 9, 1874. Within two years of its opening, the hospital was renamed The Athens Hospital for the Insane. Later, the hospital would be called the Athens Asylum for the Insane, the Athens State Hospital, the Southeastern Ohio Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center, the Athens Mental Health and Developmental Center, and then (again) the Athens Mental Health Center. <gallery>\nImage:Ridges dayshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first day shift staff. Taken in 1873.\nImage:Ridges nightshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first night shift staff. Taken in 1873.\n</gallery>The original hospital was in operation from 1874 to 1993. Although not a wholly self-sustaining facility, many Kirkbride Plan asylums functioned as cloistered communities, and for decades the hospital had livestock, farm fields and gardens, an orchard, greenhouses, a dairy, a physical plant to generate steam heat, and even a carriage shop. A large percentage of the work it took to maintain the facility was originally carried out by patients. Labor, especially skilled labor, was seen by the Kirkbride Plan as a form of therapy and was economically advantageous for the state.\n\nThe asylum expanded to include specialized and ancillary buildings such as the [[Athens State Hospital Cow Barn|Dairy Barn]] (now an arts center), Beacon School, Athens Receiving Hospital, Center Hospital and the Tubercular Ward (\"Cottage B\"). Also built onto the main building were a laundry room and a boiler house. Seven cottages, including Cottage B, were constructed to house even more patients. While they had a smaller capacity than the main wards, they allowed for constructive grouping of patients in dormitory-like rooms. \n\nBy the 1950s the hospital was the town's largest employer, with 1,800 patients on a 1,019-acre, 78-building campus. At its peak the Athens Lunatic Asylum served Adams, Athens, Gallia, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Morgan, Perry, Pike, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington counties. \n\n=== Decline and closure ===\nThe [[Mental healthcare in the United States|mental healthcare industry in the United States]] underwent a sea change in the 1950s. Research began to show that the mentally ill did not pose an inherent danger to their communities. The public became increasingly aware of procedures like [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] and the [[lobotomy]], which would come to be seen as cruel, unnecessary and inhumane. The availability of psychoactive drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses, as well as the increasing prevalence of psychological therapy, allowed for most patients to be treated without the need for internment in a prison-like institution. The asylum, among many others, declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century and eventually closed in 1993. However, the state hospital continued to function in Athens, with some patients and staff relocating to a newly constructed facility which, at the time of the transition in 1993, was called the Southeast Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric hospital in Athens - visible from the asylum - is now named Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.\n\n== Modern history and present day ==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the early 1990s, many of the original buildings had fallen into disrepair, following a similar pattern of decline and neglect among Kirkbride Plan asylums. As the mental healthcare industry transitioned away from large, centralized institutions, the will to support sprawling hospital complexes diminished. Large asylums were slowly phased out, with most operations shifting to small outpatient centers scattered throughout the community. Because the asylums were typically located on a hill outside of the nearest municipal center, their degradation was able to occur out of sight and out of mind. Under private ownership, abandoned Kirkbrides often languished unmaintained and unsecured, slowly being reclaimed by nature, as with [[Hudson River State Hospital]] in New York. Since abandoned structures represent a serious insurance liability, there is incentive for the property owner to secure them, and abandoned property owned by colleges and universities may be especially easy targets for urban exploration, squatting, or vandalism by members of the student body or the general public.\n\nIn 1993 the Athens Lunatic Asylum's property was deeded over to [[Ohio University]] in a land swap with the state's Department of Mental Health. Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development. \n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 14-year-old girl with epilepsy <ref>Ziff, K. K., Gladding, S. T., Bolin, S. C., & Shields, J. undefined. (2018). Asylum on the hill: history of a healing landscape. Athens: Ohio University Press.</ref>, thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation. \n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons. \n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient.\n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

DSH police officers are not affiliated with California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). The police officers of the Department of State Hospitals are peace officers whose authority extends to any place in the state for the purpose of performing their primary duty or when making an arrest pursuant to Section 836 as to any public offense with respect to which there is immediate danger to person or property, or of the escape of the perpetrator of that offense, or pursuant to Section 8597 or 8598 of the Government Code provided that the primary duty of the peace officers shall be the enforcement of the law as set forth in Sections 4311, 4313, 4491, and 4493 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. DSH police officers are granted authority by the California Welfare and Institutions Code to enforce policies and directives set forth by the administration of Department of State Hospitals.\n\nDSH police officers enforce the [[California Penal Code]], as well as the [[California Vehicle Code]], and are granted authority by the State of California to make [[Arrest#United States|arrests]] and issue [[Summons#Citation/Claim (legal term)|citations]]. It is the primary function of the Department of State Hospitals' police officers to provide safety, service, and security to patients, employees and the public in and around each hospital. However, this police department does assist neighboring law enforcement agencies with police activities and functions, off-site of the grounds of DSHA. In addition to police responsibilities and investigations, police officers work closely with clinical staff to ensure the safe treatment of the patients of DSHA.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] is institutionalized at \"Pescadero State Hospital\" - {{citation needed span|text=a mental institute heavily based on Atascadero State Hospital|date=October 2016}}.\n\nOne of radio host [[Phil Hendrie]]'s recurring fictional characters is Herb Sewell, a former sex offender who was remanded for eight years at Atascadero State Hospital.\n\nIt also is referred to in the film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' as the place where \"Cole\" is sent after his mental breakdown.\n\nIn James Ellroy's ''The Black Dahlia'' (1987), set in the late 1940s, there are several anachronistic references to characters having been committed to Atascadero State Hospital \u2013 which did not open until 1954.

DSH police officers are not affiliated with California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). The police officers of the Department of State Hospitals are peace officers whose authority extends to any place in the state for the purpose of performing their primary duty or when making an arrest pursuant to Section 836 as to any public offense with respect to which there is immediate danger to person or property, or of the escape of the perpetrator of that offense, or pursuant to Section 8597 or 8598 of the Government Code provided that the primary duty of the peace officers shall be the enforcement of the law as set forth in Sections 4311, 4313, 4491, and 4493 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. DSH police officers are granted authority by the California Welfare and Institutions Code to enforce policies and directives set forth by the administration of Department of State Hospitals.\n\nDSH police officers enforce the [[California Penal Code]], as well as the [[California Vehicle Code]], and are granted authority by the State of California to make [[Arrest#United States|arrests]] and issue [[Summons#Citation/Claim (legal term)|citations]]. It is the primary function of the Department of State Hospitals' police officers to provide safety, service, and security to patients, employees and the public in and around each hospital. However, this police department does assist neighboring law enforcement agencies with police activities and functions, off-site of the grounds of DSHA. In addition to police responsibilities and investigations, police officers work closely with clinical staff to ensure the safe treatment of the patients of DSHA.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] is institutionalized at \"Pescadero State Hospital\" - {{citation needed span|text=a mental institute heavily based on Atascadero State Hospital|date=October 2016}}.\n\nOne of radio host [[Phil Hendrie]]'s recurring fictional characters is Herb Sewell, a former sex offender who was remanded for eight years at Atascadero State Hospital.\n\nIt also is referred to in the film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' as the place where \"Cole\" is sent after his mental breakdown.\n\nIn James Ellroy's ''The Black Dahlia'' (1987), set in the late 1940s, there are several anachronistic references to characters having been committed to Atascadero State Hospital \u2013 which did not open until 1954.

In 1994, St. Elizabeth Medical Center became Providence Yakima Medical Center, and in 2003 the name was changed to '''Yakima Regional Medical and Cardiac Center'''. In 2017, the hospital joined a healthcare system called Astria Health and was renamed Astria Regional Medical Center.

The hospital cared for 37 patients the first year, and within a year the hospital moved to a larger building to keep up with the capacity.\n\nSt. Elizabeth's grew from performing their first surgery on a kitchen table in the 1890s to opening the first [[coronary care unit]] in the state in the 1960s and the region's first comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation facility in the 1980s. In 1994, St. Elizabeth Medical Center became Providence Yakima Medical Center, and in 2003 the name was changed to '''Yakima Regional Medical and Cardiac Center'''. In 2017, the hospital joined a healthcare system called Astria Health and was renamed Astria Regional Medical Center. The cardiac services were expanded and within the hospital, the expert cardiology staff, state of the art facilities and cardiac programs were renamed Astria Heart Institute.\n\nAccredited by the [[Joint Commission]].<ref name=\"qualitycheck\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qualitycheck.org/consumer/searchResults.aspx?ddstatelist2=WA&ddcitylist=38769&st_cd=&st=WA&st_nm=WASHINGTON&cty_nm=Yakima&cty_id=38769&provGrpId=2&provGrpIdtracker=2 |title=Quality Check - Consumer Search - Results |publisher=qualitycheck.org |accessdate=April 6, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAstria Health, which runs hospitals in Yakima, Toppenish and Sunnyside and a family of clinics throughout the Yakima Valley, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/astria/astria-health-continues-reorganization-process-with-court-approval/article_a2074c8f-631c-5e65-bb8d-2dd8e1e7c2c1.html|title=Astria Health continues reorganization process with court approval|last=Herald-Republic|first=MAI HOANG Yakima|website=Yakima Herald-Republic|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAstria Regional Medical Center closed January 13, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/astria/astria-regional-medical-center-in-yakima-to-close/article_c14d1e9e-2288-54de-88e7-109e45fab6c5.html|title=Astria Regional Medical Center in Yakima to close|last=Herald-Republic|first=MAI HOANG Yakima|website=Yakima Herald-Republic|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n==Current Times==\nThe state of Washington entered into an agreement to lease Astria Regional Medical Center as a temporary field hospital to support the state of Washington during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Ten years later, the Medford Clinic was purchased by Memorial Hospital of Taylor County.\n\nCompleted in September 1968, was the addition of a second floor to the north, south, and west wings of the hospital, increasing its bed count by 60. The $848,198.04 addition also included the expansion of the laboratory and X-ray departments, and the construction of a coronary care unit, a physical therapy area, a boiler room, and garage.\n\nIn October 1975, Memorial Hospital\u2019s critical care unit was completed.\n\nIn 1978 a 68-bed nursing home was attached to the hospital. Only private pay residents were admitted to the facility prior to its becoming Medicare certified in 1998.\n\nIn June 1983, an ultrasound machine was added to Memorial\u2019s services. In-house mammography and CT scans made their debut in 1984 and 1993 respectively. Digital mammography, mobile PET/CT and breast MRIs were introduced in 2008.\n\nIn August 1984, Cedar Court Apartments, a 24-unit senior low-income housing complex was established.\n\n===Continuing growth===\nIn April 1990, Memorial Hospital and Community Health Care, Inc., the parent organization of Wausau Hospital, became affiliated. This provided access to more specialists, technology, cost-effective purchasing, and more active physician recruitment. Ownership and control of Memorial Hospital of Taylor County remained local, and the hospital continued to be a community, not-for-profit entity.\n\nIn February 1991, a new three-phase cardiac rehabilitation program began.\n\nMemorial Hospital of Taylor County (Medford), Good Samaritan Health Center (Merrill), Langlade Memorial Hospital (Antigo) and Wausau Hospital created the Wisconsin Valley Health Network, a not-for-profit health care corporation in June 1996.\n\n===Memorial Health Center===\nIn 1999, Memorial Hospital of Taylor County changed its name to Memorial Health Center.\n\nIn June 2000, Country Gardens - a residential care 28-unit apartment complex (RCAC), was opened.\n\nAugust 2000, Memorial Health Center opened a walk-in clinic under the direction of the hospital\u2019s emergency department.\n\nBy March 2001, the clinics, hospital, and nursing home officially became one organization.

When construction was completed in 2006, the facility had grown by 80 percent - three surgical suites, private patient rooms, rooms designed for chemotherapy services, a new emergency department, and a new two-story clinic were the highlights.\n\nThe addition moved Memorial\u2019s Medford Therapy and Fitness to the vacated adjacent clinic building. It provided the therapy department with an additional {{convert|5000|sqft|m2}}, which was renovated into private therapeutic patient treatment rooms, a physical therapy gym, and public fitness center.\n\nIn 2005, Memorial Health Center was categorized as a [[Level III Trauma]] Care Facility,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncrules.state.nc.us/ncac/title%2010a%20-%20health%20and%20human%20services/chapter%2013%20-%20nc%20medical%20care%20commission/subchapter%20p/10a%20ncac%2013p%20.0903.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722003148/http://ncrules.state.nc.us/ncac/title%2010a%20-%20health%20and%20human%20services/chapter%2013%20-%20nc%20medical%20care%20commission/subchapter%20p/10a%20ncac%2013p%20.0903.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}</ref> which is a standard above most other critical access hospitals.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn August 2008, Memorial offered expectant parents a new option in childbirth -- [[water birth]]s.
