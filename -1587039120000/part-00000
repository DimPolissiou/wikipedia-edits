Taylor & Francis, London, UK.</ref> In the north west, these sedimentary rocks largely consist of [[Tertiary]] and [[Cretaceous]] rocks of the Sokoto Basin (the south eastern part of the [[Iullemmeden Basin]]), which are made up of varying amounts of [[sandstone]] and [[clay]], with lesser amounts of [[limestone]]. In the north east, Tertiary and [[Quaternary]] rocks of the [[Chad Basin]] comprise sandstone, siltstone and shale. In the centre of Nigeria, along the course of the [[Benue River|Benue]] and [[Niger river]]s, are Tertiary and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Benue and Nupe Basins. The Benue Basin consists of continental sandstones overlain by marine and estuarine shales and limestones, while the Nupe Basin largely contains continental sandstones, siltstones, claystones and conglomerates.\n\nAlong the coast, within the [[Niger Delta]] Basin, there are significant unconsolidated sediments of Tertiary to Quaternary age, comprising coarse to medium grained unconsolidated sands and gravels with thin peats, silts, clays and shales.\n\n[[File: Nigeria_Hydrogeology3.png|thumb|Hydrogeology of Nigeria at 1:5 Million Scale]]\n\n===Basement Aquifers===\nThe basement rocks generally form low to moderate productivity aquifers where groundwater flow is concentrated in fractures, and often in a weathered mantle, which can develop in the upper few to tens of metres. Boreholes within basement aquifers are typically drilled to depths of 10\u201370 m, depending on local conditions. Water quality in these aquifers is generally good.<ref name=\"AGA\"/>\n\n===Sedimentary Aquifers===\nRocks in the lower, more southerly part, of the Benue Basin form moderately productive aquifers where groundwater flow is concentrated in fractures. Borehole yields typically vary from 2 to 8 litres per second (l/s), but can be much higher or lower than this depending on the degree of fracturing and weathering. Aquifers tend to be localised and unconfined, with boreholes ranging from 40 to 150 m deep. Groundwater from these aquifers can be highly mineralised.<ref name=\"AGA\"/>\n\nRocks in the Upper Benue Basin typically form low to moderate productivity aquifers, with borehole yields varying between 1 and 5 l/s. Groundwater flow is largely intergranular and boreholes can vary in depth from 30 to 300 m. Groundwater quality is generally good.<ref name=\"AGA\"/>\n\nRocks in the Nupe Basin form low to moderately productive aquifers. Groundwater flow predominantly occurs through pore spaces in the rocks, which are generally fine grained and slightly cemented, limiting groundwater potential. Where coarser sandstones dominate, yields of 2 to 4 l/s can be achieved; basal conglomerate beds may support higher yields.<ref name=\"Offodile\"/>\n\nBorehole yields in rocks of the Sokoto Basin are highly variable, but can be moderate to highly productive where coarser sandstones dominate. Lower sandstones can be confined while upper sandstone layers are typically unconfined.\n\nThe Chad Formation, found in the Chad Basin, forms a moderate to highly productive aquifer, with yields up to 30 l/s recorded. Groundwater flow is largely intergranular and aquifers can be unconfined or confined depending on local conditions. Deeper sandstone layers are often confined. The Gombe Formation, also in the Chad Basin, has much lower permeability providing yields of around 1 to 5 l/s. Natural water quality from both these formations is generally good.\n\n===Igneous Aquifers===\nVolcanic rocks also occur in Nigeria, forming low to moderately productive aquifers. Borehole yields are typically less than 3 l/s and may be drilled to depths of around 15 to 50 m.\n\n===Unconsolidated Aquifers===\nUnconsolidated rocks, which predominantly occur in the coastal Niger Delta Basin and along major river valleys, form high to very high productivity aquifers. Alluvial aquifers are largely unconfined with shallow water tables and are thickest (15 \u2013 30 m) along the rivers Niger and Benue.\n\nIn the Niger Delta Basin, the upper Deltaic Formation is unconsolidated and largely unconfined with a shallow water table (0\u201310 m below ground level).<ref name=\"Offodile\">Offodile ME (2002). Groundwater study and development in Nigeria. Mecon Services Ltd, Jos, Nigeria.</ref> The older Benin Formation is partly consolidated. It is largely unconfined (locally confined by lower permeability beds) with a water table typically between 3 and 15 m below ground level, but can be as much as 55 m deep.<ref name=\"Offodile\"/> Aquifers in the Niger Delta Basin can provide yields from 3 to 60 l/s with borehole depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. Recharge is mostly directly from rainfall. Water quality issues include salinity, due to intrusion of sea water, iron, and pollution from human activities, particularly in urban areas.\n\n==Groundwater Issues==\n===Groundwater Availability===\nA 1996 survey by the Ministry of Water Resources found only 63% of boreholes in Nigeria were in working order, with many out of action due to pump failure.<ref name=\"JICA\"/>\n\nThere are local issues of over-abstraction of groundwater, causing lowering of groundwater levels and, in some cases, land [[subsidence]]. These are mainly in unconsolidated aquifers in urban areas in the coastal plain in the south, including in Lagos and Port Harcourt.<ref name=\"MoWR\"/>\n\nThere are issues with drought causing lowering of groundwater levels, both seasonally in dry seasons, and during longer-term periods of low rainfall. This is particularly an issue for local, low storage basement aquifers, both in the north where rainfall is low and in the south, where rainfall is high.<ref name=\"MoWR\"/> The potential impact of climate change on groundwater levels, combined with changing water demand, is recognised in the National Water Resources Master Plan.<ref name=\"MoWR\"/>\n\n===Groundwater Quality===\nGroundwater pollution related to human activities (agriculture, domestic waste, industry) are issues in shallow aquifers, particularly permeable unconsolidated deposits, which have little protection from surface activities. Natural groundwater quality issues have also been recorded. Examples of this include high [[salinity]] in shallow alluvial aquifers due to dissolution of evaporate minerals and high [[iron]] and [[manganese]] concentrations in confined aquifers with low [[oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (i.e. [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]]).<ref>[https://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/browse.cfm?sec=9&cat=115 British Geological Survey & WaterAid. 2003.

Through membership of the Hydrology and Hydrogeology Subcommittee of the National Technical Committee on Water Resources (NTCWR), the technical arm of the National Council of Water Resources (NCWR), the NAH contributes to the development of water resources policies and legislation, including the Water Resources Act 100 and the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality.\n\nThe Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), an agency of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, has responsibility for groundwater monitoring. There is a national groundwater level monitoring programme with 43 monitoring points, 32 of which are equipped with data loggers. These are sited in basement and sedimentary aquifers. The frequency of monitoring at sites with data loggers is daily, and sometimes twice daily.\n\nNIHSA has implemented a programme of drilling new monitoring boreholes for monitoring groundwater level. The new boreholes so far are focussed on sedimentary aquifers used for urban water supply; with borehole depths of 80 to 100 m.<ref name=\"MoWR\"/> The groundwater level monitoring data are stored at NIHSA headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe NIHSA is also responsible for water quality monitoring, but as yet a full programme is not in place due to lack of equipment.\n\nThe National Water Resources Master Plan recognises current problems in the effective acquisition and management of groundwater data, and recommends strategies for improving this situation.<ref name=\"MoWR\"/>\n\n==Sources==\n:{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Africa Groundwater Atlas: Hydrogeology of Nigeria\n| author = Tijani M, Crane E, Upton K, O Dochartaigh BE\n| publisher = British Geological Survey\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Nigeria\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC-BY-SA 3.0\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* https://www.bgs.ac.uk/africagroundwateratlas/index.cfm\n* http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Nigeria\n\n[[Category:Hydrogeology]]\n[[Category:Water in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Geology of Nigeria]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n'''[[Groundwater]] in [[Nigeria]]''' is widely used for domestic, agricultural, and industrial supplies.
