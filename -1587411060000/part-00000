It was released on April 29, 2011 by [[Island Records]]. Produced during the pregnancy of her twins Emme and Max, ''Love?'' was cited by Lopez as her most personal album to date, taking inspiration from the birth of her twins and her own experiences with love. Recording for the album began in 2009, with an original release date for the project set for January 2010 by [[Epic Records]] to coincide with Lopez's film ''[[The Back-up Plan]]''. However following the lack of success with lead single \"[[Louboutins (song)|Louboutins]]\", Lopez and Epic Records parted ways, leaving the fate of ''Love?'' in uncertainty. In 2010, Lopez signed a new record deal with Island Records, allowing proceedings for the release to be kept. The album includes a mixture of previously recorded material which leaked online in 2009 and 2010 during recording sessions, along with new songs with [[Tricky Stewart]], [[The-Dream]] and [[RedOne]] commissioned by Island Records, primarily a [[dance-pop]]<ref name=\"Markovitz\"/>  album, ''Love?'' also marks a return to Lopez's [[pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140726185009/http://m.stylist.co.uk/people/jennifer-lopez-back-to-her-roots |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-26 |title=Jennifer Lopez: Back to her Roots - People - Stylist Magazine |publisher=M.stylist.co.uk |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Love?'' garnered mixed reviews from music critics. While some were critical of it, others disagreed, praising it as a great dance album. Commercially, ''Love?'' debuted at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming her sixth album to peak within the top 10 in the United States, and her highest peak since 2005's ''[[Rebirth (Jennifer Lopez album)|Rebirth]]''. Internationally, ''Love?'' experienced moderate success, peaking within the top 10 in twenty-four different countries and also reaching the top five of several music markets. The album sold 346,000 copies in the United States.\n\nThe album's first single under Island Records is \"[[On the Floor]]\" and features [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]]. It reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped over thirty international charts, while the second and third singles from ''Love?'', being \"[[I'm Into You]]\" featuring rapper [[Lil Wayne]] and \"[[Papi (song)|Papi]]\", both topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], each becoming moderate hits. ''Love?'' has become her third consecutive album to have all singles reach number one on that chart, earning her a milestone for eleven number ones at the time tying her with [[Katy Perry]] and [[Kristine W]].\n\n== Background ==\n''Love?'' follows the footsteps of her least commercially successful album, ''[[Brave (Jennifer Lopez album)|Brave]]'' (2007), which just missed the top ten of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], at position 12.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |title=Jennifer Lopez goes up against Britney Spears with new album |publisher=Allheadlinenews.com (AHN) / (CNS) |last=Jones |first=Anthony |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113435/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90034494?Jennifer%20Lopez%20goes%20up%20against%20Britney%20Spears%20with%20new%20album |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Its beginnings date from late 2007 and early 2008, during Lopez's pregnancy with twins Emme and Max.
