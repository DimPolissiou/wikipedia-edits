It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

These are the tests of \u201cnature and consequences\u201d, \u201cmorality\u201d, \u201cnature of the conduct\u201d, \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d, \u201cevidence of mental disability\u201d, and \u201cjudgment\u201d. 49 American states use one of these six tests in reviewing cases of sexual abuse, with the exception of [[Illinois]] (which uses two tests).<ref name=morano />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the penal code, a person is defined as mentally defective if they suffer from \"a mental disease or defect which renders him or her incapable of appraising the nature of his or her conduct.\" The special protection granted to those with intellectual disabilities in these cases is akin to the statutory protection given to children.

He also starred at [[Georgetown University]] where he is a member of the Georgetown University Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nAt Georgetown, Floyd excelled all four seasons, leading the team in scoring in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and was team Captain in 1981 and 1982. Floyd was named an All-[[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] selection in 1980, 1981, 1982, and an All-America in 1981 and 1982.

[[basketball]] player.\n\n==Basketball career==\nBorn in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], Floyd received the nickname \"Sleepy\" playing baseball in the fourth grade, when a spectator yelled \"Get that kid out of the game. He\u2019s sleeping.\"<ref>[http://www.nba.com/warriors/catching_up_floyd.html Catching up with Sleepy Floyd] ''NBA.com''</ref> A 6'3\" guard, Floyd played competitively at [[Hunter Huss High School]] in Gastonia.  During Floyd's junior season at Hunter Huss High, he led his team to win in the 1977 North Carolina state basketball championship over rival Ashbrook High, a team led by [[James Worthy]].  He also starred at [[Georgetown University]] where he is a member of the Georgetown University Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nAt Georgetown, Floyd excelled all four seasons, leading the team in scoring in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and was team Captain in 1981 and 1982. Floyd was named an All-Big East selection in 1980, 1981, 1982, and an All-America in 1981 and 1982. Georgetown's leading scorer in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982, Floyd still holds the Georgetown record for Career Points, #1 (2,304)<ref>{{Cite web|title = Georgetown Basketball History Project: Top 100 Players|url = http://www.hoyabasketball.com/features/top100/e_floyd.htm|website = www.hoyabasketball.com|accessdate = September 16, 2015}}</ref> a record that has stood for thirty-seven years.\n\nFloyd was drafted by the [[New Jersey Nets]] with the 13th pick of the [[1982 NBA draft]].  During the middle of an unspectacular rookie season, Floyd was traded by the Nets with [[Mickey Johnson]] to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for [[Micheal Ray Richardson]].  Floyd quickly blossomed while playing for the Warriors, averaging 16.8 points per game in his first full season with the franchise, and during the [[1984\u201385 NBA season]], he averaged a career high 19.5 points per game. Two seasons later, he averaged 18.8 points and 10.3 assists and earned a spot on the [[1986-87 NBA season|1987]] [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Team]].\n\nIn December 1987, Floyd was traded with [[Joe Barry Carroll]] to the [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Ralph Sampson]] and [[Steve Harris (basketball)|Steve Harris]], and Floyd would play 5\u00bd seasons with the Rockets before signing as a free agent with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in [[1992-93 NBA season|1993]], a year before the Rockets would win their 2 consecutive championships. After one season in San Antonio, he returned to the [[New Jersey Nets]], and he retired in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1995]] with 12,260 career points and 5,175 career assists.\n\nFloyd still holds the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in half (39), in Game 4 of the 1987 Western Conference Semifinals against the [[1986\u201387 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]]. Floyd scored 12 consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 51 points, and prevented a sweep of the Warriors by in-state rival Lakers.\n\n==Post career==\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Floyd ran a restaurant for three years, and started a financial management company. In 2004-2005, he coached junior varsity boys' basketball at Gaston Day School, located in his hometown of Gastonia, NC.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/WHERE-ARE-THEY-NOW-Eric-Sleepy-Floyd-2897034.php WHERE ARE THEY NOW? / Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd / Ex-Warrior's next venture -- coaching] by Mark Fainaru-Wada, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', July 22, 2001.
