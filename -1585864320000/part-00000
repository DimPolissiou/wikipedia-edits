This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system.  The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.  By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.\n\nOn 1 February, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] instructed the municipal and prefectural governments to establish specialized COVID-19 consultation centres and outpatient wards at their local public health facilities by the first half of the month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20200203/k00/00m/040/227000c|title=\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u300c\u5e30\u56fd\u8005\u30fb\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u76f8\u8ac7\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3078 \u5c02\u9580\u5916\u6765\u3078\u306e\u53d7\u8a3a\u3092\u4fc3\u3059|last=|first=|date=2020-02-03|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Mainichi)|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>  Such wards would provide medical examinations and testing for suspected carriers of the disease to protect general hospitals from infection.\n\nOn 5 February, PM Abe announced during the Fifth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would begin preparations to strengthen COVID-19 testing capabilities at the NIID and 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that are designated by the government as official testing sites.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease.

He also appears in the [[prequel]], ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009690/ Leland Palmer (character) on IMDb]</ref>\n\nLeland (played by [[Ray Wise]]) is an [[Lawyer|attorney]], with his primary client being local businessman [[Benjamin Horne|Ben Horne]]. He is well-known and respected in the town of Twin Peaks. Together with his wife [[Sarah Palmer (Twin Peaks)|Sarah]] and his daughter [[Laura Palmer|Laura]], his family seems to be perfect. When Laura is murdered, however, Leland's psychological foundations begin to crumble, and it is gradually revealed that extreme dysfunction, including [[incest]], lies beneath the Palmer family's idyllic surface.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Twin Peaks''===\nIn the [[Pilot (Twin Peaks)|pilot episode]] of the series, Leland is called into the morgue to identify Laura's body. The grief pushes him over the edge; he throws himself into the grave at Laura's funeral and has to be dragged out, and for the next few weeks he manically asks people - even complete strangers - to dance with him as Laura had, all while sobbing hysterically.\n\nWhen [[Jacques Renault]] is arrested as a suspect in Laura's murder, Leland murders him by suffocating him with a pillow. After killing Jacques, Leland's hair turns white overnight. Leland is arrested, but released on a personal recognizance bond pending trial due to personal assurances made by [[Sheriff]] [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] that he does not pose any danger to the community. Leland's behavior at times appears abnormal - manically happy at times, exhibited by singing the 1940s popular nonsense song \"[[Mairzy Doats]]\", before crashing into grief. The arrival of his niece-in-law<ref name=\"secrethistoryoftwinpeaks\" /> [[Maddy Ferguson|Madeline \"Maddy\" Ferguson]], who looks almost exactly like Laura (both roles are played by [[Sheryl Lee]]), is of great help to him in learning how to deal with his daughter's death.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that, as a boy, Leland met a strange neighbor who turned out to be a [[demon]]ic entity named [[Killer BOB|BOB]], who would possess him throughout his life. It is also implied that BOB [[child molestation|molested]] him as a child. It is difficult to tell when and if Leland is truly in control of himself and when he is being possessed by BOB. It is implied that Leland killed Jacques Renault on his own &ndash; not under BOB's control &ndash; and that Leland is lost from that point: he is no longer able to stop BOB and is completely taken over, physically manifested by the change of hair color and a dramatic change in behavior. Finally, BOB takes control of Leland and murders Maddy. The changes in Leland from this point help Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]] to finally identify him as BOB's \"host\".\n\nLeland is eventually exposed as the murderer of both his daughter and his niece Maddy and is arrested by Cooper and Truman. He later dies in custody following a bizarre interrogation on the night of his arrest. BOB takes control of Leland and forces him to run headfirst into the metal door of an interrogation room. At the moment of his death, Leland remembers the crimes he committed under BOB's control, and cries out in agony. After Cooper recites the last rites from the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', Leland sees a vision of his daughter Laura and dies. Later on, Cooper explains to the widowed Sarah that he believes the vision was of Laura forgiving Leland and welcoming him into the [[afterlife]].\n\nIn the [[Beyond Life and Death|final episode of the series]], Cooper encounters a grinning [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Leland in the [[Black Lodge]], who says \"I did not kill anybody.\"\n\n===''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me''===\nThe prequel film ''Fire Walk With Me'', which depicts the last week of Laura's life, reveals that Bob had begun raping her when she was 12 years old while possessing Leland. The abuse drives Laura into a life of drug addiction and promiscuity, and she begins working as a [[call girl]]. She often turns tricks together with Theresa Banks - whom Leland frequently visits while away on business. He arranges a \"party\" with Banks and two other girls, only to find out that the two girls are Laura and her friend [[Ronette Pulaski]]. He pays Banks and leaves, but comes back later that night and beats her to death.\n\nA year later, he sees Laura having [[group sex]] with Pulaski, Renault and [[Leo Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Leo Johnson]]; enraged, BOB uses Leland to attack, beat and rape both girls, before killing Laura, even as Leland begs BOB not to make him do it. He wraps Laura's body in plastic and dumps it in a river. He then appears in the [[Black Lodge]], where he meets [[The Man From Another Place]] and [[MIKE]], BOB's former partner in murder.\n\n===Series relaunch===\nWhen ''Twin Peaks'' was revived in 2017, [[Ray Wise]] confirmed that he would appear in the new series, once again portraying Leland Palmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/twin-peaks-revival-release-date-david-lynch-directing-episodes-1201709267/|work=[[IndieWire]]|title=\u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Revival: Release Info Revealed & David Lynch Directing All 18 Episodes|author=Calvario, Liz|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}</ref> In the second episode of the renewed series, Leland appears in the Black Lodge imploring Cooper to \"find Laura\".

Later on, Cooper explains to the widowed Sarah that he believes the vision was of Laura forgiving Leland and welcoming him into the [[afterlife]].\n\nIn the [[Beyond Life and Death|final episode of the series]], Cooper encounters a grinning [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Leland in the [[Black Lodge]], who says \"I did not kill anybody.\"\n\n===''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me''===\nThe prequel film ''Fire Walk With Me'', which depicts the last week of Laura's life, reveals that Bob had begun raping her when she was 12 years old while possessing Leland. The abuse drives Laura into a life of drug addiction and promiscuity, and she begins working as a [[call girl]]. She often turns tricks together with Theresa Banks - whom Leland frequently visits while away on business. He arranges a \"party\" with Banks and two other girls, only to find out that the two girls are Laura and her friend [[Ronette Pulaski]]. He pays Banks and leaves, but comes back later that night and beats her to death.\n\nA year later, he sees Laura having [[group sex]] with Pulaski, Renault and [[Leo Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Leo Johnson]]; enraged, BOB uses Leland to attack, beat and rape both girls, before killing Laura, even as Leland begs BOB not to make him do it. He wraps Laura's body in plastic and dumps it in a river. He then appears in the [[Black Lodge]], where he meets [[The Man From Another Place]] and [[MIKE]], BOB's former partner in murder.\n\n===Series relaunch===\nWhen ''Twin Peaks'' was revived in 2017, [[Ray Wise]] confirmed that he would appear in the new series, once again portraying Leland Palmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/twin-peaks-revival-release-date-david-lynch-directing-episodes-1201709267/|work=[[IndieWire]]|title=\u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Revival: Release Info Revealed & David Lynch Directing All 18 Episodes|author=Calvario, Liz|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}</ref> In the second episode of the renewed series, Leland appears in the Black Lodge imploring Cooper to \"find Laura\". In Part 18, he also repeats his instructions to Cooper when he returns to the Black Lodge. Due to time alterations following ''[[Part 17 (Twin Peaks)|Part 17]]'', it is said that Leland committed suicide on February 24, 1990, one year after his daughters disappearance (she was never confirmed to have been murdered in the changed timeline).<ref name=\"finaldossier\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Twin Peaks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Palmer, Leland}}\n[[Category:Twin Peaks characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Seattle]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional serial killers]]\n[[Category:Fictional pedophiles]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters involved in incest]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional filicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Palmer"}

The village of Putenda (''Petendpuszta'' between 1849 and 1936) was earlier a separate settlement, but it has grown together with H\u00e1cs.\n\n==History==\nH\u00e1cs was first mentioned as ''Alchy'', ''B\u00e9ndekpuszta'' as ''Bennuk'' and ''Terra Bendek'', ''Putenda'' as ''Pettend'', ''G\u00e1rdonypuszta'' as ''Gardon'' in medieval documents. During the ancient times Germanic tribes and Avars settled there. There were also two villages, ''Thuul'' and ''Sutak'' on this territory according to the papal [[tithe]] register. The second also had its own parish. They all disappeared during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman invasion]].\n\nThe landowners of ''Nagyh\u00e1cs'', the ''Inkey'' family invited Lutheran Germans to ''Nagyh\u00e1cs'' who came from [[Bonyh\u00e1d]] and its surrounding in [[Tolna County (former)|Tolna County]]. Originally they came from [[Hesse]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] to the [[Hungarian Kingdom]]. ''Antal Inkey'' and his wife, ''Ter\u00e9zia Kiss'' made a contract with 30 German settlers which detailed regulated their duties and laws. The first teacher of H\u00e1cs was ''Georgius Ritzl'' who worked there between 1828 and 1858.\n\nThe landowners of ''Kish\u00e1cs'', the ''Lengyel'' family settled Lutheran as well as Roman Catholic Germans from [[Veszpr\u00e9m County (former)|Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[Tolna County (former)|Tolna County]]. There were also some Hungarian families in the village.\n\nThe landowner of ''Pettend'', ''Ferdin\u00e1nd Fechtig'' settled Lutheran and Roman Catholic Hungarians and Germans in 1849. But according to the records there were also 2-3 Serbian and 1 Jewish family among the settlers.\n\nIn 1849 the whole population of H\u00e1cs was German with 414 people of which 400 Lutherans and 14 Roman Catholics. Four years later, in 1853 41 Lutheran family came to ''Nagyh\u00e1cs''. There was a huge cholera epidemic in 1855 which caused several deaths. In this years the residents built their new Lutheran church and the building of their school. The second one does not exist today. Until 1870 their worships were held only in German, after that in both Hungarian and German respectively on different Sundays.<ref>[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SOMM_SomAlm_052/?pg=121&layout=s&query=h\u00e1cs Szita L\u00e1szl\u00f3: Somogy megyei nemzetis\u00e9gek telep\u00fcl\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XVIII-XIX. sz\u00e1zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.

There was a huge conflagration in which the half of the houses burnt down. In 1876 the ''Inkey'' family established a foundation to spread the usage of Hungarian language among the residents which helped the [[magyarization]]. The village became administratively independent on August 9, 1907 from [[Lengyelt\u00f3ti]]. Its first judge was ''J\u00e1nos Gy\u00f6rgy Moschberger''. Later he was followed by G\u00e1bor Ember, Henrik Koch, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n F\u0171zfa, S\u00e1ndor Kirner and M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Vogel. In [[Austria-Hungary]] at the turn of the 19th century several people emigrated to the [[United States of America]] because of the poverty and joblessness. Fifty people left H\u00e1cs for the USA, most of them came back. In 1910 a new Lutheran school was built and the old one demolished. There was also a Roman Catholic school between 1878 and 1953.<ref>[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SOMM_SomAlm_052/?pg=121&layout=s&query=h\u00e1cs Szita L\u00e1szl\u00f3: Somogy megyei nemzetis\u00e9gek telep\u00fcl\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XVIII-XIX. sz\u00e1zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.

There are two marble plaques on the churches remembering on those who fell. Between the two world wars the village experienced a great economic development. In 1945 the older land system was abolished and all the residents got smaller land portions. The Catholics built a new church in 1953.\n\nOn October 26, 1956 the residents marched on the streets of the village and declared their solidarity with the revolutionaries of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. They elected their own Revolutionary Committee and a new secretary of the village council.\n\n==Main sights==\n* Lutheran Church - was dedicated on October 18, 1936\n* Roman Catholic Church - was built between 1949 and 1953 in [[Neo-Romanesque]], was dedicated to [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elisabeth]]\n* medieval chapel ruins in ''B\u00e9ndekpuszta'' - was built in the 12th or 13th century in [[Gothic style]].

The first teacher of H\u00e1cs was ''Georgius Ritzl'' who worked there between 1828 and 1858.\n\nThe landowners of ''Kish\u00e1cs'', the ''Lengyel'' family settled Lutheran as well as Roman Catholic Germans from [[Veszpr\u00e9m County (former)|Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[Tolna County (former)|Tolna County]]. There were also some Hungarian families in the village.\n\nThe landowner of ''Pettend'', ''Ferdin\u00e1nd Fechtig'' settled Lutheran and Roman Catholic Hungarians and Germans in 1849. But according to the records there were also 2-3 Serbian and 1 Jewish family among the settlers.\n\nIn 1849 the whole population of H\u00e1cs was German with 414 people of which 400 Lutherans and 14 Roman Catholics. Four years later, in 1853 41 Lutheran family came to ''Nagyh\u00e1cs''. There was a huge cholera epidemic in 1855 which caused several deaths. In this years the residents built their new Lutheran church and the building of their school. The second one does not exist today. Until 1870 their worships were held only in German, after that in both Hungarian and German respectively on different Sundays.<ref>[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SOMM_SomAlm_052/?pg=121&layout=s&query=h\u00e1cs Szita L\u00e1szl\u00f3: Somogy megyei nemzetis\u00e9gek telep\u00fcl\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XVIII-XIX. sz\u00e1zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.

There was a huge conflagration in which the half of the houses burnt down. In 1876 the ''Inkey'' family established a foundation to spread the usage of Hungarian language among the residents which helped the [[magyarization]]. The village became administratively independent on August 9, 1907 from [[Lengyelt\u00f3ti]]. Its first judge was ''J\u00e1nos Gy\u00f6rgy Moschberger''. Later he was followed by G\u00e1bor Ember, Henrik Koch, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n F\u0171zfa, S\u00e1ndor Kirner and M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Vogel. In [[Austria-Hungary]] at the turn of the 19th century several people emigrated to the [[United States of America]] because of the poverty and joblessness. Fifty people left H\u00e1cs for the USA, most of them came back. In 1910 a new Lutheran school was built and the old one demolished. There was also a Roman Catholic school between 1878 and 1953. <ref>[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SOMM_SomAlm_052/?pg=121&layout=s&query=h\u00e1cs Szita L\u00e1szl\u00f3: Somogy megyei nemzetis\u00e9gek telep\u00fcl\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XVIII-XIX. sz\u00e1zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.

There are two marble plaques on the churches remembering on those who fell. Between the two world wars the village experienced a great economic development. In 1945 the older land system was abolished and all the residents got smaller land portions. The Catholics built a new church in 1953. \n\nOn October 26, 1956 the residents marched on the streets of the village and declared their solidarity with the revolutionaries of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].

This name derives from the Celtic tribe of [[Boii]], who inhabited the area from the 4th century BC. ''Boiohaemum'', as it was originally known in Latin, comes from the Germanic \"Boi-haima\", meaning \"home of the Boii\". The name survived all the later migrations affecting the area, including the arrival of the [[Slavs]] and the creation of the Czech state. In the 9th century, the country became officially known as the Duchy of Bohemia, changing to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 11th century, and the Crown of Bohemia in the 14th century.

The name survived all the later migrations affecting the area, including the arrival of the [[Slavs]] and the creation of the Czech state. In the 9th century, the country became officially known as the Duchy of Bohemia, changing to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 11th century, and the Crown of Bohemia in the 14th century.

The peninsula has its origin in the retreat of the [[Linth]] glacier at the end of the [[last glacial period]] when Lake Z\u00fcrich was formed. This retreat left a [[moraine]] across the valley now occupied by Lake Z\u00fcrich. The higher southern section of this moraine extends above the lake's water level and forms the peninsula, whilst the lower northern section forms a shallow section in the otherwise deep lake. Together these separate Lake Z\u00fcrich into two parts, the larger lower lake to the north-west, and the smaller upper lake ([[Obersee (Z\u00fcrichsee)|''Obersee'']]) to the east.\n\nThe artificial [[Seedamm]] uses a combination of artificial causeways and bridges to cross the shallow water between the tip of the peninsula to [[Rapperswil]] on the northern shore of the lake, and carries both road and rail links. To the west of the Seedamm, there is a wooden bridge for pedestrians (''[[Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden]]''), which was built in 2001 as a reconstruction of the first bridge between eastern and western lakesides.<ref name=\"Seedamm wird saniert\">{{cite news | work = [[Tages-Anzeiger]] | date = March 9, 2010 | url = http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/region/Seedamm-wird-saniert/story/17119650 | title = Seedamm wird saniert | language = German |trans-title=Causeway is being renovated}}</ref> Since the construction of the [[Hurden ship canal]], across the base of the peninsula, the natural peninsula has been transformed into an artificial island. The ''Sternenbr\u00fccke'' bridge carries both road and railway across the ship canal.\n\nAt Hurden also the ''[[Frauenwinkel]]'' protected area is situated. Its name origins from a donation by the emperor [[Otto I]] in 965 AD to the pin ''Unserer lieben Frau'' (''Our Lady'') to the [[Einsiedeln Abbey]].<ref name=\"freienbach\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freienbach.ch/xml_1/internet/en/application/d820/d821/f828.cfm?highlight=Frauenwinkel|title=Frauenwinkel|publisher=Gemeinde Freienbach|author=|date=|accessdate=2014-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Transport ==\nThe village is transited by the Rapperswil\u2013Pf\u00e4ffikon railway line and by a major road, both of which cross the [[Seedamm]]. [[Hurden railway station]], in the village, is served by [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] lines [[S5 (ZVV)|S5]] and [[S40 (ZVV)|S40]]. In 1943 southern Hurden was divided by the construction of the [[Hurden ship canal]], which connected the upper to the lower Lake Z\u00fcrich. Now the ships of the [[Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft]] (ZSG) were able to pass from Lake Z\u00fcrich to the upper Lake Z\u00fcrich, and the peninsula actually was a real island which was cut off from the mainland. The ''Sternenbr\u00fccke'' bridge, across the Hurden ship canal, was renewed between March 15 and November 2010 to allow 40 ton trucks to cross the Seedamm.<ref name=\"Seedamm wird saniert\"/>\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological relicts have been found at the [[Rapperswil-Jona\u2013Technikum|''Technikum'' island settlement]],<ref name=\"palafittes-sg02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.palafittes.org/en/unesco-world-heritage/sites-switzerland/index.html|title=Sites Switzerland: ''Rapperswil-Jona\u2013Technikum'' (CH-SG-02)|publisher=palafittes.org|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007220441/http://www.palafittes.org/en/unesco-world-heritage/sites-switzerland/index.html|archive-date=2014-10-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the remains of a first [[Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden|wooden bridge]] (1523 BC, reconstructed in 2001) to Hurden located on the [[Obersee (Z\u00fcrichsee)|''Obersee'']] lakeshore nearby the so-called ''[[Heilig H\u00fcsli]]'' at the northwestern part of the [[Seedamm]] area.

The peninsula has its origin in the retreat of the [[Linth]] glacier at the end of the [[last glacial period]] when Lake Z\u00fcrich was formed. This retreat left a [[moraine]] across the valley now occupied by Lake Z\u00fcrich. The higher southern section of this moraine extends above the lake's water level and forms the peninsula, whilst the lower northern section forms a shallow section in the otherwise deep lake. Together these separate Lake Z\u00fcrich into two parts, the larger lower lake to the north-west, and the smaller upper lake ([[Obersee (Z\u00fcrichsee)|''Obersee'']]) to the east.\n\nThe artificial [[Seedamm]] uses a combination of artificial causeways and bridges to cross the shallow water between the tip of the peninsula to [[Rapperswil]] on the northern shore of the lake, and carries both road and rail links. To the west of the Seedamm, there is a wooden bridge for pedestrians (''[[Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden]]''), which was built in 2001 as a reconstruction of the first bridge between eastern and western lakesides.<ref name=\"Seedamm wird saniert\">{{cite news | work = [[Tages-Anzeiger]] | date = March 9, 2010 | url = http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/region/Seedamm-wird-saniert/story/17119650 | title = Seedamm wird saniert | language = German |trans-title=Causeway is being renovated}}</ref> Since the construction of the [[Hurden ship canal]], across the base of the peninsula, the natural peninsula has been transformed into an artificial island. The ''Sternenbr\u00fccke'' bridge carries both road and railway across the ship canal.\n\nAt Hurden also the ''[[Frauenwinkel]]'' protected area is situated. Its name origins from a donation by the emperor [[Otto I]] in 965 AD to the pin ''Unserer lieben Frau'' (''Our Lady'') to the [[Einsiedeln Abbey]].<ref name=\"freienbach\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freienbach.ch/xml_1/internet/en/application/d820/d821/f828.cfm?highlight=Frauenwinkel|title=Frauenwinkel|publisher=Gemeinde Freienbach|author=|date=|accessdate=2014-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Transport ==\nThe village is transited by the Rapperswil\u2013Pf\u00e4ffikon railway line and by a major road, both of which cross the [[Seedamm]]. [[Hurden railway station]], in the village, is served by [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] lines [[S5 (ZVV)|S5]] and [[S40 (ZVV)|S40]]. In 1943 southern Hurden was divided by the construction of the [[Hurden ship canal]], which connected the upper to the lower Lake Z\u00fcrich. Now the ships of the [[Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft]] (ZSG) were able to pass from Lake Z\u00fcrich to the upper Lake Z\u00fcrich, and the peninsula actually was a real island which was cut off from the mainland. The ''Sternenbr\u00fccke'' bridge, across the Hurden ship canal, was renewed between March 15 and November 2010 to allow 40 ton trucks to cross the Seedamm.<ref name=\"Seedamm wird saniert\"/>\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological relicts have been found at the [[Rapperswil-Jona\u2013Technikum|''Technikum'' island settlement]],<ref name=\"palafittes-sg02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.palafittes.org/en/unesco-world-heritage/sites-switzerland/index.html|title=Sites Switzerland: ''Rapperswil-Jona\u2013Technikum'' (CH-SG-02)|publisher=palafittes.org|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007220441/http://www.palafittes.org/en/unesco-world-heritage/sites-switzerland/index.html|archive-date=2014-10-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the remains of a first [[Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden|wooden bridge]] (1523 BC, reconstructed in 2001) to Hurden located on the [[Obersee (Z\u00fcrichsee)|''Obersee'']] lakeshore nearby the so-called ''[[Heilig H\u00fcsli]]'' at the northwestern part of the [[Seedamm]] area.
