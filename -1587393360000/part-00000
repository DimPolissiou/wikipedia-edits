As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in [[street gangs]] (and conversely, some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers),{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} though such membership was not necessarily an inherent principle of the subculture.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}\n\nEthnically, original greasers were  composed mostly of [[Italian Americans]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Chicanos]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Since both of these peoples were mostly [[olive skin|olive skinned]], the \"greaser\" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban, ethnic, lower-class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor [[Italian American]]s and [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City#1950s|Puerto Ricans]] in [[New York City]] in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating [[sexual violence]], stoking fear among middle-class males and a degree of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] among middle-class females.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== Decline and modern incarnations ===\nThough the television show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' helped to \"sanitize\" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] was still seen as a key component of the modern character.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Footnote #56}} By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s [[nostalgia]] and cultural revival.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=184}}\n\n== Fashion, style, and culture ==\n[[File:Young greaser.jpg|thumb|Young greaser in the Southeastern United States, 1956]]\nThe most notable physical characteristic of greasers was the greased hairstyles they fashioned through the use of hair products such as [[pomade]] or [[petroleum jelly]], which necessitated frequent combing and reshaping to maintain.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} Males sported coiffures adopted from early rock 'n' roll and [[rockabilly]]\nperformers such as [[Elvis Presley]], among them the Folsom, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]], Elephant's trunk, and [[Duck's ass]], while females commonly [[backcombing|backcombed]] or teased their hair.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=140}}\n\nMale greasers typically wore loose cotton [[twill]] trousers, common among the working class, or dark blue [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] [[blue jeans|jeans]], widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s. The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots,{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} including [[cowboy boots|cowboy]], steel-toed [[engineer boot|engineer]], or [[Harness boots|harness]] styles. Other footwear choices included [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[brothel creeper]]s.{{sfn|Blanco F.|2015|p=137}} Male tops were typically solid black or white [[T-shirt]]s, [[ringer T-shirt]]s, or sometimes [[tank tops]] (which would have been retailed as [[underwear]]). Choices of outerwear included denim or [[leather jacket]]s (including [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing, such as tight and cropped [[capri pants|capris]] and [[pedal pushers]] (broadly popular during the time period).{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n=== Music tastes ===\nIn the early 1950s, there was significant greaser interest in [[doo-wop]], a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were heavily associated with the culture surrounding [[rock n' roll]], a musical genre that had induced feelings of a [[moral panic]] among older middle-class generations during the mid-to-late 1950s, to whom greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and [[juvenile delinquency]] professed by several important social and cultural observers of the time.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==\n[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|Greaser revival look in 1974]]\nThe first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.{{sfn|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=185}} The band [[Sha-Na-Na]] models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly [[Ivy League]]rs).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/danny-mcbride-guitarist-with-rockn-roll-revivalists-sha-na-na-1773502.html?action=Popup|date=April 10, 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=Danny McBride: Guitarist with rock'n' roll revivalists Sha Na Na}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rockers (youth movement)|Rockers]], similar subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Teddy Boy]], a contemporary subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Nozem]], a similar subculture in the Netherlands\n* [[Raggare]], a similar subculture in Sweden\n* [[Bodgies and widgies]], a similar subculture in Australia\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| last = Blanco F.| first = Jos\u00e9| title = Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 23 November 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&dq=&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781610693103|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| editor-last = Gelder| editor-first = Ken| editor-last2 = Thornton| editor-first2 = Sarah|editorlink2=Sarah Thornton| title = The Subcultures Reader| publisher = Psychology Press | edition = illustrated, reprint| date = 1997| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BDa6PDEgiawC&dq=| isbn = 9780415127271| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Moore| first = Jennifer Grayer| title = Street Style in America: An Exploration| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 2017| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8x8uDwAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781440844621| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Symmons| first = Tom| title = The New Hollywood Historical Film: 1967\u201378| publisher = Springer| edition = illustrated| date = 2016| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T_xjDAAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781137529305| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web| url = https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/pachucos-and-teddy-boys-how-generations-of-youth-in-the-us-and-uk-borrowed-from-each| title = Pachucos and Teddy Boys: How Generations of Youth in the U.S. and U.K. Borrowed From Each Other| last = Torres| first = Lucia| date = January 12, 2017| publisher = [[KCET|KCETLink]]| access-date = August 7, 2017| ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Tricario |first=Donald| chapter= 10.

As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in [[street gangs]] (and conversely, some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers),{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} though such membership was not necessarily an inherent principle of the subculture.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}\n\nEthnically, original greasers were  composed mostly of [[Italian Americans]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Chicanos]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Since both of these peoples were mostly [[olive skin|olive skinned]], the \"greaser\" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban, ethnic, lower-class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor [[Italian American]]s and [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City#1950s|Puerto Ricans]] in [[New York City]] in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating [[sexual violence]], stoking fear among middle-class males and a degree of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] among middle-class females.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== Decline and modern incarnations ===\nThough the television show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' helped to \"sanitize\" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] was still seen as a key component of the modern character.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Footnote #56}} By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s [[nostalgia]] and cultural revival.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=184}}\n\n== Fashion, style, and culture ==\n[[File:Young greaser.jpg|thumb|Young greaser in the Southeastern United States, 1956]]\nThe most notable physical characteristic of greasers was the greased hairstyles they fashioned through the use of hair products such as [[pomade]] or [[petroleum jelly]], which necessitated frequent combing and reshaping to maintain.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} Males sported coiffures adopted from early rock 'n' roll and [[rockabilly]]\nperformers such as [[Elvis Presley]], among them the Folsom, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]], Elephant's trunk, and [[Duck's ass]], while females commonly [[backcombing|backcombed]] or teased their hair.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=140}}\n\nMale greasers typically wore loose cotton [[twill]] trousers, common among the working class, or dark blue [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] [[blue jeans|jeans]], widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s. The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots,{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} including [[cowboy boots|cowboy]], steel-toed [[engineer boot|engineer]], or [[Harness boots|harness]] styles. Other footwear choices included [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[brothel creeper]]s.{{sfn|Blanco F.|2015|p=137}} Male tops were typically solid black or white [[T-shirt]]s, [[ringer T-shirt]]s, or sometimes [[tank tops]] (which would have been retailed as [[underwear]]). Choices of outerwear included denim or [[leather jacket]]s (including [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing, such as tight and cropped [[capri pants|capris]] and [[pedal pushers]] (broadly popular during the time period).{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n=== Music tastes ===\nIn the early 1950s, there was significant greaser interest in [[doo-wop]], a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were heavily associated with the culture surrounding [[rock n' roll]], a musical genre that had induced feelings of a [[moral panic]] among older middle-class generations during the mid-to-late 1950s, to whom greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and [[juvenile delinquency]] professed by several important social and cultural observers of the time.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==\n[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|Greaser revival look in 1974]]\nThe first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.{{sfn|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=185}} The band [[Sha-Na-Na]] models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly [[Ivy League]]rs).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/danny-mcbride-guitarist-with-rockn-roll-revivalists-sha-na-na-1773502.html?action=Popup|date=April 10, 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=Danny McBride: Guitarist with rock'n' roll revivalists Sha Na Na}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rockers (youth movement)|Rockers]], similar subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Teddy Boy]], a contemporary subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Nozem]], a similar subculture in the Netherlands\n* [[Raggare]], a similar subculture in Sweden\n* [[Bodgies and widgies]], a similar subculture in Australia\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| last = Blanco F.| first = Jos\u00e9| title = Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 23 November 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&dq=&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781610693103|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| editor-last = Gelder| editor-first = Ken| editor-last2 = Thornton| editor-first2 = Sarah|editorlink2=Sarah Thornton| title = The Subcultures Reader| publisher = Psychology Press | edition = illustrated, reprint| date = 1997| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BDa6PDEgiawC&dq=| isbn = 9780415127271| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Moore| first = Jennifer Grayer| title = Street Style in America: An Exploration| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 2017| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8x8uDwAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781440844621| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Symmons| first = Tom| title = The New Hollywood Historical Film: 1967\u201378| publisher = Springer| edition = illustrated| date = 2016| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T_xjDAAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781137529305| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web| url = https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/pachucos-and-teddy-boys-how-generations-of-youth-in-the-us-and-uk-borrowed-from-each| title = Pachucos and Teddy Boys: How Generations of Youth in the U.S. and U.K. Borrowed From Each Other| last = Torres| first = Lucia| date = January 12, 2017| publisher = [[KCET|KCETLink]]| access-date = August 7, 2017| ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Tricario |first=Donald| chapter= 10.

It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes [[consumerism]], [[corporatism]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K. |title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class'', or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are interrupted when AUTO's first mate GO-4 arrives and stows the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E saves the plant from being lost for good, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to go back. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. When McCrea countermands this directive, AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. McCrea struggles with AUTO while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO crushes WALL-E in the Holo-Detector, but McCrea deactivates AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to prevent anyone to return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, \"You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?\"<ref name=notes/><ref name=\"dvd-mother\">DVD. Scene 16. \"Captain on Deck\".

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a [[Christmas tree]].

The coach class with living/shopping spaces has \"S\" shapes as people are always looking for \"what's around the corner\". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs.

Katherine Ellison asserts that \"Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of [[solid waste]] per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.\" [[Landfill]]s were filling up so quickly that predictions were made that the UK could run out of landfill space by the year 2017.<ref name=\"Ellison, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|title=Talking Trash|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=October 2008|volume=6, No. 8|jstor=20440969|pages=456}}</ref>\n\n===Environment, waste and nostalgia===\n{{further|Pollution}}\nIn the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature\u2014that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along.\"<ref name=dreher/>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dove Sent Forth from the Ark.png|thumb|upright|The ''Axiom'' and EVE have been compared to the legend of [[Noah's Ark]] and the dove that Noah sets forth from the Ark.]]\n\nStanton, who is a Christian,<ref name=world>{{cite news|author=Megan Basham|date=June 28, 2008|title=WALL-E world|work=[[World (magazine)|World]]|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14127|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> named EVE after the [[Eve|Biblical figure]] because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of [[Adam]], before God created his wife.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Moring|title=The Little Robot That Could|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 24, 2008|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html|accessdate=November 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731105235/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html |archivedate = July 31, 2008}}</ref> Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the \"false god\" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers.

It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class'', or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are interrupted when AUTO's first mate GO-4 arrives and stows the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E saves the plant from being lost for good, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to go back. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. When McCrea countermands this directive, AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. McCrea struggles with AUTO while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO crushes WALL-E in the Holo-Detector, but McCrea deactivates AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to prevent anyone to return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant.

He concluded, \"By steering conservative families away from ''WALL-E'', these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice.\"<ref name=\"ford\">{{cite journal | author = Patrick J.

He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by WALL-E}}\n''WALL-E'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Mixing]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (Sound Editing), and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (Original Screenplay).<ref name=\"Oscars2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |title=The 81st Academy Awards (2009) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 22, 2011|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars 2009: The nominees|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 22, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nomination,<ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael Cieply |author2=Brooks Barnes |title=Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners as Oscar Contenders|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bandyk |first=Matthew |title=Academy Awards Controversy: Wall-E Gets Snubbed For Best Picture Oscar |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar.html |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180938/http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] commented that \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Academy accused of snubbing Dark Knight, Wall-E |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
