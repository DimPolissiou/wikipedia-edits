About ten minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported that the source of the sound moved from the east to the north of them. The sounds were accompanied by a [[shock wave]] that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away.\n\nThe explosion registered at [[seismology|seismic stations]] across [[Eurasia]], and air waves from the blast were detected in Germany, Denmark, Croatia, the United Kingdom, and as far away as [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Whipple|first=F.

The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it as if my shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few metres. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing, the Earth shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed my head down, fearing rocks would smash it.

We heard whistling and felt strong wind. Chekaren said, 'Can you hear all those birds flying overhead?' We were both in the hut, couldn't see what was going on outside. Suddenly, I got shoved again, this time so hard I fell into the fire. I got scared. Chekaren got scared too. We started crying out for father, mother, brother, but no one answered. There was noise beyond the hut, we could hear trees falling down. Chekaren and I got out of our sleeping bags and wanted to run out, but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The Earth began to move and rock, the wind hit our hut and knocked it over. My body was pushed down by sticks, but my head was in the clear. Then I saw a wonder: trees were falling, the branches were on fire, it became mighty bright, how can I say this, as if there was a second sun, my eyes were hurting, I even closed them. It was like what the Russians call lightning. And immediately there was a loud thunderclap. This was the second thunder. The morning was sunny, there were no clouds, our Sun was shining brightly as usual, and suddenly there came a second one!\n\nChekaren and I had some difficulty getting out from under the remains of our hut. Then we saw that above, but in a different place, there was another flash, and loud thunder came. This was the third thunder strike. Wind came again, knocked us off our feet, struck the fallen trees.\n\nWe looked at the fallen trees, watched the tree tops get snapped off, watched the fires. Suddenly Chekaren yelled \"Look up\" and pointed with his hand. I looked there and saw another flash, and it made another thunder. But the noise was less than before. This was the fourth strike, like normal thunder.\n\nNow I remember well there was also one more thunder strike, but it was small, and somewhere far away, where the Sun goes to sleep.}}\n\n''Sibir'' newspaper, 2 July 1908:<ref>Vasiliev, Section 1, Item 2</ref>\n\n{{Quote|On the morning of 17th of June,<ref>[[Gregorian calendar]]: 30 June</ref> around 9:00, we observed an unusual natural occurrence. In the north Karelinski village [200 [[verst]] ({{convert|213|km|mi|abbr=on}}) north of Kirensk] the peasants saw to the northwest, rather high above the horizon, some strangely bright (impossible to look at) bluish-white heavenly body, which for 10 minutes moved downwards. The body appeared as a \"pipe\", i.e., a cylinder. The sky was cloudless, only a small dark cloud was observed in the general direction of the bright body. It was hot and dry. As the body neared the ground (forest), the bright body seemed to smudge, and then turned into a giant billow of black smoke, and a loud knocking (not thunder) was heard as if large stones were falling, or artillery was fired. All buildings shook. At the same time the cloud began emitting flames of uncertain shapes. All villagers were stricken with panic and took to the streets, women cried, thinking it was the end of the world.\n\nThe author of these lines was meantime in the forest about 6 versts [6.4&nbsp;km] north of Kirensk and heard to the north east some kind of artillery barrage, that repeated in intervals of 15 minutes at least 10 times.

The first thump was followed by a second, and then a third. Then the interval between the first and the third thumps was accompanied by an unusual underground rattle, similar to a railway upon which dozens of trains are travelling at the same time. Afterward, for 5 to 6 minutes an exact likeness of artillery fire was heard: 50 to 60 salvoes in short, equal intervals, which got progressively weaker. After 1.5\u20132 minutes after one of the \"barrages\" six more thumps were heard, like cannon firing, but individual, loud and accompanied by tremors.\n\nThe sky, at the first sight, appeared to be clear. There was no wind and no clouds.

In 1921, the Russian [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Leonid Kulik]] led a team to the Podkamennaya 7845656783625nd8znvt87z8fiuh355b7Tunguska River basin to conduct a survey for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tunguska Impact--100 Years Later |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/30jun_tunguska |website=NASA Science |accessdate=13 January 2019}}</ref> Although they never visited the central blast area, the many local accounts of the event led Kulik to believe that the explosion had been caused by a giant [[impact event|meteorite impact]]. Upon returning, he persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the suspected impact zone, based on the prospect of salvaging [[meteoric iron]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201806/history.cfm|title=This Month in Physics History|date=June 2018|website=American Physical Society|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|thumb|Photograph from Kulik's 1929 expedition taken near the Hushmo River]]\nKulik led a scientific expedition to the Tunguska blast site in 1927.

These effects are caused by the [[blast wave]] produced by large air burst explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, but remain standing upright, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.\n\nSoviet experiments performed in the mid-1960s, with model forests (made of [[match]]es on wire stakes) and small explosive charges slid downward on wires, produced butterfly-shaped blast patterns similar to the pattern found at the Tunguska site. The experiments suggested that the object had approached at an angle of roughly 30 degrees from the ground and 115 degrees from north and had exploded in mid-air.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=1156463|title=Siberian Apocalypse}}</ref>\n\n====Asteroid or comet?====\nIn 1930, the British astronomer [[Francis John Welsh Whipple|F. J. W. Whipple]] suggested that the Tunguska body was a small [[comet]]. A comet is composed of [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[volatiles]], such as water ice and frozen gases, and could have been completely [[vaporization|vaporised]] by the impact with Earth's atmosphere, leaving no obvious traces. The comet hypothesis was further supported by the glowing skies (or \"skyglows\" or \"bright nights\") observed across Eurasia for several evenings after the impact, which are possibly explained by dust and ice that had been dispersed from the [[comet's tail]] across the upper atmosphere.<ref name=shoe/> The cometary hypothesis gained a general acceptance among Soviet Tunguska investigators by the 1960s.<ref name=shoe/>\n\nIn 1978, Slovak astronomer [[\u013dubor Kres\u00e1k]] suggested that the body was a fragment of [[Comet Encke]]. This is a [[periodic comet]] with an extremely short period of three years that stays entirely within the orbit of Jupiter. It is also responsible for the [[Beta Taurids]], an annual [[meteor shower]] with a maximum activity around 28\u201329 June. The Tunguska event coincided with the peak activity of that shower,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Tunguska object\u2014A fragment of Comet Encke|journal=Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia |volume=29|issue=3|pages=129 |year=1978|bibcode=1978BAICz..29..129K|last1=Kresak |first1=L' }}</ref> and the approximate trajectory of the Tunguska object is consistent with what would be expected from a fragment of Comet Encke.<ref name=shoe/> It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground.

He pointed out that a body composed of cometary material, travelling through the atmosphere along such a shallow trajectory, ought to have disintegrated, whereas the Tunguska body apparently remained intact into the lower atmosphere. Sekanina argued that the evidence pointed to a dense, rocky object, probably of [[asteroid]]al origin. This hypothesis was further boosted in 2001, when Farinella, Foschini, ''et al.'' released a study calculating the probabilities based on orbital modelling extracted from the atmospheric trajectories of the Tunguska object. They concluded with a probability of 83% that the object moved on an asteroidal path originating from the [[asteroid belt]], rather than on a cometary one (probability of 17%).<ref name=Farinella-2001>{{cite journal|last1=Farinella|first1=Paolo|last2=Foschini|first2=L.|last3=Froeschl\u00e9|first3=Christiane|last4=Gonczi|first4=R.|last5=Jopek|first5=T.

It has been hypothesised that the passage of the asteroid through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about {{convert|60|m}} across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary [[chondrite]] and a [[carbonaceous chondrite]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Typical carbonaceous chondrite substance tends to be dissolved with water rather quickly unless it is frozen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arctic Asteroid!|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast01jun_1m|website=Science at NASA|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Chyba]] and others have proposed a process whereby a stony meteorite could have exhibited the behaviour of the Tunguska impactor. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body's descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all of its energy at once. The result is no crater, with damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, and all of the damage resulting from the thermal energy released in the blast.\n\nThree-dimensional numerical modelling of the Tunguska impact done by Utyuzhnikov and Rudenko in 2008<ref name=2008URpdf>Utyuzhnikov, S.

Researchers used data from both Tunguska and Chelyabinsk to perform a statistical study of over 50 million combinations of bolide and entry properties that could produce Tunguska-scale damage when breaking apart or exploding at similar altitudes. Some models focused on combinations of properties which created scenarios with similar effects to the tree fall pattern as well as the atmospheric and seismic pressure waves of Tunguska. Four different computer models produced similar results; they concluded that the likeliest candidate for the Tunguska impactor was a stony body between {{convert|164|and|262|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter, entering the atmosphere at roughly {{convert|34000|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}, exploding at {{convert|6|to|9|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} altitude, and releasing explosive energy equivalent to between 10 and 30 megatons.

About ten minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported that the source of the sound moved from the east to the north of them. The sounds were accompanied by a [[shock wave]] that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away.\n\nThe explosion registered at [[seismology|seismic stations]] across [[Eurasia]], and air waves from the blast were detected in Germany, Denmark, Croatia, the United Kingdom, and as far away as [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Whipple|first=F.

The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it as if my shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat.

Suddenly, I got shoved again, this time so hard I fell into the fire. I got scared. Chekaren got scared too. We started crying out for father, mother, brother, but no one answered. There was noise beyond the hut, we could hear trees falling down. Chekaren and I got out of our sleeping bags and wanted to run out, but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The Earth began to move and rock, the wind hit our hut and knocked it over. My body was pushed down by sticks, but my head was in the clear. Then I saw a wonder: trees were falling, the branches were on fire, it became mighty bright, how can I say this, as if there was a second sun, my eyes were hurting, I even closed them.

The body appeared as a \"pipe\", i.e., a cylinder. The sky was cloudless, only a small dark cloud was observed in the general direction of the bright body. It was hot and dry. As the body neared the ground (forest), the bright body seemed to smudge, and then turned into a giant billow of black smoke, and a loud knocking (not thunder) was heard as if large stones were falling, or artillery was fired. All buildings shook. At the same time the cloud began emitting flames of uncertain shapes. All villagers were stricken with panic and took to the streets, women cried, thinking it was the end of the world.\n\nThe author of these lines was meantime in the forest about 6 versts [6.4&nbsp;km] north of Kirensk and heard to the north east some kind of artillery barrage, that repeated in intervals of 15 minutes at least 10 times.

In 1921, the Russian [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Leonid Kulik]] led a team to the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin to conduct a survey for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tunguska Impact--100 Years Later |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/30jun_tunguska |website=NASA Science |accessdate=13 January 2019}}</ref> Although they never visited the central blast area, the many local accounts of the event led Kulik to believe that the explosion had been caused by a giant [[impact event|meteorite impact]]. Upon returning, he persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the suspected impact zone, based on the prospect of salvaging [[meteoric iron]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201806/history.cfm|title=This Month in Physics History|date=June 2018|website=American Physical Society|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tunguska event fallen trees.jpg|thumb|Photograph from Kulik's 1929 expedition taken near the Hushmo River]]\nKulik led a scientific expedition to the Tunguska blast site in 1927. He hired local [[Evenks|Evenki]] hunters to guide his team to the centre of the blast area, where they expected to find an [[impact crater]]. To their surprise, there was no crater to be found at [[ground zero]]. Instead they found a zone, roughly {{convert|8|km|mi}} across, where the trees were scorched and devoid of branches, but still standing upright.<ref name=\":1\" /> Trees more distant from the center had been partly scorched and knocked down in a direction away from the center, creating a large radial pattern of downed trees.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was established that the zone of leveled forest occupied an area of {{convert|2150|km2|abbr=on}}, its shape resembling a gigantic spread-eagled butterfly with a \"wingspan\" of {{convert|70|km||abbr=on}} and a \"body length\" of {{convert|55|km||abbr=on}}.<ref>Boyarkina, A.

After a laborious exercise in draining one of these [[bog]]s (the so-called \"Suslov's crater\", {{convert|32|m|abbr=on}} in diameter), he found an old [[tree stump]] on the bottom, ruling out the possibility that it was a meteoric crater. In 1938, Kulik arranged for an aerial photographic survey of the area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/APS-photolist.htm|author=Longo G.|title=The 1938 aerophotosurvey|accessdate=8 October 2017 }}</ref> covering the central part of the leveled forest ({{convert|250|km2}}).<ref name=Bronshten2000>See: Bronshten (2000), p.&nbsp;56.</ref> The original negatives of these aerial photographs (1,500 negatives, each {{convert|18|by|18|cm|abbr=off}}) were burned in 1975 by order of [[Yevgeny Krinov]], then Chairman of the Committee on Meteorites of the USSR Academy of Sciences, as part of an initiative to dispose of hazardous [[celluloid|nitrate film]].<ref name=Bronshten2000/> Positive prints were preserved for further study in the Russian city of [[Tomsk]].<ref>Rubtsov (2009), p.&nbsp;59.</ref>\n\nExpeditions sent to the area in the 1950s and 1960s found microscopic [[silicate]] and [[magnetite]] spheres in siftings of the soil. Similar spheres were predicted to exist in the felled trees, although they could not be detected by contemporary means. Later expeditions did identify such spheres in the resin of the trees. [[Chemical analysis]] showed that the spheres contained high proportions of [[nickel]] relative to iron, which is also found in [[meteorite]]s, leading to the conclusion they were of extraterrestrial origin. The concentration of the spheres in different regions of the soil was also found to be consistent with the expected distribution of debris from a meteoroid [[air burst]].<ref name=Florenskiy/> Later studies of the spheres found unusual ratios of numerous other metals relative to the surrounding environment, which was taken as further evidence of their extraterrestrial origin.<ref name=anomalies>Kolesnikov ''et al.'' \"Finding of probable Tunguska Cosmic Body material: isotopic anomalies of carbon and hydrogen in peat\", ''[[Planetary and Space Science]]'', Volume 47, Issues 6\u20137, 1 June 1999, Pages 905\u2013916.</ref>\n\nChemical analysis of [[peat bog]]s from the area also revealed numerous anomalies considered consistent with an impact event. The [[isotopic signature]]s of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen at the layer of the bogs corresponding to 1908 were found to be inconsistent with the isotopic ratios measured in the adjacent layers, and this abnormality was not found in bogs located outside the area.

These effects are caused by the [[blast wave]] produced by large air burst explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, but remain standing upright, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.\n\nSoviet experiments performed in the mid-1960s, with model forests (made of [[match]]es on wire stakes) and small explosive charges slid downward on wires, produced butterfly-shaped blast patterns similar to the pattern found at the Tunguska site. The experiments suggested that the object had approached at an angle of roughly 30 degrees from the ground and 115 degrees from north and had exploded in mid-air.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=1156463|title=Siberian Apocalypse}}</ref>\n\n====Asteroid or comet?====\nIn 1930, the British astronomer [[Francis John Welsh Whipple|F. J. W. Whipple]] suggested that the Tunguska body was a small [[comet]]. A comet is composed of [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[volatiles]], such as water ice and frozen gases, and could have been completely [[vaporization|vaporised]] by the impact with Earth's atmosphere, leaving no obvious traces. The comet hypothesis was further supported by the glowing skies (or \"skyglows\" or \"bright nights\") observed across Eurasia for several evenings after the impact, which are possibly explained by dust and ice that had been dispersed from the [[comet's tail]] across the upper atmosphere.<ref name=shoe/> The cometary hypothesis gained a general acceptance among Soviet Tunguska investigators by the 1960s.<ref name=shoe/>\n\nIn 1978, Slovak astronomer [[\u013dubor Kres\u00e1k]] suggested that the body was a fragment of [[Comet Encke]]. This is a [[periodic comet]] with an extremely short period of three years that stays entirely within the orbit of Jupiter. It is also responsible for the [[Beta Taurids]], an annual [[meteor shower]] with a maximum activity around 28\u201329 June. The Tunguska event coincided with the peak activity of that shower,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Tunguska object\u2014A fragment of Comet Encke|journal=Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia |volume=29|issue=3|pages=129 |year=1978|bibcode=1978BAICz..29..129K|last1=Kresak |first1=L' }}</ref> and the approximate trajectory of the Tunguska object is consistent with what would be expected from a fragment of Comet Encke.<ref name=shoe/> It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground.

He pointed out that a body composed of cometary material, travelling through the atmosphere along such a shallow trajectory, ought to have disintegrated, whereas the Tunguska body apparently remained intact into the lower atmosphere. Sekanina argued that the evidence pointed to a dense, rocky object, probably of [[asteroid]]al origin. This hypothesis was further boosted in 2001, when Farinella, Foschini, ''et al.'' released a study calculating the probabilities based on orbital modelling extracted from the atmospheric trajectories of the Tunguska object. They concluded with a probability of 83% that the object moved on an asteroidal path originating from the [[asteroid belt]], rather than on a cometary one (probability of 17%).<ref name=Farinella-2001>{{cite journal|last1=Farinella|first1=Paolo|last2=Foschini|first2=L.|last3=Froeschl\u00e9|first3=Christiane|last4=Gonczi|first4=R.|last5=Jopek|first5=T.

It has been hypothesised that the passage of the asteroid through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about {{convert|60|m}} across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary [[chondrite]] and a [[carbonaceous chondrite]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Typical carbonaceous chondrite substance tends to be dissolved with water rather quickly unless it is frozen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arctic Asteroid!|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast01jun_1m|website=Science at NASA|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Chyba]] and others have proposed a process whereby a stony meteorite could have exhibited the behaviour of the Tunguska impactor. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body's descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all of its energy at once. The result is no crater, with damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, and all of the damage resulting from the thermal energy released in the blast.\n\nThree-dimensional numerical modelling of the Tunguska impact done by Utyuzhnikov and Rudenko in 2008<ref name=2008URpdf>Utyuzhnikov, S.

Researchers used data from both Tunguska and Chelyabinsk to perform a statistical study of over 50 million combinations of bolide and entry properties that could produce Tunguska-scale damage when breaking apart or exploding at similar altitudes. Some models focused on combinations of properties which created scenarios with similar effects to the tree fall pattern as well as the atmospheric and seismic pressure waves of Tunguska. Four different computer models produced similar results; they concluded that the likeliest candidate for the Tunguska impactor was a stony body between {{convert|164|and|262|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter, entering the atmosphere at roughly {{convert|34000|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}, exploding at {{convert|6|to|9|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} altitude, and releasing explosive energy equivalent to between 10 and 30 megatons.

The Kino ''The Genius of Buster Keaton'' DVD release presents about six minutes and thirty seconds, sourced from the Cineteca Nazionale of [[Rome]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe setting is the Virginia Hills.  Arbuckle and Keaton play revenue agents tasked with hunting down bootleggers and bringing them to justice. The duo, aided by dozens of volunteers (all of whom somehow manage to fit inside Buster's small car), set off to track down the bootleggers. Fatty and Buster get separated from the group and take a tumble down a hill, which leaves their pants dirty. After Fatty washes Buster in a river and leaves him to dry hanging upside down in a tree, he meets Alice (Alice Lake), the daughter of Jud Grew (Dudley), the head bootlegger; they rapidly develop a romance.\n\nAfter fighting another bootlegger who is madly in love with Alice (St. John), Fatty reunites with Buster and the two stumble across the bootlegger's storage space, where they find a stash of illegal moonshine. Fatty is ambushed and taken away by the bootlegger, but Buster gets away and dispatches the love rival bootlegger by pushing him off a cliff.\n\nFatty is taken back to the bootlegger's hideout, where, taking inspiration from [[The Count of Monte Cristo]] by [[Alexandre Dumas]], he escapes by pretending to be dead so that the bootleggers will throw him into the river.  He floats downstream before swimming to shore, where he reunites with Buster. The two make a plan to rescue Alice and to take down the bootlegger but realize that their band of volunteers is nowhere to be found. The love rival bootlegger sneaks up on them, knocks out Buster, and with help from his fellow bootleggers takes Fatty to a cabin and lights the fuse to a bomb inside. The cabin explodes, but then reassembles itself (i.e., the same film is run backwards), and he emerges totally unharmed. Fatty takes out the love rival bootlegger by using a gun that he has modified so that it can shoot around corners, and Buster dispatches the remaining bootleggers, except for the leader.\n\nThe leader proclaims that Fatty has proven himself worthy and gives him his blessing to marry Alice, but Fatty immediately refuses, revealing that he already has a wife.

The Kino ''The Genius of Buster Keaton'' DVD release presents about six minutes and thirty seconds, sourced from the Cineteca Nazionale of [[Rome]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe setting is the Virginia Hills.  Arbuckle and Keaton play revenue agents tasked with hunting down bootleggers and bringing them to justice. The duo, aided by dozens of volunteers (all of whom somehow manage to fit inside Buster's small car), set off to track down the bootleggers. Fatty and Buster get separated from the group and take a tumble down a hill, which leaves their pants dirty. After Fatty washes Buster in a river and leaves him to dry hanging upside down in a tree, he meets Alice (Alice Lake), the daughter of Jud Grew (Dudley), the head bootlegger; they rapidly develop a romance.\n\nAfter fighting another bootlegger who is madly in love with Alice (St. John), Fatty reunites with Buster and the two stumble across the bootlegger's storage space, where they find a stash of illegal moonshine. Fatty is ambushed and taken away by the bootlegger, but Buster gets away and dispatches the love rival bootlegger by pushing him off a cliff.\n\nFatty is taken back to the bootlegger's hideout, where, taking inspiration from [[The Count of Monte Cristo]] by [[Alexandre Dumas]], he escapes by pretending to be dead so that the bootleggers will throw him into the river.  He floats downstream before swimming to shore, where he reunites with Buster. The two make a plan to rescue Alice and to take down the bootlegger but realize that their band of volunteers is nowhere to be found. The love rival bootlegger sneaks up on them, knocks out Buster, and with help from his fellow bootleggers takes Fatty to a cabin and lights the fuse to a bomb inside. The cabin explodes, but then reassembles itself (i.e., the same film is run backwards), and he emerges totally unharmed. Fatty takes out the love rival bootlegger by using a gun that he has modified so that it can shoot around corners, and Buster dispatches the remaining bootleggers, except for the leader.\n\nThe leader proclaims that Fatty has proven himself worthy and gives him his blessing to marry Alice, but Fatty immediately refuses, revealing that he already has a wife. Buster agrees to marry Alice instead, and Fatty sets off down the hills towards his next adventure.\n\n==Historical Significance==\n\nThe film is one of the earliest (if not the earliest) to \"break the [[fourth wall]].\"<ref>Niebaur, Arbuckle and Keaton: Their 14 Film Collaborations, p. 95.</ref>  For example, after Fatty upbraids the heroine and throws her into a river, she emerges and tells him, \"I love you!\"  When her father says, \"This is crazy!,\" Fatty explains, \"Look, this is only a two-reeler.

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession.

Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared.

Although the plan seemed unattainable due to the severity of the war thus far, it had been appealing to the Catholic Emperor Charles I, who could have seen it as his duty as Apostolic King of Hungary to carry out the Church's will, or as a way to preserve his throne in the years to come. [[Pope John Paul II]] was also beatifying and canonizing a significantly larger number of individuals as saints during the later part of his reign as Pope, which could have influenced his decision to beatify Emperor Charles I as Charles the Blessed.<ref>{{cite news|author=By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/15/world/rome-journal-vatican-saint-factory-is-it-working-too-hard.html |title=Rome Journal - Vatican 'Saint Factory' - Is It Working Too Hard? |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=1989-04-15 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, Emperor Charles conceived of his office as a holy service to his people. His chief concern was to follow the Christian vocation to holiness also in his political actions. For this reason, his thoughts turned to social assistance.\n\nThe ''cause'' or campaign for his canonization began in 1949, when the testimony of his holiness was collected in the [[Archdiocese of Vienna]]. In 1954, the cause was opened and he was declared \"servant of God\", the first step in the process.

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry.

He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne.

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared. Attention has slowly returned.<ref>Hannes Leidinger, \" Historiography 1918-Today (Austria-Hungary)\" ''International encyclopedia of the First World War'' (Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 2017)   DOI: 10.15463/ie1418.10326</ref>\n\nHelmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], described Charles as \"a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician.\"<ref>see [https://www.dw.com/en/historians-question-the-beatification-of-blessed-charles/a-1092974 online]</ref> Others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried to stop the war in which his Empire was doing so poorly. The English [[Neo-Jacobite Revival|Neo-Jacobite]] writer, [[Herbert Vivian]], wrote: <blockquote>Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come.<ref>* {{cite book |last=Vivian |first=Herbert |title=The Life of the Emperor Charles of Austria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3jUAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Grayson and Grayson |date=1932 |oclc=10030055}}</ref></blockquote> [[Anatole France]], the French novelist, stated: \n<blockquote>This war without end is criminal. What is abominable is that they do not want to end it. No, they do not want. Do not try to tell me that there was no way to end it. Emperor Charles offered peace; he is the only decent man to have appeared in this war, and he was not listened to. There was, through him, a chance that could have been seized... Clemenceau called the emperor a \"rotten conscience,\" it's ignoble. Emperor Charles sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. [...] A king of France, yes a king, would have had pity on our poor, exhausted, bloodlet nation. However democracy is without a heart and without entrails.

[[Pope John Paul II]] was also beatifying and canonizing a significantly larger number of individuals as saints during the later part of his reign as Pope, which could have influenced his decision to beatify Emperor Charles I as Charles the Blessed.<ref>{{cite news|author=By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/15/world/rome-journal-vatican-saint-factory-is-it-working-too-hard.html |title=Rome Journal - Vatican 'Saint Factory' - Is It Working Too Hard? |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=1989-04-15 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, Emperor Charles conceived of his office as a holy service to his people.
