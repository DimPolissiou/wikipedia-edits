Lord Nelson Rathbone ([[Aidan Gillen]]) leads a band of [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] into the city, killing Lin's father and stealing the seal. With his dying breath, Lin's father gives her a box to send to her brother.\n\nIn Carson City, Sheriff Wang has captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy ([[Matt Hill]]) relaxes with a book, ''\"Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy\"'', a highly fictionalized account of the previous film's events; Wang is dismayed by his portrayal as cowardly sidekick the \"[[Shanghai]] Kid.\u201d Wang receives the [[puzzle box]] and a letter from Lin telling him of their father's death and that she has tracked the murderer to [[London]].\n\nWang travels to [[New York City]] to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon ([[Owen Wilson]]) and book passage to London. Roy has left his brief stint in [[Police|law enforcement]], broken off his romance with Falling Leaves, lost his gold investing in the [[Zeppelin]], and is now a waiter and part-time gigolo, who lost most of his fortune publishing his novels. They attempt [[prostitution]] to pay for tickets to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], but are interrupted by the [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York]] in search of his daughters, Roy's latest clients. The pair ship themselves to [[London]] in a crate.\n\nIn London, Wang and Roy are accosted by a gang including the young Charlie Chaplin ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]). After a struggle, they are arrested. In [[Scotland Yard]], Inspector Artie Doyle ([[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]]) thanks the two for defeating the [[Fleet Street]] gang. Wang finds Lin in custody, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone. Rathbone meets with Wu Chow ([[Donnie Yen]]), giving him the dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. Wang and Roy encounter Charlie and find an invitation to a gala at [[Buckingham Palace]].\n\nRoy and Wang infiltrate the gala in [[disguise]]: Roy as [[Major General]] \"[[Sherlock Holmes]]\" \u2013 a  name he derives from the face of a clock \u2013 and Wang as the \"[[Maharaja]] of Nevada\". Wang and Roy follow Lord Rathbone to a private library, where he slips through a secret passage. As Roy occupies himself with the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', Wang discovers a secret room of treasures from throughout the [[British Empire]]. Roy is rescued from Rathbone's guards by Lin, who has escaped Scotland Yard. The three see Rathbone give the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] brother of the [[Emperor of China]], which is then stolen by Charlie. Rathbone escapes. At a [[brothel]], Roy overhears Wang try to convince Lin that Roy is an unsuitable romantic partner. Lin discovers Roy and Wang in an inadvertently compromising position. They are captured by Rathbone, who reveals his plan to kill the British royal family and frame Lin.\n\nLater, Wong and Roy find Artie has been fired for Lin's escape. He deduces that Charlie is at [[Madame Tussauds]], where they save him from the Boxers but lose the seal and are captured by police. They are rescued by Charlie, revealed to be [[Charlie Chaplin]].  They escape and save the royal family from Wu Chow, whom Lin kills with a rocket. The three pursue Rathbone to the top of [[Big Ben]]. Roy is thrown off but manages to hang onto the clock face as Wang fights Rathbone. Roy saves Wang as Rathbone falls to his death.\n\nRoy and Wang are [[British honors system|knighted]], as is Artie, revealed to be [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Artie decides to write stories about his techniques of deductive reasoning, and asks Roy for use of the \"Sherlock Holmes\" name. Wang opens the box his father sent him to find a message reminding him of the importance of family.\n\nRoy proposes that he and Wang go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] to join the new [[Film|motion picture]] industry.
