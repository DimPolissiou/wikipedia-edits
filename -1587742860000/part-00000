{"title_page": "Structural adjustment loan", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n{{mergeto|Structural adjustment|discuss=Talk:Structural adjustment#Merger proposal|date=July 2019}}\n\n'''Structural adjustment loan''' ('''SAL''') The SAL is issued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to qualified member countries that have adopted strong macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment plans. The purpose is to adjust the country \u2019s economic structure, improve international competitiveness, and restore its balance of payments. Concessional loans that achieve a desirable status, achieve price stability, and sustained economic growth. Here, the desired position of the balance of payments means that a state has the ability to finance its current account deficit through capital inflows, and its development prospects are commensurate with its solvency, without the need to complain about trade and balance of payments.\n\nSAL initially financed the loan by selling gold held in trust funds and accepting donations from donor countries. Subsequent loans are based on the repayment of trust funds and interest earned. The SDR is the accounting unit of the loan, and the disbursement and repayment of the loan are in US dollars. The amount of SAL issued to a country is usually proportional to its quota in the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFrom the perspective of loan targets * SAL can be divided into three categories: economic growth-oriented, correction of balance of payments structural deficits, and poverty alleviation. It is worth mentioning that, with the increasing demand for structural adjustments in various countries, the boundaries between SAL and other types of loans issued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have become blurred. For example, both the SAF and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Loan (ESAF) issued by the International Monetary Fund tend to provide low-income member countries with preferential support for medium-term structural reforms, but enhanced structural adjustment loans are more supportive to promote growth and strengthen the balance of payments Status-oriented reform only. Another type of loan issued by the World Bank\u2014sector adjustment loans differs from SAF only in that the former places more emphasis on intra-sector adjustments.\n\n'''The advantages of SAL:'''\n\n1. Autonomy: During the entire SAL loan process, member countries always have the initiative in policy selection. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are obliged to provide member countries with advice, guidance and policy building, but they have no right to replace members The country \u2019s arbitration guarantees the economic autonomy of the member states.\n\n2. Flexibility. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have always taken flexible measures to avoid rigid lending regulations due to insufficient understanding of a country \u2019s situation. For example, taking into account the difficulties and uncertainties in the implementation of long-term policies by a country \u2019s domestic government, member countries are usually allowed to amend their adjustment plans. In the initial broad festival period when the demand for funds is large, the quota of a country is too low compared with its economic scale, and the adjustment plan is effective, the IMF and the World Bank are allowed to break the practice and adjust the specific Quota for loans issued by the state. ,\n\n3. Continuity. Due to the long time required for structural adjustment, the IMF and the World Bank generally prefer to provide a series rather than a loan to ensure the periodicity and continuity of the structural adjustment plan. Therefore, the loan becomes a catalyst for obtaining additional financing. This provides a guarantee for the fundamental structural adjustment of the comprehensive measures of key departments, and avoids the possible adverse effects of the inconsistency of the project loan cycle and the pace of policy reform.\n\n4. Thoroughness: The purpose of rooting out bad economic performance and supplemented by a series of supporting comprehensive policy measures, although this may make a country pay adjustment costs in the short term, but in the long run, it will definitely help As a country \u2019s economy is on track and achieving a virtuous circle, this is precisely the key to the difficulty of obtaining long-term benefits in the past, such as project loans and other forms of loans\n\nIn addition, SAL also has the advantages of long loan life, low loan interest rate, loose loan conditions, and easy negotiation. Because of this, SAL has been welcomed by many developing countries and has played a role of disagreement for the improvement of economic conditions in these countries. \n\n'''Dispute on structural adjustment loans''' \n\nThey carry (often controversial) policy conditions, which have included: (see [[Washington Consensus]]).\n\n# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline;\n# Redirection of public spending from subsidies (\"especially indiscriminate subsidies\") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like [[primary education]], [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;\n# [[Tax reform]]s which broaden the [[tax base]] and lower marginal tax rates, while minimizing [[dead weight loss]] and [[market distortion]]s;\n# [[Interest rates]] that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;\n# Competitive [[exchange rates]]; [[devaluation]] of currency to stimulate exports;\n# Trade liberalization \u2013 liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any [[trade protection]] to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs; the conversion of [[import quotas]] to [[import tariffs]];\n# [[Liberalization]] of inward [[foreign direct investment]];\n# [[Privatization]] of state enterprises;\n# [[Deregulation]] \u2013 abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudent oversight of financial institutions;\n# Legal security for [[property rights]].\n\nStructural adjustment loans are very controversial. For criticisms, see [[structural adjustment]].\n\nTake '''South Korea after 1997''' as an example. Since the loan conditions have a huge influence on the economy of the recipient countries, there are many arguments about the loan conditions. When the Asian financial crisis occurred in 1997, South Korea accepted various loan conditions while accepting the largest financial assistance in the history of the International Monetary Fund. The United States and the International Monetary Fund evaluated South Korea as one of the successful cases of the IMF's structural adjustment. They believe that South Korea has been closer to the developed countries after the IMF's structural adjustment. However, others doubt whether South Korea is a successful case of IMF structural adjustment. In the process of South Korea and the International Monetary Fund reaching an agreement, the United States played a major role in it. The US government's structural adjustment to South Korea should be based on its own interests. At present, South Korea's economic structure and financial market contain many problems, which leads to an increase in social problems in South Korea and the result of instability in South Korean society. Because the IMF is subject to the distribution of power and interests of major powers, it is difficult to implement actions with fair and objective criteria. The main reason is that the International Monetary Fund reflects the political issues of American financial hegemony and voting power to a certain extent. This has led to the request of the IMF for the aided country that may have been made while ignoring the actual situation of the aided country. It often overemphasizes market liberalization and financial market opening. In the long run, these loan conditions have brought bad results to the aided countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=degree&id=W2041930#|title=\u56fd\u9645\u8d27\u5e01\u57fa\u91d1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d37\u6b3e\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u53d7\u63f4\u56fd\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u6790\u2014\u2014\u4ee51997\u5e74\u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u97e9\u56fd\u4e3a\u4f8b|website=www.wanfangdata.com.cn|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nSome studies suggest that they have been \"weakly associated with growth and reform did seem to reduce inflation.\"<ref>Crisp, Brian; Kelly, Michael.

The episode follows series [[protagonist]]s [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] building an extremely large roller coaster panning from their backyard to throughout the city.\n\n\"Rollercoaster\" was written by co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]], the former of whom also directed the episode. The two used the episode to pitch the series to Disney. They recorded a set of storyboard reels, which Povenmire voiced over and sent them overseas. The preview of the episode totaled a combined 10.8 million viewers. In 2011, the episode was remade into a half-hour musical episode titled \"'''Rollercoaster: The Musical!'''\".\n\n==Plot summary==\nStepbrothers [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] ([[Vincent Martella]]) and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] ([[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]]) are sitting lazily under the big tree in their backyard when they decide to construct a large [[roller coaster]]. With their mother Linda ([[Caroline Rhea]]) at the grocery store, their sister [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) wants to catch them in the act and [[Gossip|\"bust\"]] them.\n\nCandace goes to the store to tell their Mom of the boys' activities, though she is keen on neglecting it. Isabella ([[Alyson Stoner]]) asks Candace at the Flynn-Fletcher house if Phineas and Ferb are home, but Candace ignores her. Isabella then goes to Phineas with hearts in her eyes and says her common [[catchphrase]] \"Whatcha doin'?\". She says \"Isn't that impossible?\" to Phineas and asks him to go swimming with her, but Phineas declines and Isabella leaves. Phineas and Ferb begin working on the coaster. Meanwhile, [[Perry the Platypus]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]) performs his act as a \"[[Espionage|secret Agent]] [[Perry the Platypus|P]]\", being informed by [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Recurring Characters#Major Monogram|Major Francis Monogram]] (Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh) that [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] (Dan Povenmire) has bought 80% of the Tri-State Area's [[Aluminum foil|tin foil]]. Perry darts off to investigate what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is doing.\n\nWith their rollercoaster finally finished, Phineas and Ferb unveil it to the neighborhood children in a [[glamour (presentation)|glamor]]-filled [[Laser lighting display|light show]] with notable guests being Isabella, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Ginger|Ginger]], and [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Katie|Katie]]. They immediately climb up the lift hill as Phineas shows everyone how to fasten their seatbelts, he then drops it after showing everyone how to release the buckle on the seatbelt, he then sits back down as the crest the top of the hill, they then pause as Phineas says \u201cYou all signed the waivers right?\u201d. Once he finished his sentence, the rollercoaster rockets down the 3 mile drop and does an Inclined Triangular Loop, an Inclined Circular Loop, and Four Zigzags, it then comes to another drop and whips through the Corkscrew Around The Interstate, then Rubber Snakes fall onto everyone as they are screaming at the top of their lungs until Phineas says \u201cRelax! They\u2019re Just Rubber!\u201d, The rollercoaster then dives into a Bucket Of Mud before shooting back out and going through a Carwash. The rollercoaster then comes to a complete stop as everyone is now squeaky clean, a worker rubs the front of the rollercoaster and waves goodbye. The rollercoaster rockets away and takes a quick trip through the \nAH-AH-AH-AH Section before diving down and turning through several loops around Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. and dives down another drop. Doofenshmirtz, meanwhile, reveals that he is using the tin foil to cover the eastern seaboard, then using a magnet to pull it, thereby reversing the Earth's rotation. Perry fights him, but Doofenshmirtz manages to get the magnet activating. However, Doofenshmirtz soon learns that his plan is flawed because the magnet has only taken the tin foil off the eastern seaboard, forming it into a 2-ton giant ball. Seeing that it's heading forward, Doofenshmirtz decides to separate the magnet from his machine to stop it, and Perry is forced to help him out.\n\nPerry attempts to solve the problem using a [[helicopter]] (causing The D.E.Inc to get hit), which inadvertently causes the rollercoaster to crumble and speed off the tracks. As they spiral around the world and eventually space, Candace continues to try and bust them, even on the way home. The magnet is stopped, as Phineas and Ferb return home, Candace a second too late. Isabella says that was the best ride ever and she and Phineas talk about Perry and that he may lay an egg. Ferb burps from having [[peanut butter]], which Isabella says was cool, and she leaves at that point. The episode ends with the roller coaster exploding in the boys' backyard tree and tin foil ball is seen rolling in the background setting.

When Candace and her mother leave the supermarket and are walking from the parking lot, the two [[Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo|future Candaces]] can be seen behind a car.

The episode follows series [[protagonist]]s [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] building an extremely large roller coaster panning from their backyard to throughout the city.\n\n\"Rollercoaster\" was written by co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]], the former of whom also directed the episode. The two used the episode to pitch the series to Disney. They recorded a set of storyboard reels, which Povenmire voiced over and sent them overseas. The preview of the episode totaled a combined 10.8 million viewers. In 2011, the episode was remade into a half-hour musical episode titled \"'''Rollercoaster: The Musical!'''\".\n\n==Plot summary==\nStepbrothers [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] ([[Vincent Martella]]) and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] ([[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]]) are sitting lazily under the big tree in their backyard when they decide to construct a large [[roller coaster]]. With their mother Linda ([[Caroline Rhea]]) at the grocery store, their sister [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) wants to catch them in the act and [[Gossip|\"bust\"]] them.\n\nCandace goes to the store to tell their Mom of the boys' activities, though she is keen on neglecting it. Isabella ([[Alyson Stoner]]) asks Candace at the Flynn-Fletcher house if Phineas and Ferb are home, but Candace ignores her. Isabella then goes to Phineas with hearts in her eyes and says her common [[catchphrase]] \"Whatcha doin'?\". She says \"Isn't that impossible?\" to Phineas and asks him to go swimming with her, but Phineas declines and Isabella leaves. Phineas and Ferb begin working on the coaster. Meanwhile, [[Perry the Platypus]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]) performs his act as a \"[[Espionage|secret Agent]] [[Perry the Platypus|P]]\", being informed by [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Recurring Characters#Major Monogram|Major Francis Monogram]] (Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh) that [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] (Dan Povenmire) has bought 80% of the Tri-State Area's [[Aluminum foil|tin foil]]. Perry darts off to investigate what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is doing.\n\nWith their rollercoaster finally finished, Phineas and Ferb unveil it to the neighborhood children in a [[glamour (presentation)|glamor]]-filled [[Laser lighting display|light show]] with notable guests being Isabella, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Ginger|Ginger]], and [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Katie|Katie]]. They immediately climb up the lift hill as Phineas shows everyone how to fasten their seatbelts, he then drops it after showing everyone how to release the buckle on the seatbelt, he then sits back down as the crest the top of the hill, they then pause as Phineas says \u201cYou all signed the waivers right?\u201d. Once he finished his sentence, the rollercoaster rockets down the 3 mile drop and does an Inclined Triangular Loop, an Inclined Circular Loop, and Four Zigzags, it then comes to another drop and whips through the Corkscrew Around The Interstate, then Rubber Snakes fall onto everyone as they are screaming at the top of their lungs until Phineas says \u201cRelax! They\u2019re Just Rubber!\u201d, The rollercoaster then dives into a Bucket Of Mud before shooting back out and going through a Carwash. The rollercoaster then comes to a complete stop as everyone is now squeaky clean, a worker rubs the front of the rollercoaster and waves goodbye. The rollercoaster rockets away and takes a quick trip through the \nAH-AH-AH-AH Section before diving down and turning through several loops around Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. and dives down another drop. Doofenshmirtz, meanwhile, reveals that he is using the tin foil to cover the eastern seaboard, then using a magnet to pull it, thereby reversing the Earth's rotation. Perry fights him, but Doofenshmirtz manages to get the magnet activating. However, Doofenshmirtz soon learns that his plan is flawed because the magnet has only taken the tin foil off the eastern seaboard, forming it into a 2-ton giant ball. Seeing that it's heading forward, Doofenshmirtz decides to separate the magnet from his machine to stop it, and Perry is forced to help him out.\n\nPerry attempts to solve the problem using a [[helicopter]] (causing The D.E.Inc to get hit), which inadvertently causes the rollercoaster to crumble and speed off the tracks. As they spiral around the world and eventually space, Candace continues to try and bust them, even on the way home. The magnet is stopped, as Phineas and Ferb return home, Candace a second too late. Isabella says that was the best ride ever and she and Phineas talk about Perry and that he may lay an egg. Ferb burps from having [[peanut butter]], which Isabella says was cool, and she leaves at that point. The episode ends with the roller coaster exploding in the boys' backyard tree and tin foil ball is seen rolling in the background setting. Upon the rollercoaster exploding Candace tries to bust the boys again. Mom responds by saying, \"Give it a rest, Candace!\"\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\n[[File:PitchPF.png|thumb|right|An original storyboard panel from the pitch reel sent to overseas executives for Disney.<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite video|title=''Original Pitch'' featurette, from Volume 1: The Fast and the Phineas|medium=DVD|date=2008}}</ref>]]\n{{see also2|[[Phineas and Ferb#Origins|Origins]]|[[Phineas and Ferb#Cast|Cast]]}}\nSeries co-creator [[Dan Povenmire]] attributed the genesis for the show to his childhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]].

The desktop environment was seen mostly on [[personal computer]]s until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional [[command-line interface]] (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.\n\nA desktop environment typically consists of [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[toolbars]], [[directory (file systems)|folders]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]] and [[Widget engine|desktop widgets]] (see [[Elements of graphical user interfaces]] and WIMP). A GUI might also provide [[drag and drop]] functionality and other features that make the [[desktop metaphor]] more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.\n\nWhile the term ''desktop environment'' originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|title=Window managers and desktop environments \u2013 Linux 101|website=clemsonlinux.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182940/http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|archivedate=2008-07-04}}</ref> This usage has been popularized by projects such as the [[Common Desktop Environment]], [[KDE#Plasma Workspaces|K Desktop Environment]], and [[GNOME]].\n\n== Implementation ==\nOn a system that offers a desktop environment, a [[window manager]] in conjunction with applications written using a [[widget toolkit]] are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. The window manager supports the [[user interaction]]s with the environment, while the toolkit provides developers a [[software library]] for [[Application software|applications]] with a unified look and behavior.\n\nA [[windowing system]] of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying [[operating system]] and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.\n\nApplications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a [[windowing toolkit]], generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.\n\n== History and common use ==\n{{Further|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n[[File:Smalltalk-76.png|left|thumb|The interim Dynabook desktop environment (1976; aka Smalltalk-76 running on Alto)]]The first desktop environment was created by [[Xerox]] and was sold with the [[Xerox Alto]] in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag.{{Dubious |reason=Alto was not a product and was not sold|date=October 2017}}<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Nathan |author-last=Lineback |url=http://toastytech.com/guis/alto.html |title=The Xerox Alto |publisher=Toastytech.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> With the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced a desktop environment on an affordable [[personal computer]], which also failed in the market.\n\nThe desktop metaphor was popularized on commercial [[personal computer]]s by the original [[Macintosh]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1984, and was popularized further by [[Windows]] from [[Microsoft]] since the 1990s. {{As of|2014}}, the most popular desktop environments are descendants of these earlier environments, including the [[Windows Aero|Aero environment]] used in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows&nbsp;7]], and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua environment]] used in [[macOS]]. When compared with the [[X Window System|X-based]] desktop environments available for [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]], the [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated \"seamless\" designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.\n\nMicrosoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, Chrome OS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&qpcal=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpsp=2011 |title=Operating System Market Share |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> however, {{As of|2015|lc=yes}} there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the [[X Window System]] or [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google's [[Chromebook]]s and [[Chromebox]]es, Intel's [[Next Unit of Computing|NUC]], the [[Raspberry Pi]], etc.{{Citation needed|reason=NUCs only bundled with Windows I believe|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the [[iOS]] (BSD-derived), [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Tizen]], [[Sailfish OS|Sailfish]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (all Linux-derived). Microsoft's [[Windows phone]], [[Windows RT]] and [[Windows&nbsp;10]] are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.\n\n== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==\n[[File:Popular free desktop environments.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A brief timeline of the most popular modern desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems (greyscale logos indicate when the project's development started, while colorized logos indicate the project's first release)]]\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update the timeline, and include the evolution of LXQt, merge with Razor-qt, etc.  Please review Talk page for details.  -->\n{{Further|Comparison of X Window System desktop environments}}\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update this to talk about Wayland too -->\nOn systems running the [[X Window System]] (typically Unix-family systems such as [[Linux]], [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|the BSDs]], and formal [[UNIX]] distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a [[window manager]] (such as [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]]), a [[file manager]] (such as [[GNOME Files|Files]] or [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]), a set of [[Skin (computing)|graphical themes]], together with [[Widget toolkit|toolkits]] (such as [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]) and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.\n\nSome window managers{{mdashb}}such as [[IceWM]], [[Fluxbox]], [[Openbox]], [[ROX Desktop]] and [[Window Maker]]{{mdashb}}contain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated [[spatial file manager]], while others like [[evilwm]] and [[wmii]] do not provide such elements. Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. [[KDE]], for example, provides so-called [[KIO]] slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.\n\nIn 1996 the [[KDE]] was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of [[GNOME]]. [[Xfce]] is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996,<ref name=\"Then\">{{citation |url=http://www.slashgear.com/xfce-creator-talks-linux-moblin-netbooks-and-open-source-0633329/ |title=Xfce creator talks Linux, Moblin, netbooks and open-source |last=Then |first=Ewdison |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=[[SlashGear]] |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> and focuses on speed and modularity, just like [[LXDE]] which was started in 2006. A [[comparison of X Window System desktop environments]] demonstrates the differences between environments. [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] were usually seen as dominant solutions, and these are still often installed by default on Linux systems. Each of them offers:\n* To programmers, a set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and [[human interface guidelines]].\n* To translators, a collaboration infrastructure.

Although striving for broadly similar goals, GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomics. KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate, is highly customizable, and contains many complex features, all whilst trying to establish sensible defaults. GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive, and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplification. Accordingly, each one attracts a different user and developer community. Technically, there are numerous technologies common to all Unix-like desktop environments, most obviously the [[X Window System]]. Accordingly, the [[freedesktop.org]] project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effort.\n\nAs GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers, users of less powerful or older computers often prefer alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance systems. Most commonly used lightweight desktop environments include [[LXDE]] and [[Xfce]]; they both use [[GTK+]], which is the same underlying toolkit GNOME uses. The [[MATE (software)|MATE]] desktop environment, a fork of GNOME&nbsp;2, is comparable to Xfce in its use of RAM and processor cycles, but is often considered more as an alternative to other lightweight desktop environments.\n\nFor a while, GNOME and KDE enjoyed the status of the most popular Linux desktop environments; later, other desktop environments grew in popularity. In April 2011, GNOME introduced a new interface concept with its [[GNOME 3|version 3]], while a popular Linux distribution [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] introduced its own new desktop environment, [[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]. Some users preferred to keep the traditional interface concept of [[GNOME 2]], resulting in the creation of [[MATE (software)|MATE]] as a GNOME&nbsp;2 fork.<ref>Thorsten Leemhuis (usinglinux1173.blogspot.com), August 5, 2012: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190415104204/https://usinglinux1173.blogspot.com/2019/04/common-desktop-features.html Comment: Desktop Fragmentation]</ref>\n\n== Examples of desktop environments ==\nThe most common desktop environment on personal computers is [[Microsoft Windows]]' built-in interface. It was titled [[Luna (theme)|Luna]] in [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Aero|Aero]] in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], [[Metro (design language)|Metro]] in [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 8.1|8.1]], and [[Fluent Design System|Fluent]] in [[Windows 10]]. Also common is [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]], included with Apple's [[macOS]].\n\nMainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems use the X Window System, and include [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]], and [[LXDE]], any of which may be selected by users and are not tied exclusively to the operating system in use.\n\nA number of other desktop environments also exist, including (but not limited to) [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]], [[Equinox Desktop Environment|EDE]], [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]], [[IRIX Interactive Desktop]], Sun's [[Java Desktop System]], [[Jesktop]], [[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]], [[Project Looking Glass]], [[ROX Desktop]], [[UDE]], [[Xito]], [[XFast]]. Moreover, there exists [[FVWM-Crystal]], which consists of a powerful configuration for the [[FVWM]] window manager, a theme and further adds, altogether forming a \"construction kit\" for building up a desktop environment.\n\n[[X window manager]]s that are meant to be usable stand-alone \u2014 without another desktop environment \u2014 also include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments, most prominently [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Other examples include [[OpenBox]], [[Fluxbox]], [[WindowLab]], [[Fvwm]], as well as [[Window Maker]] and [[AfterStep]], which both feature the [[NeXTSTEP]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] look and feel. However newer versions of some operating systems make self configure.\n\nThe [[Amiga]] approach to desktop environment was noteworthy: the original [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] desktop environment in [[AmigaOS]] evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solutions. Some of those descendants are the Scalos,<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris&nbsp;Haynes |url=http://scalos.noname.fr/ |title=Scalos \u2013 The Amiga Desktop Replacement |publisher=Scalos.noname.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> the [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]] desktop of [[MorphOS]], and the [[Wanderer (AROS)|Wanderer]] desktop of the [[AROS]] open source OS. WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga UI. Third-party [[Directory Opus]] software, which was originally just a [[navigational file manager]] program, evolved to become a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magellan.\n\nThere is the [[Workplace Shell]] that runs on IBM [[OS/2]] or [[eComStation]].\n\nThe [[BumpTop]] project is an experimental desktop environment. Its main objective is to replace the 2D paradigm with a \"real-world\" 3D implementation, where documents can be freely manipulated across a virtual table.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n{{See also|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"110px\">\nFile:AmbientDesktop.png|[[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]]\nFile:Budgie Desktop Environment.png|[[Budgie (desktop environment)|Budgie]]\nFile:CDE 2012 on Linux.png|[[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]]\nFile:Cinnamon 4.2.3 screenshot.png|[[Cinnamon (Desktop Environment)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:Deepin Screenshot.png|[[Deepin|Deepin DE]]\nFile:102shot xft1.png|[[Equinox Desktop Environment|EDE]]\nFile:Elokab-full-01.png|[http://sourceforge.net/projects/elokab/ Elokab]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Etoiledock.png|[[\u00c9toil\u00e9]]\nFile:GNOME 3.32.1.png|[[GNOME Shell]]\nFile:Gnustep.png|[[GNUstep]]\nFile:InnovaDE Kids V 0.1.3.png|[http://sourceforge.net/projects/innovadesktop/ Innova]\nFile:KDE Plasma 5.16.png|[[KDE Plasma 5]]\nFile:Liri Shell.png|[https://github.com/lirios/shell Liri Shell]\nFile:Lumina1.0.0-TrueOS.png|[[Lumina (desktop environment)|Lumina]]\nFile:LXDE desktop full.png|[[LXDE]]\nFile:LXQt 0.10 - Ambiance.png|[[LXQt]]\nFile:Ubuntu Mate 18.04.1 with MATE 1.20.1.png|[[MATE (software)|MATE]]\nFile:MaXX.png|[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234856/http://www.maxxinteractive.com/ MaXX]\nFile:Maynard desktop.png|[[Maynard (software)|Maynard]]\nFile:Symphonyosb1pr1.png|[[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]]\nFile:Bodhi-2016-10-29.png|[http://www.bodhilinux.com/moksha-desktop/ Moksha]\nFile:Elementary OS 5.1 Hera.png|[[Elementary (operating system)|Pantheon]]\nFile:LG3D memo board.jpeg|[[Project Looking Glass]]\nFile:Razor desktop.png|[[Razor-qt]]\nFile:Rox-desktop-2004.png|[[ROX Desktop]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]\nFile:TheShell.png|[https://vicr123.github.io/theshell/ theShell]\nFile:Screenshot of Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) R14.0.5 Development.png|[[Trinity (desktop environment)|Trinity]]\nFile:X-Window-System.png|[[twm]]\n\nFile:Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]\nFile:Vera Desktop.png|[https://github.com/vera-desktop/vera vera]\nFile:Wmaker-0.80.2.png|[[Window Maker]]\nFile:XFCE-4.12-Desktop-standard.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:Zorin OS 15.png|[[Zorin OS]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] \u2013 an alternative to X Windows which can run several different desktop environments\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{X desktop environments and window managers}}\n{{Operating system}}\n\n[[Category:Desktop environments| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|graphical user interface}}\n{{About|the operating system and user interface schema|desktop computing in general|desktop computer}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''desktop environment''' ('''DE''') is an [[implementation]] of the [[desktop metaphor]] made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer [[operating system]] that share a common [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), sometimes described as a [[graphical shell]].

This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.\n\nApplications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a [[windowing toolkit]], generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.\n\n== History and common use ==\n{{Further|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n[[File:Smalltalk-76.png|left|thumb|The interim Dynabook desktop environment (1976; aka Smalltalk-76 running on Alto)]]The first desktop environment was created by [[Xerox]] and was sold with the [[Xerox Alto]] in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag.{{Dubious |reason=Alto was not a product and was not sold|date=October 2017}}<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Nathan |author-last=Lineback |url=http://toastytech.com/guis/alto.html |title=The Xerox Alto |publisher=Toastytech.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> With the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced a desktop environment on an affordable [[personal computer]], which also failed in the market.\n\nThe desktop metaphor was popularized on commercial [[personal computer]]s by the original [[Macintosh]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1984, and was popularized further by [[Windows]] from [[Microsoft]] since the 1990s. {{As of|2014}}, the most popular desktop environments are descendants of these earlier environments, including the [[Windows Aero|Aero environment]] used in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows&nbsp;7]], and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua environment]] used in [[macOS]]. When compared with the [[X Window System|X-based]] desktop environments available for [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]], the [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated \"seamless\" designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.\n\nMicrosoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, Chrome OS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&qpcal=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpsp=2011 |title=Operating System Market Share |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> however, {{As of|2015|lc=yes}} there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the [[X Window System]] or [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google's [[Chromebook]]s and [[Chromebox]]es, Intel's [[Next Unit of Computing|NUC]], the [[Raspberry Pi]], etc.{{Citation needed|reason=NUCs only bundled with Windows I believe|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the [[iOS]] (BSD-derived), [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Tizen]], [[Sailfish OS|Sailfish]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (all Linux-derived). Microsoft's [[Windows phone]], [[Windows RT]] and [[Windows&nbsp;10]] are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.\n\n== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==\n[[File:Popular free desktop environments.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A brief timeline of the most popular modern desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems (greyscale logos indicate when the project's development started, while colorized logos indicate the project's first release)]]\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update the timeline, and include the evolution of LXQt, merge with Razor-qt, etc.  Please review Talk page for details.  -->\n{{Further|Comparison of X Window System desktop environments}}\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update this to talk about Wayland too -->\nOn systems running the [[X Window System]] (typically Unix-family systems such as [[Linux]], [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|the BSDs]], and formal [[UNIX]] distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a [[window manager]] (such as [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]]), a [[file manager]] (such as [[GNOME Files|Files]] or [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]), a set of [[Skin (computing)|graphical themes]], together with [[Widget toolkit|toolkits]] (such as [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]) and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.\n\nSome window managers{{mdashb}}such as [[IceWM]], [[Fluxbox]], [[Openbox]], [[ROX Desktop]] and [[Window Maker]]{{mdashb}}contain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated [[spatial file manager]], while others like [[evilwm]] and [[wmii]] do not provide such elements. Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. [[KDE]], for example, provides so-called [[KIO]] slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.\n\nIn 1996 the [[KDE]] was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of [[GNOME]]. [[Xfce]] is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996,<ref name=\"Then\">{{citation |url=http://www.slashgear.com/xfce-creator-talks-linux-moblin-netbooks-and-open-source-0633329/ |title=Xfce creator talks Linux, Moblin, netbooks and open-source |last=Then |first=Ewdison |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=[[SlashGear]] |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> and focuses on speed and modularity, just like [[LXDE]] which was started in 2006. A [[comparison of X Window System desktop environments]] demonstrates the differences between environments. [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] were usually seen as dominant solutions, and these are still often installed by default on Linux systems. Each of them offers:\n* To programmers, a set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and [[human interface guidelines]].\n* To translators, a collaboration infrastructure. KDE and GNOME are available in many languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://l10n.kde.org |title=KDE Localization |publisher=L10n.kde.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnome.org/i18n/ |title=GNOME Internationalization |publisher=Gnome.org |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref>\n* To artists, a workspace to share their talents.<ref>{{cite web |author=Link 27&nbsp;Dec Personalized Golf Ball Sign\u00bb |url=http://www.kde-artists.org/ |title=Where life imitates art |publisher=KDE-Artists |date=2011-12-27 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207004157/http://www.kde-artists.org/ |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://art.gnome.org/ |title=GNOME Art: Artwork and Themes |publisher=Art.gnome.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref>\n* To ergonomics specialists, the chance to help simplify the working environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openusability.org/ |title=OpenUsability |publisher=OpenUsability |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref><ref>[http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/ GNOME Human Interface Guidelines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201211856/http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/ |date=February 1, 2004 }}</ref><ref>[http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/ui/ KDE User Interface Guidelines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040106212356/http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/ui/ |date=January 6, 2004 }}</ref>\n* To developers of third-party applications, a reference environment for integration.

Although striving for broadly similar goals, GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomics. KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate, is highly customizable, and contains many complex features, all whilst trying to establish sensible defaults. GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive, and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplification. Accordingly, each one attracts a different user and developer community. Technically, there are numerous technologies common to all Unix-like desktop environments, most obviously the [[X Window System]]. Accordingly, the [[freedesktop.org]] project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effort.\n\nAs GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers, users of less powerful or older computers often prefer alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance systems. Most commonly used lightweight desktop environments include [[LXDE]] and [[Xfce]]; they both use [[GTK+]], which is the same underlying toolkit GNOME uses. The [[MATE (software)|MATE]] desktop environment, a fork of GNOME&nbsp;2, is comparable to Xfce in its use of RAM and processor cycles, but is often considered more as an alternative to other lightweight desktop environments.\n\nFor a while, GNOME and KDE enjoyed the status of the most popular Linux desktop environments; later, other desktop environments grew in popularity. In April 2011, GNOME introduced a new interface concept with its [[GNOME 3|version 3]], while a popular Linux distribution [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] introduced its own new desktop environment, [[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]. Some users preferred to keep the traditional interface concept of [[GNOME 2]], resulting in the creation of [[MATE (software)|MATE]] as a GNOME&nbsp;2 fork.<ref>Thorsten Leemhuis (usinglinux1173.blogspot.com), August 5, 2012: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190415104204/https://usinglinux1173.blogspot.com/2019/04/common-desktop-features.html Comment: Desktop Fragmentation]</ref>\n\n== Examples of desktop environments ==\nThe most common desktop environment on personal computers is [[Microsoft Windows]]' built-in interface. It was titled [[Luna (theme)|Luna]] in [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Aero|Aero]] in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], [[Metro (design language)|Metro]] in [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 8.1|8.1]], and [[Fluent Design System|Fluent]] in [[Windows 10]]. Also common is [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]], included with Apple's [[macOS]].\n\nMainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems use the X Window System, and include [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]], and [[LXDE]], any of which may be selected by users and are not tied exclusively to the operating system in use.\n\nA number of other desktop environments also exist, including (but not limited to) [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]], [[Equinox Desktop Environment|EDE]], [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]], [[IRIX Interactive Desktop]], Sun's [[Java Desktop System]], [[Jesktop]], [[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]], [[Project Looking Glass]], [[ROX Desktop]], [[UDE]], [[Xito]], [[XFast]]. Moreover, there exists [[FVWM-Crystal]], which consists of a powerful configuration for the [[FVWM]] window manager, a theme and further adds, altogether forming a \"construction kit\" for building up a desktop environment.\n\n[[X window manager]]s that are meant to be usable stand-alone \u2014 without another desktop environment \u2014 also include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments, most prominently [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Other examples include [[OpenBox]], [[Fluxbox]], [[WindowLab]], [[Fvwm]], as well as [[Window Maker]] and [[AfterStep]], which both feature the [[NeXTSTEP]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] look and feel. However newer versions of some operating systems make self configure.\n\nThe [[Amiga]] approach to desktop environment was noteworthy: the original [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] desktop environment in [[AmigaOS]] evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solutions. Some of those descendants are the Scalos,<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris&nbsp;Haynes |url=http://scalos.noname.fr/ |title=Scalos \u2013 The Amiga Desktop Replacement |publisher=Scalos.noname.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> the [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]] desktop of [[MorphOS]], and the [[Wanderer (AROS)|Wanderer]] desktop of the [[AROS]] open source OS. WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga UI. Third-party [[Directory Opus]] software, which was originally just a [[navigational file manager]] program, evolved to become a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magellan.\n\nThere is the [[Workplace Shell]] that runs on IBM [[OS/2]] or [[eComStation]].\n\nThe [[BumpTop]] project is an experimental desktop environment. Its main objective is to replace the 2D paradigm with a \"real-world\" 3D implementation, where documents can be freely manipulated across a virtual table.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n{{See also|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"110px\">\nFile:AmbientDesktop.png|[[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]]\nFile:Budgie Desktop Environment.png|[[Budgie (desktop environment)|Budgie]]\nFile:CDE 2012 on Linux.png|[[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]]\nFile:Cinnamon 4.2.3 screenshot.png|[[Cinnamon (Desktop Environment)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:Deepin Screenshot.png|[[Deepin|Deepin DE]]\nFile:102shot xft1.png|[[Equinox Desktop Environment|EDE]]\nFile:Elokab-full-01.png|[http://sourceforge.net/projects/elokab/ Elokab]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Etoiledock.png|[[\u00c9toil\u00e9]]\nFile:GNOME 3.32.1.png|[[GNOME Shell]]\nFile:Gnustep.png|[[GNUstep]]\nFile:InnovaDE Kids V 0.1.3.png|[http://sourceforge.net/projects/innovadesktop/ Innova]\nFile:KDE Plasma 5.16.png|[[KDE Plasma 5]]\nFile:Liri Shell.png|[https://github.com/lirios/shell Liri Shell]\nFile:Lumina1.0.0-TrueOS.png|[[Lumina (desktop environment)|Lumina]]\nFile:LXDE desktop full.png|[[LXDE]]\nFile:LXQt 0.10 - Ambiance.png|[[LXQt]]\nFile:Ubuntu Mate 18.04.1 with MATE 1.20.1.png|[[MATE (software)|MATE]]\nFile:MaXX.png|[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234856/http://www.maxxinteractive.com/ MaXX]\nFile:Maynard desktop.png|[[Maynard (software)|Maynard]]\nFile:Symphonyosb1pr1.png|[[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]]\nFile:Bodhi-2016-10-29.png|[http://www.bodhilinux.com/moksha-desktop/ Moksha]\nFile:Elementary OS 5.1 Hera.png|[[Elementary (operating system)|Pantheon]]\nFile:LG3D memo board.jpeg|[[Project Looking Glass]]\nFile:Razor desktop.png|[[Razor-qt]]\nFile:Rox-desktop-2004.png|[[ROX Desktop]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]\nFile:TheShell.png|[https://vicr123.github.io/theshell/ theShell]\nFile:Screenshot of Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) R14.0.5 Development.png|[[Trinity (desktop environment)|Trinity]]\nFile:X-Window-System.png|[[twm]]\n\nFile:Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]\nFile:Vera Desktop.png|[https://github.com/vera-desktop/vera vera]\nFile:Wmaker-0.80.2.png|[[Window Maker]]\nFile:XFCE-4.12-Desktop-standard.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:Zorin OS 15.png|[[Zorin|Zorin OS]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] \u2013 an alternative to X Windows which can run several different desktop environments\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{X desktop environments and window managers}}\n{{Operating system}}\n\n[[Category:Desktop environments| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toZorin(link changed toZorin OS) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment"}

Initially with no political agenda, it became politicized by several leaders and factions and mounted the [[Young Turk Revolution]] against Abdul Hamid II in 1908. However, Abdullah Cevdet cut his ties with the CUP soon after 1908, instead promoting his [[Secularism|secular]] ideas.
