The song was never played live by the band until Kiss Kruise VII in November 2017.\n\n'''\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"'''\n\nThe title song has been played on every Kiss tour since its release. Stanley has cited it as one of his favorite Kiss songs. It was the first song that Stanley wrote, arranged and produced in its entirety.<ref name=\"leaf\">Leaf, David and Ken Sharp.

Side B was completely out of order.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Kiss-Love-Gun/release/5077849</ref>\n\n''Love Gun'' was remastered and reissued in 1997 as part of the Kiss Remasters series.\n\nIt was remastered and reissued again in a deluxe edition on October 28, 2014, with [[liner notes|sleeve notes]] by [[Def Leppard]]'s [[Joe Elliott]] and a second disc containing demos, live rarities and a 1977 interview with Gene Simmons. All tracks on the second disc were previously unreleased, bar the demo of \"Reputation\", which had appeared on the compilation ''[[Kiss 40]]'' a few months earlier.

Fighting at [[welterweight]] during the 1970s and 1980s, Mayweather Sr. was known for his defensive abilities and overall knowledge of boxing strategy. He is the father, and former trainer, of undefeated five-division boxing champion [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]]\n\n==Boxing career==\nYounger brother [[Roger Mayweather|Roger]] was WBC super featherweight and super lightweight champion and was known for his defensive skills. The youngest brother, [[Jeff Mayweather|Jeff]], held the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] super featherweight title.  Floyd Mayweather Sr. is known for his outspokenness. He frequently recites poetry about his opponent and still does today for his fighter's opponent. Some refer to him as the \"poet laureate of boxing.\" He is a flamboyant dresser who wears colorful suits, ties and shoes to news conferences.\n\nMayweather Sr.'s boxing record was 28\u20136\u20131 (18 KOs), and he won the U.S. Championship Tournament in 1977 against Miguel Barreto.<ref>{{boxrec|id=15480}}</ref>  Mayweather Sr. suffers from the lung disease [[sarcoidosis]].<ref>Iole, Kevin. (November 25, 2008) [https://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-boxmailbag112508&prov=yhoo&type=lgns Mailbag: Floyd Sr. faces a different foe \u2013 Boxing \u2013 Yahoo! Sports]. Sports.yahoo.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-28.</ref> Floyd Mayweather Sr. taught Mayweather Jr. to punch when he was still a toddler in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. When Mayweather Jr. was a year old, his maternal uncle shot Floyd Sr. in the leg. Prior to his breakup with his son [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], he served as his manager.\n\n=== Trainer ===\nAs a trainer, Mayweather preaches defense and a stiff jab. He teaches many of his boxers a defensive technique known as the shoulder roll, in which the fighter uses his front shoulder to deflect blows and limit their impact. He has on many occasions, including HBO's ''Mayweather-Hatton 24/7'', claimed to be \"Floyd Joy Mayweather Sr., 'The Greatest Trainer of All Time'\".\n\nHe is the former trainer of top light heavyweight [[Chad Dawson]], former two division champion [[Joan Guzm\u00e1n]] and women's champion [[Laila Ali]]. He is well known for his stint as [[Oscar De La Hoya]]'s trainer from 2001 through 2006. He said he would train De La Hoya for his May 5, 2007, fight against his son, but demanded a $2 million fee to do so. After considerable deliberation, De La Hoya opted not to hire Mayweather Sr. and announced on January 30, 2007, he would use [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] instead.\n\nThe snub briefly reunited father and son, with Floyd Sr. turning up at the Mayweather Jr. boxing gym, while Roger (who had been banned from being in the corner at boxing matches for 12 months for starting a riot during Floyd Jr.'s bout against [[Zab Judah]] on April 8, 2006, when he attacked Judah) served six months in jail for a domestic assault. But when Roger was released, the situation became awkward because of the brothers\u2019 rivalry. He also spent five years in a federal prison for convictions for violating drug trafficking laws.\n\nFloyd Jr. chose Roger as his trainer and Floyd Sr. left again, claiming that the father-son relationship was \"back to square one\" for choosing Roger over his own father again. Floyd Sr. agreed to once again train De La Hoya in anticipation for Mayweather Jr. \u2013 De La Hoya II presented by [[Golden Boy Promotions]]. However, due to disagreements with how revenues would be divided amongst the two fighters, the bout was cancelled. Mayweather Sr. trained [[Manchester]]'s [[Ricky Hatton]] for seven weeks prior to his bout against [[Paulie Malignaggi]] on November 22, 2008 at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas.\n\nHatton retained his [[International Boxing Organisation|IBO]] light welterweight title with a technical knockout in the 11th round. However, Hatton lost only his second fight under Mayweather Sr. with a second-round knockout by [[Manny Pacquiao]]. The famous feud between Floyd Mayweather Sr. and Floyd Mayweather Jr. finally came to an end as father and son made up before Jr.'s return to the ring after a 21-month lay off. However Jr.'s uncle Roger Mayweather still trains Jr. On the HBO 24/7 program Floyd Mayweather Sr. was quoted as saying 'I don't need to train my son, I need a relationship with my son.\"\n\nA proposed March 2010 fight between Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao fell by the wayside in January 2010 when the camps representing both fighters could not agree on a timeline for drug testing for the fight. A more stringent drug test was sought by Mayweather Jr.'s representatives due to inadequacies in the current testing standards and a suspicion that Pacquiao might be utilizing banned performance enhancers in his training regimen. Mayweather Sr. had been very vocal about his theory that Manny Pacquiao's impressive displays as a welterweight were aided by performance-enhancing drugs for several months prior to the negotiation for a fight between his son and Pacquiao.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.directorslive.com/video/2307/Floyd-Mayweather-picks-Cotto-over-roided-Pacquiao |title=Floyd Mayweather picks Cotto over roided Pacquiao |accessdate=2010-01-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317211916/http://www.directorslive.com/video/2307/Floyd-Mayweather-picks-Cotto-over-roided-Pacquiao |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}. directorslive.com</ref> On March 21, 2011, U.S. District Judge Larry Hicks said Pacquiao had sufficient evidence to continue his lawsuit that alleged Floyd Sr., Floyd Jr., and Roger acted with malice by accusing the Filipino boxer, and as of December 2011 Jr had been deposed and the case was continuing seeking damages of $10 million.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=6244917 Manny Pacquiao suit moves forward].

Ringside Report (January 8, 2011). Retrieved on 2011-11-28.</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, for the first time in 13 years, Floyd Jr. announced that Floyd Sr. would return as his trainer against Robert Guerrero. While some speculated this was because of the bloody nose Jr. got in an otherwise dominant performance against Miguel Cotto (a change to the more defensive oriented Floyd Sr. over the offensive Roger was seen as logical), Floyd Jr. cited his uncle Roger's health issues, diabetes, and poor vision as rationale for the change. Sr. has remained the trainer of Jr. ever since and trained him to victory in his fight over [[Manny Pacquiao]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/3857/mayweather-jr-and-sr-reunite Mayweather Jr. and Sr. reunite \u2013 Dan Rafael Blog \u2013 ESPN].

[[professional boxer]] who competed from 1974 to 1990, and has since worked as a [[boxing trainer]]. Fighting at [[welterweight]] during the 1970s and 1980s, Mayweather Sr. was known for his defensive abilities and overall knowledge of boxing strategy. He is the father, and former trainer, of undefeated five-division boxing champion [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]]\n\n==Boxing career==\nYounger brother [[Roger Mayweather|Roger]] was WBC super featherweight and super lightweight champion and was known for his defensive skills. The youngest brother, [[Jeff Mayweather|Jeff]], held the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] super featherweight title.  Floyd Mayweather Sr. is known for his outspokenness. He frequently recites poetry about his opponent and still does today for his fighter's opponent. Some refer to him as the \"poet laureate of boxing.\" He is a flamboyant dresser who wears colorful suits, ties and shoes to news conferences.\n\nMayweather Sr.'s boxing record was 28\u20136\u20131 (18 KOs), and he won the U.S. Championship Tournament in 1977 against Miguel Barreto.<ref>{{boxrec|id=15480}}</ref>  Mayweather Sr. suffers from the lung disease [[sarcoidosis]].<ref>Iole, Kevin. (November 25, 2008) [https://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-boxmailbag112508&prov=yhoo&type=lgns Mailbag: Floyd Sr. faces a different foe \u2013 Boxing \u2013 Yahoo! Sports]. Sports.yahoo.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-28.</ref> Floyd Mayweather Sr. taught Mayweather Jr. to punch when he was still a toddler in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. When Mayweather Jr. was a year old, his maternal uncle shot Floyd Sr. in the leg. Prior to his breakup with his son [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], he served as his manager.\n\n=== Trainer ===\nAs a trainer, Mayweather preaches defense and a stiff jab. He teaches many of his boxers a defensive technique known as the shoulder roll, in which the fighter uses his front shoulder to deflect blows and limit their impact. He has on many occasions, including HBO's ''Mayweather-Hatton 24/7'', claimed to be \"Floyd Joy Mayweather Sr., 'The Greatest Trainer of All Time'\".\n\nHe is the former trainer of top light heavyweight [[Chad Dawson]], former two division champion [[Joan Guzm\u00e1n]] and women's champion [[Laila Ali]]. He is well known for his stint as [[Oscar De La Hoya]]'s trainer from 2001 through 2006. He said he would train De La Hoya for his May 5, 2007, fight against his son, but demanded a $2 million fee to do so. After considerable deliberation, De La Hoya opted not to hire Mayweather Sr. and announced on January 30, 2007, he would use [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] instead.\n\nThe snub briefly reunited father and son, with Floyd Sr. turning up at the Mayweather Jr. boxing gym, while Roger (who had been banned from being in the corner at boxing matches for 12 months for starting a riot during Floyd Jr.'s bout against [[Zab Judah]] on April 8, 2006, when he attacked Judah) served six months in jail for a domestic assault. But when Roger was released, the situation became awkward because of the brothers\u2019 rivalry. He also spent five years in a federal prison for convictions for violating drug trafficking laws.\n\nFloyd Jr. chose Roger as his trainer and Floyd Sr. left again, claiming that the father-son relationship was \"back to square one\" for choosing Roger over his own father again. Floyd Sr. agreed to once again train De La Hoya in anticipation for Mayweather Jr. \u2013 De La Hoya II presented by [[Golden Boy Promotions]]. However, due to disagreements with how revenues would be divided amongst the two fighters, the bout was cancelled. Mayweather Sr. trained [[Manchester]]'s [[Ricky Hatton]] for seven weeks prior to his bout against [[Paulie Malignaggi]] on November 22, 2008 at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas.\n\nHatton retained his [[International Boxing Organisation|IBO]] light welterweight title with a technical knockout in the 11th round. However, Hatton lost only his second fight under Mayweather Sr. with a second-round knockout by [[Manny Pacquiao]]. The famous feud between Floyd Mayweather Sr. and Floyd Mayweather Jr. finally came to an end as father and son made up before Jr.'s return to the ring after a 21-month lay off. However Jr.'s uncle Roger Mayweather still trains Jr. On the HBO 24/7 program Floyd Mayweather Sr. was quoted as saying 'I don't need to train my son, I need a relationship with my son.\"\n\nA proposed March 2010 fight between Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao fell by the wayside in January 2010 when the camps representing both fighters could not agree on a timeline for drug testing for the fight. A more stringent drug test was sought by Mayweather Jr.'s representatives due to inadequacies in the current testing standards and a suspicion that Pacquiao might be utilizing banned performance enhancers in his training regimen. Mayweather Sr. had been very vocal about his theory that Manny Pacquiao's impressive displays as a welterweight were aided by performance-enhancing drugs for several months prior to the negotiation for a fight between his son and Pacquiao.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.directorslive.com/video/2307/Floyd-Mayweather-picks-Cotto-over-roided-Pacquiao |title=Floyd Mayweather picks Cotto over roided Pacquiao |accessdate=2010-01-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317211916/http://www.directorslive.com/video/2307/Floyd-Mayweather-picks-Cotto-over-roided-Pacquiao |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}. directorslive.com</ref> On March 21, 2011, U.S. District Judge Larry Hicks said Pacquiao had sufficient evidence to continue his lawsuit that alleged Floyd Sr., Floyd Jr., and Roger acted with malice by accusing the Filipino boxer, and as of December 2011 Jr had been deposed and the case was continuing seeking damages of $10 million.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=6244917 Manny Pacquiao suit moves forward].

Ringside Report (January 8, 2011). Retrieved on 2011-11-28.</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, for the first time in 13 years, Floyd Jr. announced that Floyd Sr. would return as his trainer against Robert Guerrero. While some speculated this was because of the bloody nose Jr. got in an otherwise dominant performance against Miguel Cotto (a change to the more defensive oriented Floyd Sr. over the offensive Roger was seen as logical), Floyd Jr. cited his uncle Roger's health issues, diabetes, and poor vision as rationale for the change. Sr. has remained the trainer of Jr. ever since and trained him to victory in his fight over [[Manny Pacquiao]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/3857/mayweather-jr-and-sr-reunite Mayweather Jr. and Sr. reunite \u2013 Dan Rafael Blog \u2013 ESPN].
