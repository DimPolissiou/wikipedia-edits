The workers in this program carry out nearly 1/3 of all confirmed malaria diagnoses in the country, have identified over 4,000 potential epidemic events, improved vaccination coverage, improved skill birth attendance, and increased the rate of children receiving medical care by over 50% in Liberia's most remote communities.<ref>https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/</ref> As of 2019, through service, research and advocacy efforts, Last Mile Health has supported local partners working to strengthen rural frontline and community health workforces in nearly 10 countries across three continents.<ref> 2019-annual-report.lastmilehealth.org </ref>\n\nIn 2017, Panjabi and Last Mile Health received the $1 million TED Prize to launch the Community Health Academy, a global platform leveraging the power of digital technology to support countries to modernize the training of community health workers and health systems leaders.<ref name=\"ted.com\">https://www.ted.com/talks/raj_panjabi_no_one_should_die_because_they_live_too_far_from_a_doctor</ref> In collaboration with several partners and governments, the Community Health Academy has launched online and mobile courses for frontline health leaders and workers seeking to strengthen primary health care at the community level.

The study indicated that, in one of Liberia's most remote districts, professionalized CHWs coached by nurses significantly improved access to care from qualified providers for children suffering from [[diarrhea]], [[malaria]], and [[acute respiratory infection]] \u2013 increasing by 60.1, 30.6 and 51.2 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.

The study indicated that, in one of Liberia's most remote districts, professionalized CHWs coached by nurses significantly improved access to care from qualified providers for children suffering from [[diarrhea]], [[malaria]], and [[acute respiratory infection]] \u2013 increasing by 60.1, 30.6 and 51.2 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.
