When Atsushi debuted as the vocalist of [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] later on, Imaichi quickly became a big fan of the group and learned to sing their songs.

When Atsushi debuted as the vocalist of [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] later on, Imaichi quickly became a big fan of the group and learned to sing their songs. However, he did not initially have the dream of becoming a singer. In 2006, his then girlfriend encouraged him to participate in the ''Vocal Battle Audition 2006: Asian Dream'', an audition to find a new vocalist for Exile.

As he turned 24 that year, he considered this chance as the last try for his dream to become a professional singer. He passed the first round and met [[Hiroomi Tosaka]] in the second round. They considered each other to be strong competitors after seeing their performances for the first round on Sh\u00fbkan Exile's coverage of the audition. As Imaichi and Tosaka both were selected as two of the ten finalists after the third round, it was announced that the two winners of ''Vocal Battle Audition 2'' would become the vocalists of the new dance and vocal group [[Sandaime J Soul Brothers]]. On September 15, 2010, the final round of the audition was held at [[Akasaka Blitz]] music venue and Imaichi won the audition alongside [[Hiroomi Tosaka]].

The lottery winner would get the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first selection]] in the draft. A '''lottery pick''' denotes a draft pick whose position is determined through the lottery, while a non-playoff team involved in the process is often called a '''lottery team'''.\n\nUnder the current rules, only the top four picks are decided by the lottery, and are chosen from the 14 teams that do not make the playoffs. The team with the worst record, or the team that holds the draft rights of the team with the worst record, has the best chance to obtain a higher draft pick. After the top four positions are selected (from the lottery slotting system), the remainder of the first-round draft order is in inverse order of the win-loss record for the remaining teams, or the teams who originally held the lottery rights if they were traded. The lottery does not determine the draft order in the subsequent rounds of the draft.\n\nBeginning with the 2019 draft, the NBA changed the lottery odds (the bottom three teams will all have an equal 14% chance of winning the top pick) and increased the number of teams selected in the lottery from three to four.\n\n==History==\n\n===1947\u20131965: Territorial picks===\n{{further|NBA territorial pick}}\nIn the earlier drafts, the teams would draft in reverse order of their win-loss record. However, a special [[NBA territorial pick|territorial-pick]] rule allowed a team to draft a player from its local area. If a team decided to use its territorial pick, it forfeited its first-round pick in the draft.<ref name=\"Inside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/features/inside_lottery_050524.html|title=Let the Ping-Pong Balls Fall|last=Dengate|first=Jeff|date=May 16, 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2009|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68Oj2mcnc?url=http://www.nba.com/features/inside_lottery_050524.html|archive-date=June 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1966\u20131984: Coin flip===\nIn 1966, the NBA revamped its draft system, and introduced a coin flip between the worst teams in each conference to determine who would obtain the first overall draft pick.

The worst non-playoff team that season would have 11 chances, out of 66, to obtain the first pick. The second worst would have 10 chances, and so on. Similarly to the previous system, the weighted lottery system was also used only to determine the first three picks, while the rest of the teams selected in reverse order of their win-loss records.\n\nDespite the weighted odds, the [[Orlando Magic]] managed to win the lottery in [[1993 NBA draft|1993]] with only one chance to obtain the first pick as it was the best non-playoff team in the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|previous season]]. In October 1993, the NBA modified the lottery system to give the team with the worst record a higher chance to win the draft lottery and to decrease the better teams' chances to win. The new system increased the chances of the worst team obtaining the first pick in the draft from 16.7 percent to 25 percent, while decreasing the chances of the best non-playoff team from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent.\n\nIn the new system, 14 numbered [[table tennis]] balls were used. Then, a four-number combination from the 14 balls were drawn to determine the lottery winner. Prior to the draft, the NBA assigns 1,000 possible combinations to the non-playoff teams (the 11\u201312\u201313\u201314 combination is ignored and redrawn). The process was then repeated to determine the second and third pick.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> The table below shows the lottery chances and the probabilities for each team to win the first pick in the weighted lottery system in 1993 and 1994 draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajur.uni.edu/v2n3/Florke%20&%20Ecker.pdf|title=NBA Draft Lottery Probabilities|last=Florke|first=Chad R.|author2=Ecker, Mark D.|date=December 1, 2003|accessdate=August 22, 2009|format=PDF|work=|publisher=University of Northern Iowa}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the NBA Board of Governors voted on a proposed reform to the lottery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lottery Reform Vote Set to Pass?|url=http://www.basketballinsiders.com/lottery-reform-vote-set-to-pass/|website=basketballinsiders.com}}</ref> If the proposed changes passed, the four worst teams in the league would have been given identical odds (around 11 percent) at winning the top pick.

Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick.<ref>http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/dikembe-mutombo-tweet-nba-draft-lottery-rigged-76ers-sixers-philadelphia-051716</ref> Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly the same as it was before the event took place, which was the first occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive [[Magic Johnson]] raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach [[Luke Walton]] that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the [[2017 NBA draft]] after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick.<ref>https://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/4/15543124/luke-walton-magic-johnson-draft-pick-lakers</ref>\n\nIn response to teams like the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] deliberately seeking high-loss season records in order to improve their draft odds, beginning with the [[2019 NBA draft]] the NBA implemented a new lottery system giving the worst three teams equal odds at the first overall pick and expanding the lottery to the top four picks (up from the top three picks). As with the changes proposed in 2014, these changes were intended to disincentivize high-loss seasons by flattening the odds of getting the top pick and increasing the likelihood of the worst teams having to pick later in the draft.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|\n! colspan=\"4\" |1993 draft lottery\n!rowspan=\"13\"|\n! colspan=\"4\" |1994 draft lottery\n|-\n!Team!![[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993<br>record]]!!Chances<br>(out of 66)!!Probability\n!Team!![[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u20131994<br>record]]!!Chances<br>(out of 1000)!!Probability\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1\n|align=\"left\"|[[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]]\n|11\u201371||11||16.67%\n|align=\"left\"|Dallas\n|13\u201369||250||25.00%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2\n|align=\"left\"|[[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minnesota]]\n|19\u201363||10||15.15%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]]\n|20\u201362||164||16.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|3\n|align=\"left\"|[[Washington Wizards|Washington]]\n|22\u201360||9||13.64%\n|align=\"left\"|Minnesota\n|20\u201362||164||16.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|4\n|align=\"left\"|[[Sacramento Kings|Sacramento]]\n|25\u201357||8||12.12%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Milwaukee Bucks|Milwaukee]]\n|20\u201362||163||16.30%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|5\n|align=\"left\"|[[Philadelphia 76ers|Philadelphia]]\n|26\u201356||7||10.61%\n|align=\"left\"|Washington\n|24\u201358||94||9.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|6\n|align=\"left\"|Milwaukee\n|28\u201354||6||9.09%\n|align=\"left\"|Philadelphia\n|25\u201357||66||6.60%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|7\n|align=\"left\"|[[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]]\n|34\u201348||5||7.58%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Los Angeles Clippers|L.A.

Just as in most traditional lotteries, the order in which the numbers are drawn is not important. That is, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 is considered to be the same as 4\u20133\u20132\u20131. There are a total of 1,001 [[combination]]s (or (14x13x12x11) / (4x3x2x1)). Of these combinations, one outcome is disregarded and the remaining outcomes are distributed among the 14 non-playoff NBA teams.  The combination 11\u201312\u201313\u201314 (in any order that those numbers are drawn) is not assigned and is ignored if drawn; this has never occurred in practice.\n\nIn the event a lottery pick is traded to another team, the record of the original team (whose pick it was before the trade) still determines eligibility for the lottery, and assignment of chances.\n\n=== 2005 ===\nSince 2005, with 30 NBA teams, 16 qualify for the playoffs and the remaining 14 teams enter in the draft lottery.

In 2007, the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] tied for the sixth worst record. The average of the 6th and 7th positions in the lottery was taken, resulting in each team getting 53 combinations (the average of 63 and 43).  Should the average number not be an [[integer]], a coin flip is then used to determine which team or teams receive the extra combination.  The result of the coin flip is also used to determine who receives the earlier pick in the event that neither of the tied teams wins one of the first four picks via the lottery.\n\nThe lottery is conducted with witnesses (from the accounting firm [[Ernst & Young]]) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine the second and third picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. Prior to the 2019 draft, when the first three teams had been determined, the remaining picks were given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assured each team that it could drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.  Beginning with the 2019 draft, the number of combinations drawn is increased from 3 to 4, with the remaining picks still assigned based on regular season record.  A team then drops no more than four spots from its projected position.\n\nIn a case where a lottery team trades its pick to a playoff team, the playoff team assumes the lottery team's position in all draft lottery situations, unless provisioned by the conditions of the trade.\n\n==Lottery ceremony==\n{{See also|National Basketball Association criticisms and controversies}}\n\nThe drawing of the ping-pong balls is conducted in private, though observed by independent auditors and representatives from each team.  The results are subsequently presented in a televised unveiling (formerly broadcast as a short ceremony prior to or during halftime of an NBA playoff game, but since the mid-2010s, presented as an hour-long special by [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]), in which the order of the lottery is announced in reverse order, from the fourteenth selection to the first. Representatives from each NBA franchise with a lottery pick are present at the lottery ceremony.\n\nThe decision of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled speculation that the NBA occasionally fixes the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send the best player in the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used seven envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record.

The NBA Draft lottery started in 1985. In the NBA draft, the teams obtain the rights to amateur U.S. [[college basketball]] players and other [[Eligibility for the NBA draft|eligible players]], including international players. The lottery winner would get the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first selection]] in the draft. The term \"lottery pick\" denotes a draft pick whose position is determined through the lottery, while the non-playoff teams involved in the process are often called \"lottery teams.\"\n\nUnder the current rules, only the top four picks are decided by the lottery, and are chosen from the 14 teams that do not make the playoffs. The team with the worst record, or the team that holds the draft rights of the team with the worst record, has the best chance to obtain a higher draft pick. After the top four positions are selected (from the lottery slotting system), the remainder of the first-round draft order is in inverse order of the win-loss record for the remaining teams, or the teams who originally held the lottery rights if they were traded. The lottery does not determine the draft order in the subsequent rounds of the draft.\n\nBeginning with the 2019 draft, the NBA changed the lottery odds (the bottom three teams will all have an equal 14% chance of winning the top pick) and increased the number of teams selected in the lottery from three to four.\n\n==History==\n\n===1947\u20131965: Territorial picks===\n{{further|NBA territorial pick}}\nIn the earlier drafts, the teams would draft in reverse order of their win-loss record. However, a special [[NBA territorial pick|territorial-pick]] rule allowed a team to draft a player from its local area.

The team who lost the coin flip would get the second pick, and the rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record.\n\nThe coin-flip system gave the worst teams in each conference an equal chance to have the first draft pick, but had a disadvantage  in that the two worst teams overall could be in the same conference; in this situation, the second-worst team overall would have no chance of obtaining the first draft pick.<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\n===1985\u20131989: Early lottery system===\nAfter the [[1984 NBA draft|1984]] coin flip, which was won by the [[Houston Rockets]], the NBA introduced the lottery system to counter the accusations that the Rockets and several other teams were deliberately losing their regular season games in order to secure the worst record and consequently the chance to obtain the first pick.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2005/05/22/2005-05-22_the_draft_that_changed_it_al.html |title=The Draft That Changed It All.

Inside each of the envelopes was the name of a non-playoff team. The team whose envelope was drawn first would get the first pick.

The worst non-playoff team that season would have 11 chances, out of 66, to obtain the first pick. The second worst would have 10 chances, and so on. Similarly to the previous system, the weighted lottery system was also used only to determine the first three picks, while the rest of the teams selected in reverse order of their win-loss records.\n\nDespite the weighted odds, the [[Orlando Magic]] managed to win the lottery in [[1993 NBA draft|1993]] with only one chance to obtain the first pick as it was the best non-playoff team in the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|previous season]]. In October 1993, the NBA modified the lottery system to give the team with the worst record a higher chance to win the draft lottery and to decrease the better teams' chances to win. The new system increased the chances of the worst team obtaining the first pick in the draft from 16.7 percent to 25 percent, while decreasing the chances of the best non-playoff team from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent.\n\nIn the new system, 14 numbered [[table tennis]] balls were used. Then, a four-number combination from the 14 balls were drawn to determine the lottery winner. Prior to the draft, the NBA assigns 1,000 possible combinations to the non-playoff teams (the 11\u201312\u201313\u201314 combination is ignored and redrawn). The process was then repeated to determine the second and third pick.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> The table below shows the lottery chances and the probabilities for each team to win the first pick in the weighted lottery system in 1993 and 1994 draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajur.uni.edu/v2n3/Florke%20&%20Ecker.pdf|title=NBA Draft Lottery Probabilities|last=Florke|first=Chad R.|author2=Ecker, Mark D.|date=December 1, 2003|accessdate=August 22, 2009|format=PDF|work=|publisher=University of Northern Iowa}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the NBA Board of Governors voted on a proposed reform to the lottery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lottery Reform Vote Set to Pass?|url=http://www.basketballinsiders.com/lottery-reform-vote-set-to-pass/|website=basketballinsiders.com}}</ref> If the proposed changes passed, the four worst teams in the league would have been given identical odds (around 11 percent) at winning the top pick.

Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick.<ref>http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/dikembe-mutombo-tweet-nba-draft-lottery-rigged-76ers-sixers-philadelphia-051716</ref> Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly the same as it was before the event took place, which was the first occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive [[Magic Johnson]] raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach [[Luke Walton]] that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the [[2017 NBA draft]] after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick.<ref>https://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/4/15543124/luke-walton-magic-johnson-draft-pick-lakers</ref>\n\nIn response to teams like the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] deliberately seeking high-loss season records in order to improve their draft odds, beginning with the [[2019 NBA draft]] the NBA implemented a new lottery system giving the worst three teams equal odds at the first overall pick and expanding the lottery to the top four picks (up from the top three picks). As with the changes proposed in 2014, these changes were intended to disincentivize high-loss seasons by flattening the odds of getting the top pick and increasing the likelihood of the worst teams having to pick later in the draft.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|\n! colspan=\"4\" |1993 draft lottery\n!rowspan=\"13\"|\n! colspan=\"4\" |1994 draft lottery\n|-\n!Team!![[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993<br>record]]!!Chances<br>(out of 66)!!Probability\n!Team!![[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u20131994<br>record]]!!Chances<br>(out of 1000)!!Probability\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1\n|align=\"left\"|[[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]]\n|11\u201371||11||16.67%\n|align=\"left\"|Dallas\n|13\u201369||250||25.00%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2\n|align=\"left\"|[[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minnesota]]\n|19\u201363||10||15.15%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]]\n|20\u201362||164||16.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|3\n|align=\"left\"|[[Washington Wizards|Washington]]\n|22\u201360||9||13.64%\n|align=\"left\"|Minnesota\n|20\u201362||164||16.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|4\n|align=\"left\"|[[Sacramento Kings|Sacramento]]\n|25\u201357||8||12.12%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Milwaukee Bucks|Milwaukee]]\n|20\u201362||163||16.30%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|5\n|align=\"left\"|[[Philadelphia 76ers|Philadelphia]]\n|26\u201356||7||10.61%\n|align=\"left\"|Washington\n|24\u201358||94||9.40%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|6\n|align=\"left\"|Milwaukee\n|28\u201354||6||9.09%\n|align=\"left\"|Philadelphia\n|25\u201357||66||6.60%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|7\n|align=\"left\"|[[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]]\n|34\u201348||5||7.58%\n|align=\"left\"|[[Los Angeles Clippers|L.A.

The Grizzlies have yet to hold the first selection.\n\n==Process==\nThe lottery is normally held during either the third or fourth week of May.\n\nTo determine the winner, fourteen ping pong balls numbered 1\u201314 are placed in a standard lottery machine and four balls are randomly selected from the lot. Just as in most traditional lotteries, the order in which the numbers are drawn is not important. That is, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 is considered to be the same as 4\u20133\u20132\u20131. There are a total of 1,001 [[combination]]s (or (14x13x12x11) / (4x3x2x1)). Of these combinations, one outcome is disregarded and the remaining outcomes are distributed among the 14 non-playoff NBA teams.  The combination 11\u201312\u201313\u201314 (in any order that those numbers are drawn) is not assigned and is ignored if drawn; this has never occurred in practice.\n\nIn the event a lottery pick is traded to another team, the record of the original team (whose pick it was before the trade) still determines eligibility for the lottery, and assignment of chances.\n\n=== 2005 ===\nSince 2005, with 30 NBA teams, 16 qualify for the playoffs and the remaining 14 teams enter in the draft lottery. These 14 teams were ranked in reverse order of their regular season record and assigned the following number of chances, up to 2018:\n\n# 250 combinations, 25.0% chance of receiving the No. 1 pick\n# 199 combinations, 19.9% chance\n# 156 combinations, 15.6% chance\n# 119 combinations, 11.9% chance\n# 88 combinations, 8.8% chance\n# 63 combinations, 6.3% chance\n# 43 combinations, 4.3% chance\n# 28 combinations, 2.8% chance\n# 17 combinations, 1.7% chance\n# 11 combinations, 1.1% chance\n# 8 combinations, 0.8% chance\n# 7 combinations, 0.7% chance\n# 6 combinations, 0.6% chance\n# 5 combinations, 0.5% chance\n\nThe following table listed the odds for each seed to get specific picks if there were no ties (rounded to 9 decimal places).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2007, the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] tied for the sixth worst record. The average of the 6th and 7th positions in the lottery was taken, resulting in each team getting 53 combinations (the average of 63 and 43).  Should the average number not be an [[integer]], a coin flip is then used to determine which team or teams receive the extra combination.  The result of the coin flip is also used to determine who receives the earlier pick in the event that neither of the tied teams wins one of the first four picks via the lottery.\n\nThe lottery is conducted with witnesses (from the accounting firm [[Ernst & Young]]) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine the second and third picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. Prior to the 2019 draft, when the first three teams had been determined, the remaining picks were given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assured each team that it could drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.  Beginning with the 2019 draft, the number of combinations drawn is increased from 3 to 4, with the remaining picks still assigned based on regular season record.  A team then drops no more than four spots from its projected position.\n\nIn a case where a lottery team trades its pick to a playoff team, the playoff team assumes the lottery team's position in all draft lottery situations, unless provisioned by the conditions of the trade.\n\n==Lottery ceremony==\n{{See also|National Basketball Association criticisms and controversies}}\n\nThe drawing of the ping-pong balls is conducted in private, though observed by independent auditors and representatives from each team.  The results are subsequently presented in a televised unveiling (formerly broadcast as a short ceremony prior to or during halftime of an NBA playoff game, but since the mid-2010s, presented as an hour-long special by [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]), in which the order of the lottery is announced in reverse order, from the fourteenth selection to the first. Representatives from each NBA franchise with a lottery pick are present at the lottery ceremony.\n\nThe decision of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled speculation that the NBA occasionally fixes the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send the best player in the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used seven envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record.

Compared with [[floppy disk]]s or [[Compact disc|CDs]], they are smaller, faster, have significantly more capacity, and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts.  Additionally, they are immune to [[electromagnetic interference]] (unlike floppy disks), and are unharmed by surface scratches (unlike CDs). Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the \"1.44 megabyte\" (1440 [[kibibyte]]) 3.5-inch floppy disk.\n\nUSB flash drives use the [[USB mass storage device class]] standard, supported natively by modern [[operating system]]s such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], {{nowrap|[[macOS]]}} and other [[Unix-like]] systems, as well as many [[BIOS]] boot ROMs. USB drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives and can be read by many other systems such as the [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]], DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, though the electronically similar [[SD card]] is better suited for those devices.\n\nA flash drive consists of a small [[printed circuit board]] carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberized case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting into the body of the drive, although it is not likely to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a [[portable media player]] with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.<!-- There are more devices than just this, TomTom ONE for example.  I wonder if specific products (e.g., music player) should be included --><!-- From the article for Kingston -->\n\n==History==\nThe basis for USB flash drives is [[flash memory]], a type of [[floating-gate]] [[semiconductor memory]] invented by [[Fujio Masuoka]] in the early 1980s.

The memory storage was based on earlier [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] technologies. These had limited capacity, were slow for both reading and writing, required complex high-voltage drive circuitry, and could be re-written only after erasing the entire contents of the chip.\n\nHardware designers later developed EEPROMs with the erasure region broken up into smaller \"fields\" that could be erased individually without affecting the others. Altering the contents of a particular memory location involved copying the entire field into an off-chip buffer memory, erasing the field, modifying the data as required in the buffer, and re-writing it into the same field. This required considerable computer support, and PC-based EEPROM flash memory systems often carried their own dedicated microprocessor system. Flash drives are more or less a miniaturized version of this.\n\nThe development of high-speed serial data interfaces such as [[USB]] made semiconductor memory systems with serially accessed storage viable, and the simultaneous development of small, high-speed, low-power microprocessor systems allowed this to be incorporated into extremely compact systems. Serial access requires far fewer electrical connections for the memory chips than does [[Random-access memory|parallel access]], which has simplified the manufacture of multi-[[gigabyte]] drives.\n\nComputers access {{as of|2009|alt=modern}} flash memory systems very much like hard disk drives, where the [[Flash memory controller|controller system]] has full control over where information is actually stored. The actual EEPROM writing and erasure processes are, however, still very similar to the earlier systems described above.\n\nMany low-cost [[MP3 player]]s simply add extra software and a battery to a standard flash memory control microprocessor so it can also serve as a music playback decoder. Most of these players can also be used as a conventional flash drive, for storing files of any type.\n\n===Essential components===\n[[File:Kingston DataTraveler flash drive disassembled.jpg|thumb|The internal mechanical and electronic parts of a Kingston 2&nbsp;GB flash drive]]\nThere are typically five parts to a flash drive:\n\n* Standard-A USB plug{{snd}} provides a physical interface to the host computer. Some USB flash drives use USB plug that does not protect the 4 contacts, with the possibility of plugging it into the USB port the other way around.\n* USB mass storage controller{{snd}} a small [[microcontroller]] with a small amount of on-chip [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and [[Random Access Memory|RAM]].\n* [[NAND flash]] memory chip(s){{snd}} stores data (NAND flash is typically also used in [[digital camera]]s).\n* [[Crystal oscillator]]{{snd}} produces the device's main 12&nbsp;MHz [[clock signal]] and controls the device's data output through a [[phase-locked loop]].\n* Cover{{snd}} typically made of plastic or metal, protecting the electronics against mechanical stress and even possible short circuits.\n\n===Additional components===\nThe typical device may also include:\n\n[[File:USB flash drive2.jpg|thumb|right|The front and rear side of a USB flash drive with the casing removed]]\n\n* [[Jumper (computing)|Jumpers]] and test pins \u2013 for testing during the flash drive's manufacturing or loading code into its [[microcontroller]].\n* [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] \u2013 indicate data transfers or data reads and writes.\n* [[write protection|Write-protect]] switches \u2013 Enable or disable writing of data into memory.\n* Unpopulated space \u2013 provides space to include a second memory chip. Having this second space allows the manufacturer to use a single printed circuit board for more than one storage size device.\n* USB connector cover or cap \u2013 reduces the risk of damage, prevents the entry of dirt or other contaminants, and improves overall device appearance. Some flash drives use retractable USB connectors instead. Others have a swivel arrangement so that the connector can be protected without removing anything.\n* Transport aid \u2013 the cap or the body often contains a hole suitable for connection to a [[key chain]] or [[lanyard]]. Connecting the cap, rather than the body, can allow the drive itself to be lost.\n* Some drives offer expandable storage via an internal [[memory card]] slot, much like a memory [[card reader]].<ref>[http://www.ces-show.com/2006/review/pny/pny_usb_flash_drive.html PNY USB Flash Drive \u2013 CES 2006 \u2013 LetsGoDigital].

However, because a flash drive appears as a USB-connected [[hard drive]] to the host system, the drive can be [[Disk formatting|reformatted]] to any file system supported by the host operating system.\n\n; Defragmenting\n: Flash drives can be [[defragmentation|defragmented]]. There is a widespread opinion that defragmenting brings little advantage (as there is no mechanical head that moves from fragment to fragment), and that defragmenting shortens the life of the drive by making many unnecessary writes.<ref>[http://ask-leo.com/should_i_defragment_my_usb_flash_drive.html Should I defragment my USB Flash drive?].

Some USB flash drives have this '[[wear leveling]]' feature built into the software controller to prolong device life, while others do not, so it is not necessarily helpful to install one of these file systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/nand/tn2942_nand_wear_leveling.pdf|title=TN-29-42: Wear-Leveling Techniques in NAND Flash Devices<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322130027/http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/nand/tn2942_nand_wear_leveling.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Note: Please don't add JFFS or YAFFS references to this article. While these two file systems, designed to minimize the inherent weaknesses of flash memory (e.g., memory wear), can be used on a flash drive, they provide no significant benefit. These filesystems are intended to assist with directly addressed flash memory (e.g. SmartMedia through a raw reader). A flash drive's memory layout is abstracted from the host system in the USB mass storage class, and the flash drive's controller chip performs tasks similar to those JFFS and YAFFS are intended for.  -->\n; Hard disk drive\n: Sectors are 512 bytes long, for compatibility with hard disk drives, and the first sector can contain a [[master boot record]] and a [[partition table]]. Therefore, USB flash units can be partitioned just like hard disk drives.\n\n===Longevity===\nThe memory in flash drives is commonly engineered with [[multi-level cell]] (MLC) based memory that is good for around 3,000-5,000 program-erase cycles,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/5734/kingston-hyperx-3k-240gb-ssd-review |title=Kingston HyperX 3K (240GB) SSD Review |publisher=Anandtec.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> but some flash drives have [[single-level cell]] (SLC) based memory that is good for around 100,000 writes. There is virtually no limit to the number of reads from such flash memory, so a well-worn USB drive may be write-protected to help ensure the life of individual cells. <!-- This may be wrong: some say SSDs, which use the same flash memory, lose their data after 12 months if left unpowered.  <-- I've never seen or heard of that. -->\n\nEstimation of flash memory endurance is a challenging subject that depends on the [[Single-level cell|SLC]]/[[Multi-level cell|MLC]]/[[Triple-level cell|TLC]] memory type, size of the flash memory chips, and actual usage pattern. As a result, a USB flash drive can last from a few days to several hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.bowtiepromotions.com/2013/04/how-long-does-a-usb-flash-drive-last-part-ii/|title=How Long Does a USB Flash Drive Last?

These are typically low capacity USB drives whose flash memory controller [[firmware]] is modified so that they emulate larger capacity drives (for example, a 2&nbsp;GB drive being marketed as a 64&nbsp;GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report themselves as being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data.

These speeds are for optimal conditions; real-world speeds are usually slower. In particular, circumstances that often lead to speeds much lower than advertised are transfer (particularly writing) of many small files rather than a few very large ones, and mixed reading and writing to the same device.\n\nIn a typical well-conducted review of a number of high-performance USB&nbsp;3.0 drives, a drive that could read large files at 68&nbsp;MB/s and write at 46&nbsp;MB/s, could only manage 14&nbsp;MB/s and 0.3&nbsp;MB/s with many small files. When combining streaming reads and writes the speed of another drive, that could read at 92&nbsp;MB/s and write at 70&nbsp;MB/s, was 8&nbsp;MB/s. These differences differ radically from one drive to another; some drives could write small files at over 10% of the speed for large ones. The examples given are chosen to illustrate extremes....\u2032<ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/usb-3.0-thumb-drive-flash-drive%2C2900.html Tom's Hardware: Nine USB 3.0 Flash Drives For Road Warriors], 26 April 2011</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Personal data transport===\nThe most common use of flash drives is to transport  and store personal files, such as documents, pictures and videos. Individuals also store medical information on flash drives for emergencies and disaster preparation.\n\n===Secure storage of data, application and software files===\nWith wide deployment(s) of flash drives being used in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of data and information security remains important. The use of [[biometrics]] and [[encryption]] is becoming the norm with the need for increased security for data; [[on-the-fly encryption]] systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a [[USB flash drive security|secure USB drive]] may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. [[IEEE 1667]] is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in [[Windows 7]] and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981319 \"An update is available that enables the support of Enhanced Storage devices in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008\"]. Microsoft Support. November 23, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Computer forensics and law enforcement===\nA recent development for the use of a USB Flash Drive as an application carrier is to carry the [[Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor]] (COFEE) application developed by [[Microsoft]]. COFEE is a set of applications designed to search for and extract [[Computer forensics|digital evidence]] on computers confiscated from suspects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004379751_msftlaw29.html |title=Microsoft device helps police pluck evidence from cyberscene of crime|newspaper=The Seattle Times|accessdate=2008-04-29 | first=Benjamin J. | last=Romano | date=2008-04-29}}</ref> Forensic software is required not to alter, in any way, the information stored on the computer being examined. Other forensic suites run from [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD-ROM]], but cannot store data on the media they are run from (although they can write to other attached devices, such as [[external drive]]s or [[Flash memory|memory sticks]]).\n\n===Updating motherboard firmware===\n[[Motherboard]] firmware (including [[BIOS]] and [[UEFI]]) can be updated using USB flash drives.  Usually, new firmware image is downloaded and placed onto a [[FAT16]]- or [[FAT32]]-formatted USB flash drive connected to a system which is to be updated, and path to the new firmware image is selected within the update component of system's firmware.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.northernmicro.com/en/support/tech-library/M4A785T-AS/WebHelp/asus_ez_flash_2_utility.htm\n |title       = ASUS EZ Flash 2 utility\n |date        = 2013-12-21\n |accessdate  = 2014-01-16\n |publisher   = northernmicro.com\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120917005940/http://www.northernmicro.com/en/support/tech-library/M4A785T-AS/WebHelp/asus_ez_flash_2_utility.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-09-17\n |df          = \n}}</ref>  Some motherboard manufacturers are also allowing such updates to be performed without the need for entering system's firmware update component, making it possible to easily recover systems with corrupted firmware.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://event.asus.com/2012/mb/usb_bios_flashback_guide/\n | title = How to Use USB BIOS Flashback\n | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-01-16\n | publisher = ASUS\n}}</ref>\n\nAlso, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] has introduced a ''USB floppy drive key'', which is an ordinary USB flash drive with additional possilibility for performing floppy drive emulation, allowing its usage for updating system firmware where direct usage of USB flash drives is not supported.  Desired mode of operation (either regular USB mass storage device or of floppy drive emulation) is made selectable by a sliding switch on the device's housing.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140114162241/https://h20565.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/psi/home/?sp4ts.oid=3374182&ac.admitted=1389715656950.876444892.492883150]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/hp-usb-floppy-drive-key-2420273/ |title=HP USB Floppy Drive Key |publisher=SlashGear |date= |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Booting operating systems===\n<!-- This image is of a drive not supported by Microsoft any longer, so it should be replaced by something supported\n[[File:Windows To Go USB Drive.png|thumb|Bootable [[Windows To Go]] USB flash drive|link=Windows To Go]] -->\nMost current PC firmware permits [[booting]] from a USB drive, allowing the launch of an operating system from a [[bootable]] flash drive. Such a configuration is known as a [[Live USB]].<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2152040/aomei-partition-assistant-review-windows-to-go-no-longer-just-for-enterprise-users.html  Boot Windows from a certified USB flash drive]. Retrieved on 14 May 2014</ref>\n\nOriginal flash memory designs had very limited estimated lifetimes. The failure mechanism for flash memory cells is analogous to a [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] mode; the device fails by refusing to write new data to specific cells that have been subject to many read-write cycles over the device's lifetime. Premature failure of a \"live USB\" could be circumvented by using a flash drive with a write-lock switch as a [[Write Once Read Many|WORM device]], identical to a [[live CD]]. Originally, this potential failure mode limited the use of \"live USB\" system to special-purpose applications or temporary tasks, such as:\n\n* Loading a minimal, hardened [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] for embedded applications (e.g., network router, firewall).\n* Bootstrapping an operating system install or [[disk cloning]] operation, often across a network.\n* Maintenance tasks, such as virus scanning or low-level data repair, without the primary host operating system loaded.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, newer flash memory designs have much higher estimated lifetimes. Several manufacturers are now offering warranties of 5 years or more. Such warranties should make the device more attractive for more applications. By reducing the probability of the device's premature failure, flash memory devices can now be considered for use where a magnetic disk would normally have been required. Flash drives have also experienced an exponential growth in their storage capacity over time (following the [[Moore's Law]] growth curve). As of 2013, single-packaged devices with capacities of 1&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] are readily available,<ref name=\"tomshardware-1tb\">{{cite web|author=Jane McEntegart |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/1TB-USB-Large-Capacity-Thumb-Drive-512GB-USB-DataTraveler-HyperX-Predator-USB-3,20278.html |title=Hands-on with Kingston's 1TB USB Stick |publisher=Tomshardware.com |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> and devices with 16&nbsp;GB capacity are very economical. Storage capacities in this range have traditionally been considered to offer adequate space, because they allow enough space for both the operating system software and some free space for the user's data.\n\n===Operating system installation media===\nInstallers of some operating systems can be stored to a flash drive instead of a CD or DVD, including various [[Linux distribution]]s, [[Windows&nbsp;7]] and newer versions, and [[macOS]]. In particular, [[Mac OS X 10.7]] is distributed only online, through the [[Mac App Store]], or on flash drives; for a [[MacBook Air]] with [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] and no external optical drive, a flash drive can be used to run installation of Windows or Linux.\n\nHowever, for installation of Windows 7 and later versions, using USB flash drive with hard disk drive emulation as detected in PC's firmware is recommended in order to boot from it. Transcend is the only manufacturer of USB flash drives containing such feature.\n\nFurthermore, for installation of [[Windows XP]], using USB flash drive with storage limit of at most 2 GB is recommended in order to boot from it.\n\n===Windows ReadyBoost===\nIn [[Windows Vista]] and later versions, [[ReadyBoost]] feature allows flash drives (from 4&nbsp;GB in case of Windows Vista) to augment operating system memory.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Brinkmann |title=Windows 7 to Extend Readyboost |url=http://windows7news.com/2008/11/01/windows-7-to-extend-readyboost/ |publisher=Windows 7 News |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2009-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106073155/http://windows7news.com/2008/11/01/windows-7-to-extend-readyboost/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Application carriers===\nFlash drives are used to carry [[List of portable software|applications]] that run on the host computer [[Portable software|without requiring installation]]. While any standalone application can in principle be used this way, many programs store data, configuration information, etc. on the hard drive and [[Windows Registry|registry]] of the host computer.\n\nThe [[U3 (software)|U3]] company works with drive makers (parent company [[SanDisk]] as well as others) to deliver custom versions of applications designed for [[Microsoft Windows]] from a special flash drive; U3-compatible devices are designed to autoload a menu when plugged into a computer running Windows. Applications must be modified for the U3 platform not to leave any data on the host machine. U3 also provides a software framework for [[independent software vendor]]s interested in their platform.\n\n[[Ceedo]] is an alternative product, with the key difference that it does not require Windows applications to be modified in order for them to be carried and run on the drive.\n\nSimilarly, other [[application virtualization]] solutions and [[portable application creators]], such as [[VMware ThinApp]] (for Windows) or RUNZ (for Linux) can be used to run software from a flash drive without installation.\n\nIn October 2010, [[Apple Inc.]] released their newest iteration of the [[MacBook Air]], which had the system's restore files contained on a USB hard drive rather than the traditional install CDs, due to the Air not coming with an optical drive.<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/20/a-compact-death/ \"Yep, Apple Killed The CD Today\"]. TechCrunch.com. October 20, 2010.</ref>\n\nA wide range of [[portable application]]s which are all free of charge, and able to run off a computer running Windows without storing anything on the host computer's drives or registry, can be found in the [[list of portable software]].\n\n===Backup===\nSome [[value-added reseller]]s are now using a flash drive as part of small-business [[turnkey]] solutions (e.g., [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] systems). The drive is used as a [[backup]] medium: at the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a [[database]] backup is saved to the drive. Alternatively, the drive can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, the drive is removed at night and taken offsite.\n\n* This is simple for the end-user, and more likely to be done.\n* The drive is small and convenient, and more likely to be carried off-site for safety.\n* The drives are less fragile mechanically and magnetically than tapes.\n* The capacity is often large enough for several backup images of critical data.\n* Flash drives are cheaper than many other backup systems.\n\nFlash drives also have disadvantages. They are easy to lose and facilitate unauthorized backups.  A lesser setback for flash drives is that they have only one tenth the capacity of hard drives manufactured around their time of distribution.\n\n===Audio players===\nMany companies make small solid-state [[digital audio player]]s, essentially producing flash drives with sound output and a simple user interface. Examples include the [[Creative MuVo]], [[Philips GoGear]] and the first generation [[iPod shuffle]]. Some of these players are true USB flash drives as well as music players; others do not support general-purpose data storage. Other applications requiring storage, such as [[Digital recording|digital voice or sound recording]], can also be combined with flash drive functionality.<ref>[http://www.olympusamerica.com/files/oima_cckb/VN-801PC_Instructions_EN.pdf From the manual for a typical digital voice recorder]: \"Apart from using this unit as a recorder, you can use it as an external memory for your computer, as an external storage device.\"</ref>\n\nMany of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery, charged from the USB interface.  Fancier devices that function as a digital audio player have a USB host port (type A female typically).\n\n===Media storage and marketing===\n[[File:Wizo USB Stick.jpg|thumb|The German band [[Wizo]]'s ''Stick EP'', released in 2004, was the first album released on a USB stick.]]\n[[Digital audio]] [[Audio file formats|files]] can be transported from one computer to another like any other file, and played on a compatible [[media player (application software)|media player]] (with caveats for [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-locked files). In addition, many home [[Hi-Fi]] and [[car audio|car stereo head units]] are now equipped with a USB port. This allows a USB flash drive containing media files in a variety of formats to be played directly on devices which support the format. Some LCD monitors for consumer HDTV viewing have a dedicated USB port through which music and video files can also be played without use of a personal computer.\n\nArtists have sold or given away USB flash drives, with the first instance believed to be in 2004 when the German punk band [[Wizo]] released the ''Stick EP'', only as a USB drive. In addition to five high-[[bitrate]] [[MP3]]s, it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and [[tablature|guitar tablature]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/vorbespielter-usb-stick-musik-zum-loeschen-a-321682.html |title= Vorbespielter USB-Stick: Musik zum L\u00f6schen |last1=Patalong |first1=Frank |date=2004-10-06 |website=[[Spiegel Online]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=2014-06-26|language=de}}</ref> Subsequently, artists including [[Year Zero (album)#Promotion|Nine Inch Nails]] and [[X (Kylie Minogue album)|Kylie Minogue]]<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-USB-Kylie-Minogue/dp/B000YVCQZW X (USB): Kylie Minogue: Amazon.co.uk: Music].

They may be given away for free, sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another purchased product.\n\nUsually, such drives will be custom-stamped with a company's [[logo]], as a form of [[advertising]]. The drive may be blank, or preloaded with graphics, documentation, web links, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] [[animation]] or other [[multimedia]], and free or demonstration software. Some preloaded drives are read-only, while others are configured with both read-only and user-writable segments. Such dual-partition drives are more expensive.<ref name=cp3>{{cite web |url=http://www.usbpromos.com/data-preloading-custom-usb-promos-usb-drives/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423060855/http://www.usbpromos.com/data-preloading-custom-usb-promos-usb-drives |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFlash drives can be set up to automatically launch stored presentations, websites, articles, and any other software immediately on insertion of the drive using the Microsoft Windows [[AutoRun]] feature.<ref name=cp1>[http://www.flashbay.com/usb_flash_drive_autorun_setup.html USB flash drive auto run setup], article from Flashbay.com</ref> Autorunning software this way does not work on all computers, and it is normally disabled by security-conscious users.\n\n===Arcades===\nIn the [[arcade game]] ''[[In the Groove (game)|In the Groove]]'' and more commonly ''[[In The Groove 2]]'', flash drives are used to transfer high scores, [[screenshots]], dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. As of software revision 21 (R21), players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be [[Linux]] compatible.\n\nIn the arcade games ''[[Pump it Up NX2]]'' and ''[[Pump it Up NXA]]'', a specially produced flash drive is used as a \"save file\" for unlocked songs, as well as for progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game.\n\nIn the arcade game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'', an exclusive USB flash drive was made by Konami for the purpose of the link feature from its Sony PlayStation 2 counterpart. However, any USB flash drive can be used in this arcade game.\n\n==Conveniences==\nFlash drives use little power, have no fragile moving parts, and for most capacities are small and light. Data stored on flash drives is impervious to mechanical shock, magnetic fields, [[Abrasion (mechanical)|scratches]] and dust. These properties make them suitable for transporting data from place to place and keeping the data readily at hand.\n\nFlash drives also store data densely compared to many removable media. In mid-2009, 256&nbsp;GB drives became available, with the ability to hold many times more data than a [[DVD]] (54 DVDs) or even a [[Blu-ray disc]] (10 BDs).<ref name=\"Kingston256GB\">Baker, Jeff (July 20, 2009) [http://www.mobilewhack.com/kingston-unveils-256gb-thumb/ \"Kingston unveils 256GB thumb\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322203554/http://www.mobilewhack.com/kingston-unveils-256gb-thumb/ |date=2012-03-22 }}, MobileWhack.com</ref>\n\nFlash drives implement the [[USB mass storage device class]] so that most modern [[operating system]]s can read and write to them without installing [[device driver]]s. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any [[file system]] or block addressing scheme. Some computers can [[Booting device|boot up]] from flash drives.\n\nSpecially manufactured flash drives are available that have a tough rubber or metal casing designed to be waterproof and virtually \"unbreakable\". These flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water, and even through a machine wash. Leaving such a flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems. [[Five (channel)|Channel Five]]'s ''[[Gadget Show]]'' cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with [[dry ice]], submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive.<ref>{{YouTube|NyOFIH-6WGs|testing removable media}} on the Gadget Show.</ref> All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.\n\n==Comparison with other portable storage==\n[[File:IBM card storage.NARA.jpg|thumb|[[Punched card]]s in storage at a U.S. Federal records center in 1959. All the data visible here could fit on a single flash drive.]]\n\n===Tape===\nThe applications of current [[data tape cartridge]]s hardly overlap those of flash drives: on tape, cost per gigabyte is very low for large volumes, but the individual drives and media are expensive. Media have a very high capacity and very fast transfer speeds, but store data [[sequential access|sequentially]] and are very slow for random access of data. While disk-based backup is now the primary medium of choice for most companies, tape backup is still popular for taking data off-site for worst-case scenarios and for very large volumes (more than a few hundreds of TB). See [[Linear Tape-Open|LTO]] tapes.\n\n===Floppy disk===\n[[File:Flash Drive v. Floppy.jpg|thumb|Size comparison of a flash drive and a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The flash drive can hold about 11,380 times more data.]]\n[[Floppy disk]] drives are rarely fitted to modern computers and are obsolete for normal purposes, although internal and external drives can be fitted if required. Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or [[booting]] from floppy disks, and so they are sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, [[BIOS]] chips. Devices with removable storage like older [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.\n\n[[Floppy disk hardware emulator]]s exist which effectively utilize the internal connections and physical attributes of a floppy disk drive to utilize a device where a USB flash drive emulates the storage space of a floppy disk in a solid state form, and can be divided into a number of individual virtual floppy [[disk image]]s using individual data channels.\n\n===Optical media===\nThe various writable and re-writable forms of [[CD]] and [[DVD]] are portable storage media supported by the vast majority of computers as of 2008. CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R can be written to only once, RW varieties up to about 1,000 erase/write cycles, while modern NAND-based flash drives often last for 500,000 or more erase/write cycles. [[DVD-RAM]] discs are the most suitable optical discs for data storage involving much rewriting.\n\n[[Optical storage device]]s are among the cheapest methods of mass data storage after the hard drive. They are slower than their flash-based counterparts. Standard 120&nbsp;mm optical discs are larger than flash drives and more subject to damage. Smaller optical media do exist, such as [[business card CD]]-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 80&nbsp;mm recordable [[MiniCD]] and [[Mini DVD]]. The small discs are more expensive than the standard size, and do not work in all drives.\n\n[[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF) version 1.50 and above has facilities to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual [[File Allocation Table|allocation tables]], spreading usage over the entire surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and [[InCD]] are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] standard). The [[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mount Rainier]] standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems on top of it and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the [[operating system]]. Many drives made today do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record a great deal of information cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives' ability to do this is their major advantage over optical media.\n\n===Flash memory cards===\n[[File:8GB media comparison.jpg|thumb|Three different [[Micro Center]]-branded digital media, showing a USB flash drive, an [[SD card]], and a Micro-SD card, all having a capacity of 8 GiB, next to a U.S 5-cent coin for size comparison]]\n[[Flash memory card]]s, e.g., [[Secure Digital card]]s, are available in various formats and capacities, and are used by many consumer devices. However, while virtually all PCs have USB ports, allowing the use of USB flash drives, memory card readers are not commonly supplied as standard equipment (particularly with desktop computers). Although inexpensive card readers are available that read many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (card plus reader) rather than one.\n\nSome manufacturers, aiming at a \"best of both worlds\" solution, have produced card readers that approach the size and form of USB flash drives (e.g., [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]] MobileLite,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.com/flash/mobilelite_reader.asp|title=MobileLite 9-in-1 Reader|publisher=[[Kingston Technology]]|accessdate=2009-04-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044548/http://kingston.com/flash/mobilelite_reader.asp|archivedate=2009-02-27|df=}}</ref> [[SanDisk]] MobileMate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item(1219)-SDDR-108-A11M-SanDisk_MobileMate_Memory_Stick_Plus_4in1_Reader.aspx |title=MobileMate Memory Stick Plus 4-in-1 Reader |publisher=[[SanDisk|Sandisk Corporation]] |accessdate=2009-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305041708/http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item%281219%29-SDDR-108-A11M-SanDisk_MobileMate_Memory_Stick_Plus_4in1_Reader.aspx |archivedate=March 5, 2009 |df= }}</ref>)  These readers are limited to a specific subset of memory card formats (such as SD, [[microSD]], or [[Memory Stick]]), and often completely enclose the card, offering durability and portability approaching, if not quite equal to, that of a flash drive. Although the combined cost of a mini-reader and a memory card is usually slightly higher than a USB flash drive of comparable capacity, the reader + card solution offers additional flexibility of use, and virtually \"unlimited\" capacity. The ubiquity of [[SD cards]] is such that, circa 2011, due to [[economies of scale]], their price is now less than an equivalent-capacity USB flash drive, even with the added cost of a USB SD card reader.\n\nAn additional advantage of memory cards is that many consumer devices (e.g., [[digital camera]]s, [[portable music player]]s) cannot make use of USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the memory cards used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.\n\n===External hard disk===\nParticularly with the advent of USB, [[External hard disk drive|external hard disks]] have become widely available and inexpensive. External hard disk drives currently cost less per gigabyte than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some hard drives support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] and [[eSATA]]). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most hard drives can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though [[Latency (engineering)#Mechanical latency|mechanical latencies]] seriously impact hard drive performance.\n\nUnlike solid-state memory, hard drives are susceptible to damage by shock (e.g., a short fall) and vibration, have limitations on use at high altitude, and although they are shielded by their casings, they are vulnerable when exposed to strong magnetic fields. In terms of overall mass, hard drives are usually larger and heavier than flash drives; however, hard disks sometimes weigh less per unit of storage. Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer from file [[fragmentation (computer)|fragmentation]], which can reduce access speed.\n\n===Obsolete devices===\n[[Compact cassette|Audio tape cassettes]] and high-capacity floppy disks (e.g., [[Imation]] [[SuperDisk]]), and other forms of drives with removable magnetic media, such as the Iomega [[Zip drive|Zip]] and [[Jaz drive]]s, are now largely obsolete and rarely used. There are products in today's market that will emulate these legacy drives for both tape and disk (SCSI1/SCSI2, SASI, Magneto optic, Ricoh ZIP, Jaz, IBM3590/ Fujitsu 3490E and Bernoulli for example) in state-of-the-art Compact Flash storage devices \u2013 CF2SCSI.\n\n===Encryption and security===\n{{main|USB flash drive security}}\n\nAs highly portable media, USB flash drives are easily lost or stolen. All USB flash drives can have their contents encrypted using third-party disk encryption software, which can often be run directly from the USB drive without installation (for example, [[FreeOTFE]]), although some, such as BitLocker, require the user to have administrative rights on every computer it is run on.\n\nArchiving software can achieve a similar result by creating encrypted [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] or [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] files.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pkware.com/software/pkzip/server/technical-specs|title=Technical Specifications - PKZIP Server - PKWARE - server - pkzip - software|author=Arlen Walker|work=pkware.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rarlab.com/rar_archiver.htm|title=WinRAR archiver, a powerful tool to process RAR and ZIP files|work=rarlab.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome manufacturers have produced USB flash drives which use hardware-based encryption as part of the design,<ref name=hardware_encryption>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldkey.com/products/secure-encrypted-flash-drive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124123810/http://www.goldkey.com/products/secure-encrypted-flash-drive.html |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}</ref> removing the need for third-party encryption software. In limited circumstances these drives have been [[USB flash drive security#Compromised systems|shown to have security problems]], and are typically more expensive than software-based systems, which are available for free.\n\nA minority of flash drives support [[biometric]] [[fingerprinting]] to confirm the user's identity. As of mid-{{As of|2005|alt=2005}},{{Update after|2010|11|13|date=November 2010}} this was an expensive alternative to standard password protection offered on many new USB flash storage devices. Most fingerprint scanning drives rely upon the host operating system to validate the fingerprint via a software driver, often restricting the drive to [[Microsoft Windows]] computers. However, there are USB drives with fingerprint scanners which use controllers that allow access to protected data without any authentication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Secure-USB-sticks-cracked--/features/110280|title=heise online - IT-News, Nachrichten und Hintergr\u00fcnde|work=heise online}}</ref>\n\nSome manufacturers deploy [[Dongle|physical authentication tokens]] in the form of a flash drive. These are used to control access to a sensitive system by containing encryption keys or, more commonly, communicating with security software on the target machine. The system is designed so the target machine will not operate except when the flash drive device is plugged into it. Some of these \"PC lock\" devices also function as normal flash drives when plugged into other machines.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Criticisms===\n{{main|Flash memory#Limitations|l1=Flash memory: Limitations}}\n\n====Failures====\nLike all flash memory devices, flash drives can sustain only a limited number of write and erase cycles before the drive fails.<ref>[http://www.bress.net/blog/archives/114-How-Long-Does-a-Flash-Drive-Last.html How Long Does a Flash Drive Last? \u2013 Josh's Blog]. 2008-05-23, Bress.net.

To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as [[Linux]] in [[Live USB]])<ref>[http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/USB-guide/x498.html Mass Storage Devices]. Linux-usb.sourceforge.net. Retrieved on 2011-05-18.</ref> or commonplace applications (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]) designed to run from flash drives. These are typically optimized for size and configured to place temporary or intermediate files in the computer's main RAM rather than store them temporarily on the flash drive.\n\nWhen used in the same manner as external rotating drives (hard drives, optical drives, or floppy drives), i.e. in ignorance of their technology, USB drives' failure is more likely to be sudden: while rotating drives ''can'' fail instantaneously, they more frequently give some indication (noises, slowness) that they are about to fail, often with enough advance warning that data can be removed before total failure. USB drives give little or no advance warning of failure. Furthermore, when internal wear-leveling is applied to prolong life of the flash drive, once failure of even part of the memory occurs it can be difficult or impossible to use the remainder of the drive, which differs from magnetic media, where bad sectors can be marked permanently not to be used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Notenboom |first=Leo A. |url=http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_fix_bad_sectors_on_a_flash_drive.html |title=How do I fix bad sectors on a flash drive? |website=Ask-leo.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\nMost USB flash drives do not include a [[write protection]] mechanism. This feature, which gradually became less common, consists of a switch on the housing of the drive itself, that prevents the host computer from writing or modifying data on the drive.  For example, write protection makes a device suitable for repairing [[computer virus|virus]]-contaminated host computers without the risk of infecting a USB flash drive itself.  In contrast to [[SD card]]s, write protection on USB flash drives (when available) is connected to the drive circuitry, and is handled by the drive itself instead of the host (on SD cards handling of the write-protection notch is optional).\n\nA drawback to the small physical size of flash drives is that they are easily misplaced or otherwise lost. This is a particular problem if they contain sensitive data (see [[data security]]). As a consequence, some manufacturers have added encryption hardware to their drives, although [[Comparison of disk encryption software|software encryption systems]] which can be used in conjunction with any [[mass storage]] medium will achieve the same result. Most drives can be attached to keychains or lanyards. The USB plug is usually retractable or fitted with a removable protective cap.\n\n====Storage capacity====\nStorage capacity of USB flash drives in 2019 was up to 2 TB while hard disks can be as large as 16 TB. As of 2011, USB flash drives were more expensive per unit of storage than large hard drives, but were less expensive in capacities of a few tens of gigabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storagesearch.com/semico-art1.html |title=Flash Memory vs. HDD - which will win? - SSD article on |website=Storagesearch.com |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Robustness====\nMost USB-based flash technology integrates a printed circuit board with a metal tip, which is simply soldered on. As a result, the stress point is where the two pieces join. The quality control of some manufacturers does not ensure a proper solder temperature, further weakening the stress point.<ref>[[Soldering#Electronics|Wikipedia entry \"Soldering Defects in Electronics]]</ref><ref>[[Cold solder joint|Wikipedia entry \"Processes \u2013 Electronic Components (PCBs)\"]]</ref> Since many flash drives stick out from computers, they are likely to be bumped repeatedly and may break at the stress point. Most of the time, a break at the stress point tears the joint from the printed circuit board and results in permanent damage. However, some manufacturers produce discreet flash drives that do not stick out, and others use a solid metal or plastic uni-body that has no easily discernible stress point.  SD cards serve as a good alternative to USB drives since they can be inserted flush.\n\n===Security threats===\n====BadUSB====\n{{Main|BadUSB}}\n\nFlash drives may present a significant security challenge for some organizations. Their small size and ease of use allows unsupervised visitors or employees to store and smuggle out confidential data with little chance of detection. Both corporate and public computers are vulnerable to attackers connecting a flash drive to a free USB port and using malicious software such as [[keyboard logger]]s or [[packet sniffer]]s.\n\nFor computers set up to be bootable from a USB drive, it is possible to use a flash drive containing a bootable portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if the computer is password protected. The password can then be changed, or it may be possible to crack the password with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer. Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.\n\nUSB flash drives may also be used deliberately or unwittingly to transfer [[malware]] and autorun [[computer worm|worms]] onto a network.\n\nSome organizations forbid the use of flash drives, and some computers are configured to disable the mounting of USB mass storage devices by users other than administrators; others use third-party software to control USB usage. The use of software allows the administrator to not only provide a USB lock but also control the use of CD-RW, SD cards and other memory devices. This enables companies with policies forbidding the use of USB flash drives in the workplace to enforce these policies. In a lower-tech security solution, some organizations disconnect USB ports inside the computer or fill the USB sockets with [[epoxy]].\n\nSome of the security measures taken to prevent confidential data from being taken have presented some side effects such as curtailing user privileges of recharging mobile devices off the USB ports on the systems.\n\n====USB killer====\n{{main|USB Killer}}\nIn appearance similar to a USB flash drive, a USB killer is a circuit that charges up [[capacitor]]s to a high voltage using the power supply pins of a [[USB#Connectors|USB port]] then discharges high voltage pulses onto the data pins. This completely standalone device can instantly and permanently damage or destroy any host hardware that it is connected to.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2896732/dont-trust-other-peoples-usb-flash-drives-they-could-fry-your-laptop.html\n |title=USB Killer is a flash drive designed to fry your laptop\n |last=Constantin\n |first=Lucian\n |date=Mar 13, 2015\n |website=[[PC World]]\n |access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===\"Flash Drives for Freedom\"===\nThe New York-based [[Human Rights Foundation]] collaborated with [[Forum 280]] and [[USB Memory Direct]] to launch the \"Flash Drives for Freedom\" program.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taggart |first1=Emma |title=You Can Donate Old USB Drives to These Activists to Help Free North Koreans of Propaganda |url=https://mymodernmet.com/north-korea-flash-drives-for-freedom/ |work=My Modern Met |accessdate=10 January 2019 |language=en |date=22 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Desreumaux |first1=Geoff |title=Flash Drives For Freedom: Your Old USB Drives Can Help Overthrow Dictatorships |url=https://wersm.com/flash-drives-for-freedom-your-old-usb-drives-can-help-overthrow-dictatorship/ |accessdate=10 January 2019 |work=WeRSM - We are Social Media |date=23 August 2018}}</ref> The program was created in 2016 to smuggle flash drives with [[United States|American]] and [[South Korea]]n movies and television shows, as well as a copy of the [[Korean language|Korean]] [[Wikipedia]], into [[North Korea]] to spread pro-Western sentiment.<ref name=\"theguardianflashdrivesforfreedom\">{{cite news|last1=Hands|first1=Jack|title=Flashdrives for freedom? 20,000 USBs to be smuggled into North Korea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/flashdrives-for-freedom-north-korea-20000-usb-sticks|accessdate=March 18, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=March 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"reasonhowactivistsareusing\">{{cite web|last1=Bragg|first1=Austin|last2=Bragg|first2=Meredith|last3=Detrick|first3=Paul|title=#SXSW: How Activists Are Using Technology to Fight Dictators|url=https://reason.com/reasontv/2017/03/15/sxsw-how-activists-are-using-technology|website=Reason Foundation|accessdate=March 18, 2017|date=March 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Naming==\nIn 2005, Microsoft was using the term \"USB Flash Drive\" as the common name for these devices when they introduced the ''Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20034 |title=Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager application |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Alternative names <!-- please do not add alternative names, see talk archives for long history -->are commonly used, many of which are trademarks of various manufacturers.\n\n==Current and future developments==\n[[File:USB 3.0 Flash Drive PCB.jpg|thumb|The internals of a 32&nbsp;GB [[Toshiba]] USB 3.0 flash drive.

Compared with [[floppy disk]]s or [[Compact disc|CDs]], they are smaller, faster, have significantly more capacity, and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts.  Additionally, they are immune to [[electromagnetic interference]] (unlike floppy disks), and are unharmed by surface scratches (unlike CDs). Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the \"1.44 megabyte\" (1440 [[kibibyte]]) 3.5-inch floppy disk.\n\nUSB flash drives use the [[USB mass storage device class]] standard, supported natively by modern [[operating system]]s such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], {{nowrap|[[macOS]]}} and other [[Unix-like]] systems, as well as many [[BIOS]] boot ROMs. USB drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives and can be read by many other systems such as the [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]], DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, though the electronically similar [[SD card]] is better suited for those devices.\n\nA flash drive consists of a small [[printed circuit board]] carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberized case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting into the body of the drive, although it is not likely to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a [[portable media player]] with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.<!-- There are more devices than just this, TomTom ONE for example.

The memory storage was based on earlier [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] technologies. These had limited capacity, were slow for both reading and writing, required complex high-voltage drive circuitry, and could be re-written only after erasing the entire contents of the chip.\n\nHardware designers later developed EEPROMs with the erasure region broken up into smaller \"fields\" that could be erased individually without affecting the others. Altering the contents of a particular memory location involved copying the entire field into an off-chip buffer memory, erasing the field, modifying the data as required in the buffer, and re-writing it into the same field. This required considerable computer support, and PC-based EEPROM flash memory systems often carried their own dedicated microprocessor system. Flash drives are more or less a miniaturized version of this.\n\nThe development of high-speed serial data interfaces such as [[USB]] made semiconductor memory systems with serially accessed storage viable, and the simultaneous development of small, high-speed, low-power microprocessor systems allowed this to be incorporated into extremely compact systems. Serial access requires far fewer electrical connections for the memory chips than does [[Random-access memory|parallel access]], which has simplified the manufacture of multi-[[gigabyte]] drives.\n\nComputers access {{as of|2009|alt=modern}} flash memory systems very much like hard disk drives, where the [[Flash memory controller|controller system]] has full control over where information is actually stored. The actual EEPROM writing and erasure processes are, however, still very similar to the earlier systems described above.\n\nMany low-cost [[MP3 player]]s simply add extra software and a battery to a standard flash memory control microprocessor so it can also serve as a music playback decoder. Most of these players can also be used as a conventional flash drive, for storing files of any type.\n\n===Essential components===\n[[File:Kingston DataTraveler flash drive disassembled.jpg|thumb|The internal mechanical and electronic parts of a Kingston 2&nbsp;GB flash drive]]\nThere are typically five parts to a flash drive:\n\n* Standard-A USB plug{{snd}} provides a physical interface to the host computer. Some USB flash drives use USB plug that does not protect the 4 contacts, with the possibility of plugging it into the USB port the other way around.\n* USB mass storage controller{{snd}} a small [[microcontroller]] with a small amount of on-chip [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and [[Random Access Memory|RAM]].\n* [[NAND flash]] memory chip(s){{snd}} stores data (NAND flash is typically also used in [[digital camera]]s).\n* [[Crystal oscillator]]{{snd}} produces the device's main 12&nbsp;MHz [[clock signal]] and controls the device's data output through a [[phase-locked loop]].\n* Cover{{snd}} typically made of plastic or metal, protecting the electronics against mechanical stress and even possible short circuits.\n\n===Additional components===\nThe typical device may also include:\n\n[[File:USB flash drive2.jpg|thumb|right|The front and rear side of a USB flash drive with the casing removed]]\n\n* [[Jumper (computing)|Jumpers]] and test pins \u2013 for testing during the flash drive's manufacturing or loading code into its [[microcontroller]].\n* [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] \u2013 indicate data transfers or data reads and writes.\n* [[write protection|Write-protect]] switches \u2013 Enable or disable writing of data into memory.\n* Unpopulated space \u2013 provides space to include a second memory chip. Having this second space allows the manufacturer to use a single printed circuit board for more than one storage size device.\n* USB connector cover or cap \u2013 reduces the risk of damage, prevents the entry of dirt or other contaminants, and improves overall device appearance. Some flash drives use retractable USB connectors instead. Others have a swivel arrangement so that the connector can be protected without removing anything.\n* Transport aid \u2013 the cap or the body often contains a hole suitable for connection to a [[key chain]] or [[lanyard]]. Connecting the cap, rather than the body, can allow the drive itself to be lost.\n* Some drives offer expandable storage via an internal [[memory card]] slot, much like a memory [[card reader]].<ref>[http://www.ces-show.com/2006/review/pny/pny_usb_flash_drive.html PNY USB Flash Drive \u2013 CES 2006 \u2013 LetsGoDigital].

These are typically low capacity USB drives whose flash memory controller [[firmware]] is modified so that they emulate larger capacity drives (for example, a 2&nbsp;GB drive being marketed as a 64&nbsp;GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report themselves as being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data. Software tools exist to check and detect fake USB drives,<ref>[http://www.heise.de/software/download/h2testw/50539 \"H2testw USB flash drive test tool\"], www.heise.de, retrieved November 16, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usbdev.ru/articles/detect_controller/ |language=ru |title=\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0444\u043b\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0438 |trans-title=Detecting controller model and memory type of flash drive |publisher=usbdev.ru |accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> and in some cases it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit.<ref>[http://fixfakeflash.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/about-vid-pid-repairing-counterfeit-flash-drives-steps-to-succeed/ \"About VID PID Repairing Counterfeit Flash Drives \u2013 Steps To Succeed\"], fixfakeflash.wordpress.com, retrieved November 16, 2010</ref>\n\n==File transfer speeds==\nTransfer speeds are technically determined by the slowest of three factors: the USB version used, the speed in which the USB controller device can read and write data onto the flash memory, and the speed of the [[Bus (computing)|hardware bus]], especially in the case of add-on USB ports.\n\nUSB flash drives usually specify their read and write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s); read speed is usually faster. These speeds are for optimal conditions; real-world speeds are usually slower. In particular, circumstances that often lead to speeds much lower than advertised are transfer (particularly writing) of many small files rather than a few very large ones, and mixed reading and writing to the same device.\n\nIn a typical well-conducted review of a number of high-performance USB&nbsp;3.0 drives, a drive that could read large files at 68&nbsp;MB/s and write at 46&nbsp;MB/s, could only manage 14&nbsp;MB/s and 0.3&nbsp;MB/s with many small files. When combining streaming reads and writes the speed of another drive, that could read at 92&nbsp;MB/s and write at 70&nbsp;MB/s, was 8&nbsp;MB/s. These differences differ radically from one drive to another; some drives could write small files at over 10% of the speed for large ones. The examples given are chosen to illustrate extremes....\u2032<ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/usb-3.0-thumb-drive-flash-drive%2C2900.html Tom's Hardware: Nine USB 3.0 Flash Drives For Road Warriors], 26 April 2011</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Personal data transport===\nThe most common use of flash drives is to transport  and store personal files, such as documents, pictures and videos. Individuals also store medical information on flash drives for emergencies and disaster preparation.\n\n===Secure storage of data, application and software files===\nWith wide deployment(s) of flash drives being used in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of data and information security remains important. The use of [[biometrics]] and [[encryption]] is becoming the norm with the need for increased security for data; [[on-the-fly encryption]] systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a [[USB flash drive security|secure USB drive]] may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. [[IEEE 1667]] is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in [[Windows 7]] and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981319 \"An update is available that enables the support of Enhanced Storage devices in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008\"]. Microsoft Support. November 23, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Computer forensics and law enforcement===\nA recent development for the use of a USB Flash Drive as an application carrier is to carry the [[Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor]] (COFEE) application developed by [[Microsoft]]. COFEE is a set of applications designed to search for and extract [[Computer forensics|digital evidence]] on computers confiscated from suspects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004379751_msftlaw29.html |title=Microsoft device helps police pluck evidence from cyberscene of crime|newspaper=The Seattle Times|accessdate=2008-04-29 | first=Benjamin J. | last=Romano | date=2008-04-29}}</ref> Forensic software is required not to alter, in any way, the information stored on the computer being examined. Other forensic suites run from [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD-ROM]], but cannot store data on the media they are run from (although they can write to other attached devices, such as [[external drive]]s or [[Flash memory|memory sticks]]).\n\n===Updating motherboard firmware===\n[[Motherboard]] firmware (including [[BIOS]] and [[UEFI]]) can be updated using USB flash drives.  Usually, new firmware image is downloaded and placed onto a [[FAT16]]- or [[FAT32]]-formatted USB flash drive connected to a system which is to be updated, and path to the new firmware image is selected within the update component of system's firmware.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.northernmicro.com/en/support/tech-library/M4A785T-AS/WebHelp/asus_ez_flash_2_utility.htm\n |title       = ASUS EZ Flash 2 utility\n |date        = 2013-12-21\n |accessdate  = 2014-01-16\n |publisher   = northernmicro.com\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120917005940/http://www.northernmicro.com/en/support/tech-library/M4A785T-AS/WebHelp/asus_ez_flash_2_utility.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-09-17\n |df          = \n}}</ref>  Some motherboard manufacturers are also allowing such updates to be performed without the need for entering system's firmware update component, making it possible to easily recover systems with corrupted firmware.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://event.asus.com/2012/mb/usb_bios_flashback_guide/\n | title = How to Use USB BIOS Flashback\n | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-01-16\n | publisher = ASUS\n}}</ref>\n\nAlso, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] has introduced a ''USB floppy drive key'', which is an ordinary USB flash drive with additional possilibility for performing floppy drive emulation, allowing its usage for updating system firmware where direct usage of USB flash drives is not supported.  Desired mode of operation (either regular USB mass storage device or of floppy drive emulation) is made selectable by a sliding switch on the device's housing.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140114162241/https://h20565.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/psi/home/?sp4ts.oid=3374182&ac.admitted=1389715656950.876444892.492883150]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/hp-usb-floppy-drive-key-2420273/ |title=HP USB Floppy Drive Key |publisher=SlashGear |date= |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Booting operating systems===\n<!-- This image is of a drive not supported by Microsoft any longer, so it should be replaced by something supported\n[[File:Windows To Go USB Drive.png|thumb|Bootable [[Windows To Go]] USB flash drive|link=Windows To Go]] -->\nMost current PC firmware permits [[booting]] from a USB drive, allowing the launch of an operating system from a [[bootable]] flash drive. Such a configuration is known as a [[Live USB]].<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2152040/aomei-partition-assistant-review-windows-to-go-no-longer-just-for-enterprise-users.html  Boot Windows from a certified USB flash drive]. Retrieved on 14 May 2014</ref>\n\nOriginal flash memory designs had very limited estimated lifetimes. The failure mechanism for flash memory cells is analogous to a [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] mode; the device fails by refusing to write new data to specific cells that have been subject to many read-write cycles over the device's lifetime. Premature failure of a \"live USB\" could be circumvented by using a flash drive with a write-lock switch as a [[Write Once Read Many|WORM device]], identical to a [[live CD]]. Originally, this potential failure mode limited the use of \"live USB\" system to special-purpose applications or temporary tasks, such as:\n\n* Loading a minimal, hardened [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] for embedded applications (e.g., network router, firewall).\n* Bootstrapping an operating system install or [[disk cloning]] operation, often across a network.\n* Maintenance tasks, such as virus scanning or low-level data repair, without the primary host operating system loaded.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, newer flash memory designs have much higher estimated lifetimes. Several manufacturers are now offering warranties of 5 years or more. Such warranties should make the device more attractive for more applications. By reducing the probability of the device's premature failure, flash memory devices can now be considered for use where a magnetic disk would normally have been required. Flash drives have also experienced an exponential growth in their storage capacity over time (following the [[Moore's Law]] growth curve). As of 2013, single-packaged devices with capacities of 1&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] are readily available,<ref name=\"tomshardware-1tb\">{{cite web|author=Jane McEntegart |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/1TB-USB-Large-Capacity-Thumb-Drive-512GB-USB-DataTraveler-HyperX-Predator-USB-3,20278.html |title=Hands-on with Kingston's 1TB USB Stick |publisher=Tomshardware.com |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> and devices with 16&nbsp;GB capacity are very economical. Storage capacities in this range have traditionally been considered to offer adequate space, because they allow enough space for both the operating system software and some free space for the user's data.\n\n===Operating system installation media===\nInstallers of some operating systems can be stored to a flash drive instead of a CD or DVD, including various [[Linux distribution]]s, [[Windows&nbsp;7]] and newer versions, and [[macOS]]. In particular, [[Mac OS X 10.7]] is distributed only online, through the [[Mac App Store]], or on flash drives; for a [[MacBook Air]] with [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] and no external optical drive, a flash drive can be used to run installation of Windows or Linux.\n\nHowever, for installation of Windows 7 and later versions, using USB flash drive with hard disk drive emulation as detected in PC's firmware is recommended in order to boot from it. Transcend is the only manufacturer of USB flash drives containing such feature.\n\nFurthermore, for installation of [[Windows XP]], using USB flash drive with storage limit of at most 2 GB is recommended in order to boot from it.\n\n===Windows ReadyBoost===\nIn [[Windows Vista]] and later versions, [[ReadyBoost]] feature allows flash drives (from 4&nbsp;GB in case of Windows Vista) to augment operating system memory.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Brinkmann |title=Windows 7 to Extend Readyboost |url=http://windows7news.com/2008/11/01/windows-7-to-extend-readyboost/ |publisher=Windows 7 News |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2009-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106073155/http://windows7news.com/2008/11/01/windows-7-to-extend-readyboost/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Application carriers===\nFlash drives are used to carry [[List of portable software|applications]] that run on the host computer [[Portable software|without requiring installation]]. While any standalone application can in principle be used this way, many programs store data, configuration information, etc. on the hard drive and [[Windows Registry|registry]] of the host computer.\n\nThe [[U3 (software)|U3]] company works with drive makers (parent company [[SanDisk]] as well as others) to deliver custom versions of applications designed for [[Microsoft Windows]] from a special flash drive; U3-compatible devices are designed to autoload a menu when plugged into a computer running Windows. Applications must be modified for the U3 platform not to leave any data on the host machine. U3 also provides a software framework for [[independent software vendor]]s interested in their platform.\n\n[[Ceedo]] is an alternative product, with the key difference that it does not require Windows applications to be modified in order for them to be carried and run on the drive.\n\nSimilarly, other [[application virtualization]] solutions and [[portable application creators]], such as [[VMware ThinApp]] (for Windows) or RUNZ (for Linux) can be used to run software from a flash drive without installation.\n\nIn October 2010, [[Apple Inc.]] released their newest iteration of the [[MacBook Air]], which had the system's restore files contained on a USB hard drive rather than the traditional install CDs, due to the Air not coming with an optical drive.<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/20/a-compact-death/ \"Yep, Apple Killed The CD Today\"]. TechCrunch.com. October 20, 2010.</ref>\n\nA wide range of [[portable application]]s which are all free of charge, and able to run off a computer running Windows without storing anything on the host computer's drives or registry, can be found in the [[list of portable software]].\n\n===Backup===\nSome [[value-added reseller]]s are now using a flash drive as part of small-business [[turnkey]] solutions (e.g., [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] systems). The drive is used as a [[backup]] medium: at the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a [[database]] backup is saved to the drive. Alternatively, the drive can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, the drive is removed at night and taken offsite.\n\n* This is simple for the end-user, and more likely to be done.\n* The drive is small and convenient, and more likely to be carried off-site for safety.\n* The drives are less fragile mechanically and magnetically than tapes.\n* The capacity is often large enough for several backup images of critical data.\n* Flash drives are cheaper than many other backup systems.\n\nFlash drives also have disadvantages. They are easy to lose and facilitate unauthorized backups.  A lesser setback for flash drives is that they have only one tenth the capacity of hard drives manufactured around their time of distribution.\n\n===Audio players===\nMany companies make small solid-state [[digital audio player]]s, essentially producing flash drives with sound output and a simple user interface. Examples include the [[Creative MuVo]], [[Philips GoGear]] and the first generation [[iPod shuffle]]. Some of these players are true USB flash drives as well as music players; others do not support general-purpose data storage. Other applications requiring storage, such as [[Digital recording|digital voice or sound recording]], can also be combined with flash drive functionality.<ref>[http://www.olympusamerica.com/files/oima_cckb/VN-801PC_Instructions_EN.pdf From the manual for a typical digital voice recorder]: \"Apart from using this unit as a recorder, you can use it as an external memory for your computer, as an external storage device.\"</ref>\n\nMany of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery, charged from the USB interface.  Fancier devices that function as a digital audio player have a USB host port (type A female typically).\n\n===Media storage and marketing===\n[[File:Wizo USB Stick.jpg|thumb|The German band [[Wizo]]'s ''Stick EP'', released in 2004, was the first album released on a USB stick.]]\n[[Digital audio]] [[Audio file formats|files]] can be transported from one computer to another like any other file, and played on a compatible [[media player (application software)|media player]] (with caveats for [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-locked files). In addition, many home [[Hi-Fi]] and [[car audio|car stereo head units]] are now equipped with a USB port. This allows a USB flash drive containing media files in a variety of formats to be played directly on devices which support the format. Some LCD monitors for consumer HDTV viewing have a dedicated USB port through which music and video files can also be played without use of a personal computer.\n\nArtists have sold or given away USB flash drives, with the first instance believed to be in 2004 when the German punk band [[Wizo]] released the ''Stick EP'', only as a USB drive. In addition to five high-[[bitrate]] [[MP3]]s, it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and [[tablature|guitar tablature]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/vorbespielter-usb-stick-musik-zum-loeschen-a-321682.html |title= Vorbespielter USB-Stick: Musik zum L\u00f6schen |last1=Patalong |first1=Frank |date=2004-10-06 |website=[[Spiegel Online]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=2014-06-26|language=de}}</ref> Subsequently, artists including [[Year Zero (album)#Promotion|Nine Inch Nails]] and [[X (Kylie Minogue album)|Kylie Minogue]]<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-USB-Kylie-Minogue/dp/B000YVCQZW X (USB): Kylie Minogue: Amazon.co.uk: Music].

They may be given away for free, sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another purchased product.\n\nUsually, such drives will be custom-stamped with a company's [[logo]], as a form of [[advertising]]. The drive may be blank, or preloaded with graphics, documentation, web links, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] [[animation]] or other [[multimedia]], and free or demonstration software. Some preloaded drives are read-only, while others are configured with both read-only and user-writable segments. Such dual-partition drives are more expensive.<ref name=cp3>{{cite web |url=http://www.usbpromos.com/data-preloading-custom-usb-promos-usb-drives/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423060855/http://www.usbpromos.com/data-preloading-custom-usb-promos-usb-drives |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFlash drives can be set up to automatically launch stored presentations, websites, articles, and any other software immediately on insertion of the drive using the Microsoft Windows [[AutoRun]] feature.<ref name=cp1>[http://www.flashbay.com/usb_flash_drive_autorun_setup.html USB flash drive auto run setup], article from Flashbay.com</ref> Autorunning software this way does not work on all computers, and it is normally disabled by security-conscious users.\n\n===Arcades===\nIn the [[arcade game]] ''[[In the Groove (game)|In the Groove]]'' and more commonly ''[[In The Groove 2]]'', flash drives are used to transfer high scores, [[screenshots]], dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. As of software revision 21 (R21), players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be [[Linux]] compatible.\n\nIn the arcade games ''[[Pump it Up NX2]]'' and ''[[Pump it Up NXA]]'', a specially produced flash drive is used as a \"save file\" for unlocked songs, as well as for progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game.\n\nIn the arcade game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'', an exclusive USB flash drive was made by Konami for the purpose of the link feature from its Sony PlayStation 2 counterpart. However, any USB flash drive can be used in this arcade game.\n\n==Conveniences==\nFlash drives use little power, have no fragile moving parts, and for most capacities are small and light. Data stored on flash drives is impervious to mechanical shock, magnetic fields, [[Abrasion (mechanical)|scratches]] and dust. These properties make them suitable for transporting data from place to place and keeping the data readily at hand.\n\nFlash drives also store data densely compared to many removable media. In mid-2009, 256&nbsp;GB drives became available, with the ability to hold many times more data than a [[DVD]] (54 DVDs) or even a [[Blu-ray disc]] (10 BDs).<ref name=\"Kingston256GB\">Baker, Jeff (July 20, 2009) [http://www.mobilewhack.com/kingston-unveils-256gb-thumb/ \"Kingston unveils 256GB thumb\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322203554/http://www.mobilewhack.com/kingston-unveils-256gb-thumb/ |date=2012-03-22 }}, MobileWhack.com</ref>\n\nFlash drives implement the [[USB mass storage device class]] so that most modern [[operating system]]s can read and write to them without installing [[device driver]]s. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any [[file system]] or block addressing scheme. Some computers can [[Booting device|boot up]] from flash drives.\n\nSpecially manufactured flash drives are available that have a tough rubber or metal casing designed to be waterproof and virtually \"unbreakable\". These flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water, and even through a machine wash. Leaving such a flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems. [[Five (channel)|Channel Five]]'s ''[[Gadget Show]]'' cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with [[dry ice]], submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive.<ref>{{YouTube|NyOFIH-6WGs|testing removable media}} on the Gadget Show.</ref> All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.\n\n==Comparison with other portable storage==\n[[File:IBM card storage.NARA.jpg|thumb|[[Punched card]]s in storage at a U.S. Federal records center in 1959. All the data visible here could fit on a single flash drive.]]\n\n===Tape===\nThe applications of current [[data tape cartridge]]s hardly overlap those of flash drives: on tape, cost per gigabyte is very low for large volumes, but the individual drives and media are expensive. Media have a very high capacity and very fast transfer speeds, but store data [[sequential access|sequentially]] and are very slow for random access of data. While disk-based backup is now the primary medium of choice for most companies, tape backup is still popular for taking data off-site for worst-case scenarios and for very large volumes (more than a few hundreds of TB). See [[Linear Tape-Open|LTO]] tapes.\n\n===Floppy disk===\n[[File:Flash Drive v. Floppy.jpg|thumb|Size comparison of a flash drive and a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The flash drive can hold about 11,380 times more data.]]\n[[Floppy disk]] drives are rarely fitted to modern computers and are obsolete for normal purposes, although internal and external drives can be fitted if required. Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or [[booting]] from floppy disks, and so they are sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, [[BIOS]] chips. Devices with removable storage like older [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.\n\n[[Floppy disk hardware emulator]]s exist which effectively utilize the internal connections and physical attributes of a floppy disk drive to utilize a device where a USB flash drive emulates the storage space of a floppy disk in a solid state form, and can be divided into a number of individual virtual floppy [[disk image]]s using individual data channels.\n\n===Optical media===\nThe various writable and re-writable forms of [[CD]] and [[DVD]] are portable storage media supported by the vast majority of computers as of 2008. CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R can be written to only once, RW varieties up to about 1,000 erase/write cycles, while modern NAND-based flash drives often last for 500,000 or more erase/write cycles. [[DVD-RAM]] discs are the most suitable optical discs for data storage involving much rewriting.\n\n[[Optical storage device]]s are among the cheapest methods of mass data storage after the hard drive. They are slower than their flash-based counterparts. Standard 120&nbsp;mm optical discs are larger than flash drives and more subject to damage. Smaller optical media do exist, such as [[business card CD]]-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 80&nbsp;mm recordable [[MiniCD]] and [[Mini DVD]]. The small discs are more expensive than the standard size, and do not work in all drives.\n\n[[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF) version 1.50 and above has facilities to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual [[File Allocation Table|allocation tables]], spreading usage over the entire surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and [[InCD]] are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] standard). The [[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mount Rainier]] standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems on top of it and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the [[operating system]]. Many drives made today do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record a great deal of information cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives' ability to do this is their major advantage over optical media.\n\n===Flash memory cards===\n[[File:8GB media comparison.jpg|thumb|Three different [[Micro Center]]-branded digital media, showing a USB flash drive, an [[SD card]], and a Micro-SD card, all having a capacity of 8 GiB, next to a U.S 5-cent coin for size comparison]]\n[[Flash memory card]]s, e.g., [[Secure Digital card]]s, are available in various formats and capacities, and are used by many consumer devices. However, while virtually all PCs have USB ports, allowing the use of USB flash drives, memory card readers are not commonly supplied as standard equipment (particularly with desktop computers). Although inexpensive card readers are available that read many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (card plus reader) rather than one.\n\nSome manufacturers, aiming at a \"best of both worlds\" solution, have produced card readers that approach the size and form of USB flash drives (e.g., [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]] MobileLite,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.com/flash/mobilelite_reader.asp|title=MobileLite 9-in-1 Reader|publisher=[[Kingston Technology]]|accessdate=2009-04-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044548/http://kingston.com/flash/mobilelite_reader.asp|archivedate=2009-02-27|df=}}</ref> [[SanDisk]] MobileMate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item(1219)-SDDR-108-A11M-SanDisk_MobileMate_Memory_Stick_Plus_4in1_Reader.aspx |title=MobileMate Memory Stick Plus 4-in-1 Reader |publisher=[[SanDisk|Sandisk Corporation]] |accessdate=2009-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305041708/http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item%281219%29-SDDR-108-A11M-SanDisk_MobileMate_Memory_Stick_Plus_4in1_Reader.aspx |archivedate=March 5, 2009 |df= }}</ref>)  These readers are limited to a specific subset of memory card formats (such as SD, [[microSD]], or [[Memory Stick]]), and often completely enclose the card, offering durability and portability approaching, if not quite equal to, that of a flash drive. Although the combined cost of a mini-reader and a memory card is usually slightly higher than a USB flash drive of comparable capacity, the reader + card solution offers additional flexibility of use, and virtually \"unlimited\" capacity. The ubiquity of [[SD cards]] is such that, circa 2011, due to [[economies of scale]], their price is now less than an equivalent-capacity USB flash drive, even with the added cost of a USB SD card reader.\n\nAn additional advantage of memory cards is that many consumer devices (e.g., [[digital camera]]s, [[portable music player]]s) cannot make use of USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the memory cards used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.\n\n===External hard disk===\nParticularly with the advent of USB, [[External hard disk drive|external hard disks]] have become widely available and inexpensive. External hard disk drives currently cost less per gigabyte than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some hard drives support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] and [[eSATA]]). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most hard drives can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though [[Latency (engineering)#Mechanical latency|mechanical latencies]] seriously impact hard drive performance.\n\nUnlike solid-state memory, hard drives are susceptible to damage by shock (e.g., a short fall) and vibration, have limitations on use at high altitude, and although they are shielded by their casings, they are vulnerable when exposed to strong magnetic fields. In terms of overall mass, hard drives are usually larger and heavier than flash drives; however, hard disks sometimes weigh less per unit of storage. Like flash drives, hard disks also suffer from file [[fragmentation (computer)|fragmentation]], which can reduce access speed.\n\n===Obsolete devices===\n[[Compact cassette|Audio tape cassettes]] and high-capacity floppy disks (e.g., [[Imation]] [[SuperDisk]]), and other forms of drives with removable magnetic media, such as the Iomega [[Zip drive|Zip]] and [[Jaz drive]]s, are now largely obsolete and rarely used. There are products in today's market that will emulate these legacy drives for both tape and disk (SCSI1/SCSI2, SASI, Magneto optic, Ricoh ZIP, Jaz, IBM3590/ Fujitsu 3490E and Bernoulli for example) in state-of-the-art Compact Flash storage devices \u2013 CF2SCSI.\n\n===Encryption and security===\n{{main|USB flash drive security}}\n\nAs highly portable media, USB flash drives are easily lost or stolen. All USB flash drives can have their contents encrypted using third-party disk encryption software, which can often be run directly from the USB drive without installation (for example, [[FreeOTFE]]), although some, such as BitLocker, require the user to have administrative rights on every computer it is run on.\n\nArchiving software can achieve a similar result by creating encrypted [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] or [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] files.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pkware.com/software/pkzip/server/technical-specs|title=Technical Specifications - PKZIP Server - PKWARE - server - pkzip - software|author=Arlen Walker|work=pkware.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rarlab.com/rar_archiver.htm|title=WinRAR archiver, a powerful tool to process RAR and ZIP files|work=rarlab.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome manufacturers have produced USB flash drives which use hardware-based encryption as part of the design,<ref name=hardware_encryption>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldkey.com/products/secure-encrypted-flash-drive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124123810/http://www.goldkey.com/products/secure-encrypted-flash-drive.html |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}</ref> removing the need for third-party encryption software. In limited circumstances these drives have been [[USB flash drive security#Compromised systems|shown to have security problems]], and are typically more expensive than software-based systems, which are available for free.\n\nA minority of flash drives support [[biometric]] [[fingerprinting]] to confirm the user's identity. As of mid-{{As of|2005|alt=2005}},{{Update after|2010|11|13|date=November 2010}} this was an expensive alternative to standard password protection offered on many new USB flash storage devices. Most fingerprint scanning drives rely upon the host operating system to validate the fingerprint via a software driver, often restricting the drive to [[Microsoft Windows]] computers. However, there are USB drives with fingerprint scanners which use controllers that allow access to protected data without any authentication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Secure-USB-sticks-cracked--/features/110280|title=heise online - IT-News, Nachrichten und Hintergr\u00fcnde|work=heise online}}</ref>\n\nSome manufacturers deploy [[Dongle|physical authentication tokens]] in the form of a flash drive. These are used to control access to a sensitive system by containing encryption keys or, more commonly, communicating with security software on the target machine. The system is designed so the target machine will not operate except when the flash drive device is plugged into it. Some of these \"PC lock\" devices also function as normal flash drives when plugged into other machines.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Criticisms===\n{{main|Flash memory#Limitations|l1=Flash memory: Limitations}}\n\n====Failures====\nLike all flash memory devices, flash drives can sustain only a limited number of write and erase cycles before the drive fails.<ref>[http://www.bress.net/blog/archives/114-How-Long-Does-a-Flash-Drive-Last.html How Long Does a Flash Drive Last? \u2013 Josh's Blog]. 2008-05-23, Bress.net.

To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as [[Linux]] in [[Live USB]])<ref>[http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/USB-guide/x498.html Mass Storage Devices]. Linux-usb.sourceforge.net. Retrieved on 2011-05-18.</ref> or commonplace applications (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]) designed to run from flash drives. These are typically optimized for size and configured to place temporary or intermediate files in the computer's main RAM rather than store them temporarily on the flash drive.\n\nWhen used in the same manner as external rotating drives (hard drives, optical drives, or floppy drives), i.e. in ignorance of their technology, USB drives' failure is more likely to be sudden: while rotating drives ''can'' fail instantaneously, they more frequently give some indication (noises, slowness) that they are about to fail, often with enough advance warning that data can be removed before total failure. USB drives give little or no advance warning of failure. Furthermore, when internal wear-leveling is applied to prolong life of the flash drive, once failure of even part of the memory occurs it can be difficult or impossible to use the remainder of the drive, which differs from magnetic media, where bad sectors can be marked permanently not to be used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Notenboom |first=Leo A. |url=http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_fix_bad_sectors_on_a_flash_drive.html |title=How do I fix bad sectors on a flash drive? |website=Ask-leo.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\nMost USB flash drives do not include a [[write protection]] mechanism. This feature, which gradually became less common, consists of a switch on the housing of the drive itself, that prevents the host computer from writing or modifying data on the drive.  For example, write protection makes a device suitable for repairing [[computer virus|virus]]-contaminated host computers without the risk of infecting a USB flash drive itself.  In contrast to [[SD card]]s, write protection on USB flash drives (when available) is connected to the drive circuitry, and is handled by the drive itself instead of the host (on SD cards handling of the write-protection notch is optional).\n\nA drawback to the small size of flash drives is that they are easily misplaced or otherwise lost. This is a particular problem if they contain sensitive data (see [[data security]]). As a consequence, some manufacturers have added encryption hardware to their drives, although [[Comparison of disk encryption software|software encryption systems]] which can be used in conjunction with any [[mass storage]] medium will achieve the same result. Most drives can be attached to keychains or lanyards. The USB plug is usually retractable or fitted with a removable protective cap.\n\n====Storage capacity====\nStorage capacity of USB flash drives in 2019 was up to 2 TB while hard disks can be as large as 16 TB. As of 2011, USB flash drives were more expensive per unit of storage than large hard drives, but were less expensive in capacities of a few tens of gigabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storagesearch.com/semico-art1.html |title=Flash Memory vs. HDD - which will win? - SSD article on |website=Storagesearch.com |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Robustness====\nMost USB-based flash technology integrates a printed circuit board with a metal tip, which is simply soldered on. As a result, the stress point is where the two pieces join. The quality control of some manufacturers does not ensure a proper solder temperature, further weakening the stress point.<ref>[[Soldering#Electronics|Wikipedia entry \"Soldering Defects in Electronics]]</ref><ref>[[Cold solder joint|Wikipedia entry \"Processes \u2013 Electronic Components (PCBs)\"]]</ref> Since many flash drives stick out from computers, they are likely to be bumped repeatedly and may break at the stress point. Most of the time, a break at the stress point tears the joint from the printed circuit board and results in permanent damage. However, some manufacturers produce discreet flash drives that do not stick out, and others use a solid metal or plastic uni-body that has no easily discernible stress point.  SD cards serve as a good alternative to USB drives since they can be inserted flush.\n\n===Security threats===\n====BadUSB====\n{{Main|BadUSB}}\n\nFlash drives may present a significant security challenge for some organizations. Their small size and ease of use allows unsupervised visitors or employees to store and smuggle out confidential data with little chance of detection. Both corporate and public computers are vulnerable to attackers connecting a flash drive to a free USB port and using malicious software such as [[keyboard logger]]s or [[packet sniffer]]s.\n\nFor computers set up to be bootable from a USB drive, it is possible to use a flash drive containing a bootable portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if the computer is password protected. The password can then be changed, or it may be possible to crack the password with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer. Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.\n\nUSB flash drives may also be used deliberately or unwittingly to transfer [[malware]] and autorun [[computer worm|worms]] onto a network.\n\nSome organizations forbid the use of flash drives, and some computers are configured to disable the mounting of USB mass storage devices by users other than administrators; others use third-party software to control USB usage. The use of software allows the administrator to not only provide a USB lock but also control the use of CD-RW, SD cards and other memory devices. This enables companies with policies forbidding the use of USB flash drives in the workplace to enforce these policies. In a lower-tech security solution, some organizations disconnect USB ports inside the computer or fill the USB sockets with [[epoxy]].\n\nSome of the security measures taken to prevent confidential data from being taken have presented some side effects such as curtailing user privileges of recharging mobile devices off the USB ports on the systems.\n\n====USB killer====\n{{main|USB Killer}}\nIn appearance similar to a USB flash drive, a USB killer is a circuit that charges up [[capacitor]]s to a high voltage using the power supply pins of a [[USB#Connectors|USB port]] then discharges high voltage pulses onto the data pins. This completely standalone device can instantly and permanently damage or destroy any host hardware that it is connected to.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2896732/dont-trust-other-peoples-usb-flash-drives-they-could-fry-your-laptop.html\n |title=USB Killer is a flash drive designed to fry your laptop\n |last=Constantin\n |first=Lucian\n |date=Mar 13, 2015\n |website=[[PC World]]\n |access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===\"Flash Drives for Freedom\"===\nThe New York-based [[Human Rights Foundation]] collaborated with [[Forum 280]] and [[USB Memory Direct]] to launch the \"Flash Drives for Freedom\" program.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taggart |first1=Emma |title=You Can Donate Old USB Drives to These Activists to Help Free North Koreans of Propaganda |url=https://mymodernmet.com/north-korea-flash-drives-for-freedom/ |work=My Modern Met |accessdate=10 January 2019 |language=en |date=22 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Desreumaux |first1=Geoff |title=Flash Drives For Freedom: Your Old USB Drives Can Help Overthrow Dictatorships |url=https://wersm.com/flash-drives-for-freedom-your-old-usb-drives-can-help-overthrow-dictatorship/ |accessdate=10 January 2019 |work=WeRSM - We are Social Media |date=23 August 2018}}</ref> The program was created in 2016 to smuggle flash drives with [[United States|American]] and [[South Korea]]n movies and television shows, as well as a copy of the [[Korean language|Korean]] [[Wikipedia]], into [[North Korea]] to spread pro-Western sentiment.<ref name=\"theguardianflashdrivesforfreedom\">{{cite news|last1=Hands|first1=Jack|title=Flashdrives for freedom? 20,000 USBs to be smuggled into North Korea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/flashdrives-for-freedom-north-korea-20000-usb-sticks|accessdate=March 18, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=March 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"reasonhowactivistsareusing\">{{cite web|last1=Bragg|first1=Austin|last2=Bragg|first2=Meredith|last3=Detrick|first3=Paul|title=#SXSW: How Activists Are Using Technology to Fight Dictators|url=https://reason.com/reasontv/2017/03/15/sxsw-how-activists-are-using-technology|website=Reason Foundation|accessdate=March 18, 2017|date=March 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Naming==\nIn 2005, Microsoft was using the term \"USB Flash Drive\" as the common name for these devices when they introduced the ''Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20034 |title=Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager application |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Alternative names <!-- please do not add alternative names, see talk archives for long history -->are commonly used, many of which are trademarks of various manufacturers.\n\n==Current and future developments==\n[[File:USB 3.0 Flash Drive PCB.jpg|thumb|The internals of a 32&nbsp;GB [[Toshiba]] USB 3.0 flash drive.

film)|''Tarzan'']]. The songs on the soundtrack were composed by [[Phil Collins]], and the instrumental score by [[Mark Mancina]]. The song \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\" won both the [[72nd Academy Awards#Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1990s|Best Original Song]] and the [[57th Golden Globe Awards#Winners and nominees|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song#1990s|Best Original Song]] and received a [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media#Recipients|Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]], while the soundtrack album won a [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media#Recipients|Best Soundtrack Album]]. For his contribution to the soundtrack, Collins received an [[American Music Awards of 2000#Winners_and_nominees|American Music Award]] for [[American Music Award for Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist#2000s|Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist]].\n\n''Tarzan'' was the first Disney soundtrack to be recorded in multiple languages for different markets, with Collins recording English, Italian, German, Spanish, and French versions of the soundtrack. Collins was assisted by composer [[\u00c9ric Serra]] to record and produce the French versions of the songs.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe ''Tarzan'' soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on May 18, 1999. The soundtrack peaked at #5 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts during the week of July 10, 1999, coinciding with the film's theatrical run. The album was a major comeback for Phil Collins, and put him back in the public eye. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA promotion was held at the [[Disney Store]]. Customers who bought the soundtrack received a free and exclusive single of \"You'll Be in My Heart\". The soundtrack itself was labeled limited edition, including a holographic cover and an individual collector's number.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe album has sold 2,586,000 copies in the U.S. as of April 2014.<ref name=\"sales\">{{cite news |url=https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-sell-14k-albums-top-10-172855366.html |title=Chart Watch: Sell 14K Albums, Make The Top 10 |author= Paul Grein |date= April 30, 2014 |work=Yahoo Music }}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written and composed by [[Phil Collins]], with score composed by [[Mark Mancina]].\n{{track listing\n|lyrics_credits=\n|music_credits=\n| extra_column = Performer(s)\n| title1    = [[Two Worlds (song)|Two Worlds]]\n| length1   = 3:18\n| extra1    = [[Phil Collins]]\n| title2    = [[You'll Be in My Heart]]\n| length2   = 1:36\n| extra2    = Collins and [[Glenn Close]]\n| title3    = [[Son of Man (song)|Son of Man]]\n| length3   = 2:44\n| extra3    = Collins\n| title5    = Trashin' the Camp\n| length5   = 2:16\n| extra5    =[[Rosie O'Donnell]] and Collins\n| title4    = [[Strangers Like Me]]\n| extra4    = Collins\n| length4   = 3:00\n| title6    = Two Worlds \n| note6     = Reprise\n| extra6    = Collins\n| length6   = 0:51\n| title7    = Trashin' the Camp\n| extra7    = Collins and [[NSYNC]]\n| length7   = 2:23\n| title8    = You'll Be in My Heart\n| note8     = end credits\n| extra8    = Collins\n| length8   = 4:18\n| title9    = Two Worlds\n| note9     = Radio version\n| extra9    = Collins\n| length9   = 2:42\n| title10   = A Wondrous Place\n| note10    = Score\n| length10  = 5:18\n| title11   = Moves Like an Ape, Looks Like a Man\n| note11    = Score\n| length11  = 2:57\n| title12   = The Gorillas\n| note12    = Score\n| length12  = 4:28\n| title13   = One Family\n| note13    = Score\n| length13  = 3:48\n| title14   = Two Worlds \n| note14    = Finale\n| extra14   = Collins\n| length14  = 1:16\n|total_length=40:55}}\n\n==Charts==\n\n===Album===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006.<ref name=Ekushey>{{Cite news |date=2006-02-20 |title=13 get Ekushey Padak |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/02/20/d60220011511.htm |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers.

Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972.

Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet.

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006.<ref name=Ekushey>{{Cite news |date=2006-02-20 |title=13 get Ekushey Padak |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/02/20/d60220011511.htm |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the doorstep. \n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla (Onslaught)'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park.

Majority of Khan\u2019s sculptures are made of bronze and steel. He also worked with stone, aluminum, white granite, marble and mixed-media. His large-scale sculptures are mostly made of concrete and bronze. Though majority of his early sculptures were built in the expressionist style, his works after 2000 reflect minimalism with constant exploration for purity of forms and material. The composition of his sculptures is characterized by architectural and geometric shapes.<ref name=Critics>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=87-90 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> The war remembrance theme continued in Khan through 1985 till 1988, in different styles.

A year after losing to [[1918 Georgia Tech Golden Tornado football team|Georgia Tech]] 128 to 0, the Aggies managed to achieve their largest win margin in history, a 100-0 shutout of Hampton Roads Navy, one of the many highlights of NC State's turnaround 1919 season.  Besides a 0 to 49 pounding against final 7-1 record [[1919 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] in Annapolis, the Aggies did very well against their schedule.  5 games could be considered blowouts, although the 3-0 squeaker against [[1919 VPI Gobblers football team|VPI]] wasn't much of a lopsided game.  NC State went 3-1 against conference opponents, playing [[1919 North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] for the first time since 1905, and losing by a single point.  For the first time, NC state would achieve a seven-win season, which would not be surpassed until 1927.\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 27\n| w/l = w\n|

It was written for the screen by [[Randi Mayem Singer]] and [[Leslie Dixon]], based on the novel ''[[Madame Doubtfire|Alias Madame Doubtfire]]'' by [[Anne Fine]]. [[Robin Williams]], who also served as a co-producer, stars with [[Sally Field]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], and [[Robert Prosky]]. It follows a recently divorced actor who dresses up as a female housekeeper to be able to interact with his children. The film addresses themes of divorce, separation, and the effect they have on a family.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 24, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mrsdoubtfire.htm|title=Mrs. Doubtfire|publisher=Box Office Mojo|language=English|date=24 November 1993|accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]<ref name=awardformrsdoubtfire>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107614/awards Awards for Mrs. Doubtfire].

Robin Williams was awarded the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]].\n\nIt grossed $441.3 million on a $25 million budget, becoming the [[1993 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 1993 worldwide]]. Though the film received mixed reviews, it was placed 67th in the [[American Film Institute]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]]\" list and 40th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s \"100 Funniest Movies of All Time\". The original music score was composed by [[Howard Shore]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e Miniature et Cin\u00e9ma - Doubtfire.jpg|thumb|Robin Williams' mask at the {{ill|Mus\u00e9e Miniature et Cin\u00e9ma|fr}}, [[Lyon]].]]\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be 400 to 700 words only. -->\nAlthough Daniel Hillard, a freelance [[voice actor]], is a devoted father to his three children, Lydia, Chris, and Natalie, his wife Miranda considers him unreliable. Daniel quits his job after a disagreement over a questionable script and returns home to throw a chaotic birthday party for Chris, which Miranda objects to. It proves to be the final straw for Miranda, who files for divorce. The court grants sole custody of the children to Miranda; shared custody is contingent on whether Daniel finds a steady job and a suitable residence within three months.\n\nAs Daniel works to rebuild his life, securing himself an apartment and a new job as a shipping clerk at a TV station, he learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper. He secretly alters her classified ad form, effectively barring any communication between Miranda and potential candidates for the position. Utilizing his voice acting skills, he calls Miranda while posing as a series of undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as \"Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\", a <!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT DISCUSSION! -->Scottish-accented nanny with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's partner, Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after a successful interview. The children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this later creates another barrier for him to see his children, as Miranda puts more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him and cannot bring herself to dismiss her. One night, Lydia and Chris inadvertently discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel. Thrilled to have their father back, they agree to keep his secret.\n\nWhile working one day, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel for a dinner to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stuart Dunmeyer, which Mrs. Doubtfire is expected to attend. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel changes in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events, consuming several alcoholic drinks in the process. Daniel eventually becomes drunk and slips up when he accidentally returns to Lundy in his costume, but he quickly claims that the character \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is his idea for the show. After overhearing that Stu is allergic to pepper, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu's order of [[jambalaya]] with powdered [[cayenne pepper]]. Stu chokes on his dinner, and Daniel, feeling guilty, gives him the [[Heimlich maneuver]] as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda who storms out of the restaurant with the kids.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, then explains his actions. The judge, while sympathetic to Daniel, is disturbed by his ruse, and grants Miranda full custody, further restricting Daniel's rights to supervised Saturday visits, which devastates him.\n\nWithout Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They are then surprised to learn that Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, is hosting a new children's show called ''Euphegenia's House,'' which becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.\n\nMiranda visits Daniel on set one afternoon, admitting that things were better when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody arrangement. Soon after, she and Daniel share joint custody, allowing him to take the children after school, essentially the same way he had done as Mrs. Doubtfire. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' in which Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying that love makes a family a family, no matter the distance between its members.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\n* [[Sally Field]] as Miranda Hillard\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Frank Hillard\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Gloria Cheney\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Lydia Hillard\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Chris Hillard\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Natalie \"Nattie\" Hillard\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Mr. Jonathan Lundy\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Mrs. Sellner\n* [[Scott Capurro]] as Jack\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Justin Gregory\n* [[Terence McGovern]] as ADR Director Lou \n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Mr. Sprinkles\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Judge\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mrs doubtfire house san francisco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[San Francisco]] house used for exterior shots of the film, photographed in August 2014, several days after [[Robin Williams]]'s death; a fan-made tribute to Williams can be seen at its front steps.]]\nProduction of the film was in [[San Francisco]].

In February 1994, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the censors refused to give the film a U or PG certificate, and gave it a 12 instead, which was due to [[20th Century Fox]] refusing to remove three controversial lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/film-stars-lost-for-words-but-why-does-mrs-doubtfire-have-to-swear-asks-david-lister-1393822.html|title=Film stars lost for words: But why does Mrs Doubtfire have to swear? asks David Lister|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=13 February 1994}}</ref>\n\nAfter the film's distributors requested the BBFC to reconsider a compromise was reached in which the film was re-rated PG, with the thirteen seconds of sexual innuendos cut, and it was re-released in May 1994.

He blamed the script not being right as the reason why a sequel was not made. He claimed the script had been written three times and failed, and there was no mention of any ongoing work on the project. Furthermore, in December 2011, during an interview by ''Moviehole,'' Williams stated again that the chances of a sequel are \"highly unlikely.\"\n\nIn 2011, Williams said:{{cquote|They could never write it.

Daniel quits his job after a disagreement over a questionable script and returns home to throw a chaotic birthday party for Chris, which Miranda objects to. It proves to be the final straw for Miranda, who files for divorce. The court grants sole custody of the children to Miranda; shared custody is contingent on whether Daniel finds a steady job and a suitable residence within three months.\n\nAs Daniel works to rebuild his life, securing himself an apartment and a new job as a shipping clerk at a TV station, he learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper. He secretly alters her classified ad form, effectively barring any communication between Miranda and potential candidates for the position. Utilizing his voice acting skills, he calls Miranda while posing as a series of undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as \"Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\", a <!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT DISCUSSION! -->Scottish-accented nanny with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's partner, Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after a successful interview. The children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this later creates another barrier for him to see his children, as Miranda puts more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him and cannot bring herself to dismiss her. One night, Lydia and Chris inadvertently discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel. Thrilled to have their father back, they agree to keep his secret.\n\nWhile working one day, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel for a dinner to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stuart Dunmeyer, which Mrs. Doubtfire is expected to attend. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel changes in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events, consuming several alcoholic drinks in the process. Daniel eventually becomes drunk and slips up when he accidentally returns to Lundy in his costume, but he quickly claims that the character \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is his idea for the show. After overhearing that Stu is allergic to pepper, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu's order of [[jambalaya]] with powdered [[cayenne pepper]]. Stu chokes on his dinner, and Daniel, feeling guilty, gives him the [[Heimlich maneuver]] as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda who storms out of the restaurant with the kids.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, then explains his actions. The judge, while sympathetic to Daniel, is disturbed by his ruse, and grants Miranda full custody, further restricting Daniel's rights to supervised Saturday visits, which devastates him.\n\nWithout Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They are then surprised to learn that Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, is hosting a new children's show called ''Euphegenia's House,'' which becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.\n\nMiranda visits Daniel on set one afternoon, admitting that things were better when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody arrangement. Soon after, she and Daniel share joint custody, allowing him to take the children after school, essentially the same way he had done as Mrs. Doubtfire. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' in which Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying that love makes a family a family, no matter the distance between its members.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\n* [[Sally Field]] as Miranda Hillard\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Frank Hillard\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Gloria Cheney\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Lydia Hillard\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Chris Hillard\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Natalie \"Nattie\" Hillard\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Mr. Jonathan Lundy\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Mrs. Sellner\n* [[Scott Capurro]] as Jack\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Justin Gregory\n* [[Terence McGovern]] as ADR Director Lou \n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Mr. Sprinkles\n* [[Scott Beach]] as Judge\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mrs doubtfire house san francisco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[San Francisco]] house used for exterior shots of the film, photographed in August 2014, several days after [[Robin Williams]]'s death; a fan-made tribute to Williams can be seen at its front steps.]]\nProduction of the film was in [[San Francisco]].

[[Robin Williams]] was set to return in disguise as an old nanny. Due to problems with the script, re-writing began in 2006, because Williams was unhappy with the plot, and the sequel was again scrapped later that year. The film was expected to be released in late 2007, but following further script problems, the sequel was declared scrapped in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=1664&count=0 |title=Williams Rejects Mrs. Doubtfire Sequel |publisher=WorstPreviews.com |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, in an ''[[Newsday]]'' interview, Williams said the sequel was indefinitely scrapped.

He blamed the script not being right as the reason why a sequel was not made. He claimed the script had been written three times and failed, and there was no mention of any ongoing work on the project. Furthermore, in December 2011, during an interview by ''Moviehole,'' Williams stated again that the chances of a sequel are \"highly unlikely.\"\n\nIn 2011, Williams said:{{cquote|They could never write it.
