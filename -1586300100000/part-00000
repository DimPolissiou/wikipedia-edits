When Michaela's partner is unavailable due to a \"busted pipe,\" Jared reluctantly follows Michaela's instincts and they interrupt the [[BATF|ATF]]'s undercover operation. Jared takes responsibility for his decision and is suspended. Grace learns the life insurance company intends to recollect the $500K which they paid her after Ben's disappearance and presumed death. Ben meets Grace's ex-boyfriend Danny after Olive was detained for attempting to shoplift a lipstick from a cosmetic store. Thomas escaped from the institution and the NSA is searching for him. With help from Michaela and Saanvi, Bethany correctly interprets the clues from Michaela's vision and they find Thomas. Bethany explains that Leo went missing two years after their flight disappeared, leaving no one to meet Thomas.

After advice from her father, Michaela goes to speak to Jared at a bar. Ben and Cal learn from Bethany's wife Georgia that she got picked up by the NSA. Michaela learns from Ben about Cal not hearing voices like they do but still having abilities that manifest in a different way, causing Ben to dedicate himself to figuring the mystery out.

He and Michaela review footage from the night the plane landed and see passengers loaded onto five buses, but only four arrived at their intended destination. The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing. The buses were contracted by Unified Dynamic Systems (UDS), a large corporation involved in many industries. After getting some information from a translator, Michaela locates a farm where UDS is experimenting on the eleven passengers, but she and Jared are chased away by armed men. Ben confronts Vance about the missing passengers, believing the NSA is behind their disappearance and threatens to tell the press. Although Vance has dossiers on the eleven passengers showing they are accounted for, he leads a team to investigate the farm location.

Michaela recognizes the gunman as an 828 passenger named Logan Strickland who has shared the death date calling. They try to calm him and persuade the [[Emergency Service Unit|ESU]] to wait while they ensure he gets into the safety deposit box he is after. At the same time, Ben and TJ work through a separate calling that leads them to Logan's brother Frank. Frank has the key to the safety deposit box and Ben takes him to the bank. Inside the box is a compass with a bullet in it that saved Logan and Frank's grandfather during World War II. Logan believes it will save his life too, and he gives it to Michaela for safekeeping while he is incarcerated. Having learned about the death date, TJ is upset and Olive takes him to the Church of the Returned for hope. Following the incident at the bank, Jared meets Tamara for a date. Meanwhile, the Major realizes she's been exposed and has Saanvi's research stolen from her lab and home.

While being treated at the hospital, Ben and Grace learn their baby is a girl and assume the calling was about her. Ben and TJ review events and realize the Xer attacks have been carefully planned to divert police manpower. Olive tells Michaela what she saw and identifies a suspect, who directs the police to a meeting place for Xers.

She further praised the series for maintaining the standard of quality it set with its premiere episode saying, \"Heavily serialized shows, such as ''Lost'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', or ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' often start with a great concept and first episode.

The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing.

Saanvi's latest experiment results in the elimination of the mutation. Meanwhile, numerous 828 passengers are invited to an event at the club where Isaiah works, with an offer of free champagne.

Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside.
