It was released in October 2003, and peaked at #36 in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]].\n\n== Background and recording ==\n\nThe band departed from bankrupt [[Beyond Records]] and signed with [[Sony Music]]. ''The Curse of Blondie'' had the working title ''Phasm 8'', which was also the name of the tour they were doing before the release. [[Craig Leon]], who had also produced their previous hit album ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'', started work on the album, but it was four years in the making as the only demo tapes of the album had disappeared from luggage at a UK airport, and so had to be re-recorded.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Leon ultimately did not produce the album, which was largely helmed by [[Steve Thompson (musician)|Steve Thompson]] with [[Jeff Bova]] producing only one track, \"[[Good Boys (song)|Good Boys]]\".\n\nThe album incorporates a rock-inspired arrangement style more reminiscent of Blondie's earliest recordings. Rhythms played include mostly rock (\"Golden Rod, \"Rules for Living\", \"End to End\", \"Hello Joe\", \"Last One in the World\", \"Diamond Bridge\") and then [[dance-pop]] (\"Good Boys\", \"[[Undone (Blondie song)|Undone]]\", \"The Tingler\"). Other incursions are [[Japan]]ese [[Okinawan music|traditional music]] (\"Magic (Asadoya Yunta)\"), [[reggae]] (\"Background Melody (The Only One)\"), [[jazz]] (\"Desire Brings Me Back\", \"Songs of Love (For Richard)\") and [[rap]] (\"Shakedown\"). The track \"Hello Joe\" is an homage to [[Joey Ramone]], and includes a reference to \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\" (\"hey ho, \u00a1hola Joe!\" instead of \"hey ho, let's go!\").\n\n==Release==\n\nThe album was released with various bonus tracks in some territories, while the US edition included the [[music video]] for the single \"Good Boys\".

Following its release in 2003, Blondie embarked into a two years long international world tour, playing more than 160 gigs in Europe, Asia, the three Americas and Oceania.

Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.
