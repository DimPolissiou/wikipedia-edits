The genus has remained a wastebasket, with numerous species still included under the label ''\u2018Steneosaurus\u2019'', many of which are unrelated to each other (either [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]] with respect to each other and other genera of teleosauroids).\n\nThe [[type species]], '''''S. rostromajor''''', was only formally recognised as such in 2020, and this revision determined the [[type specimen]] of ''Steneosaurus'' was undiagnostic, and so declared the genus ''Steneosaurus'' a ''nomen dubium''.

Banks became the first Chairman, and Brock became the first Secretary. Other notable founder members included: actor [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]], Professor [[John Le Patourel]], [[William Arnold (Bailiff)|Sir William Arnold]] and Professor [[Herbert John Fleure|Herbert Fleure]].<ref>Brock, H Le M, ''Twenty One Years Ago'', Quarterly Review of the Guernsey Society, 1964</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nThe Society has published a regular magazine since 1945. ''The Bulletin'' appeared eight times during 1945 and 1946.

Some also have an apparent mestizo look to them. The reason for this phenomenon is due to the migration of many Taino Indians during the Spanish colonization. Many Tainos fled to the mountainous region to escape slavery. Many poor Spanish and other European immigrants moved to this region as well and settled as coffee growers. Eventually, the Taino and European immigrants intermarried and created what is called the \"[[mestizo]]\".\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Mayoralty in Puerto Rico}}\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a [[mayor]], elected every four years.

Barranquitas is spread over 6 wards and Barranquitas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nBarranquitas is about one hour by winding roads from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], the capital.

Some also have an apparent mestizo look to them. The reason for this phenomenon is due to the migration of many Taino Indians during the Spanish colonization. Many Tainos fled to the mountainous region to escape slavery. Many poor Spanish and other European immigrants moved to this region as well and settled as coffee growers. Eventually, the Taino and European immigrants intermarried and created what is called the \"[[mestizo]]\".\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Mayoralty in Puerto Rico}}\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a [[mayor]], elected every four years.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex).

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.
