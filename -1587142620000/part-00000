{"title_page": "Environmental journalism", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=January 2010}}\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\n'''Environmental journalism''' is the collection, verification, production, distribution and exhibition of information regarding current events, trends, and issues associated with the non-human world. To be an environmental journalist, one must have an understanding of scientific language. The individual needs to put to use their knowledge of historical environmental events. One must have the ability to follow environmental policy decisions and environmental organizations. An environmental journalist should have a general understanding of current environmental concerns, and the ability to communicate information to the public in a way that is easily understood.\n\nEnvironmental journalism falls within the scope of [[environmental communication]]. Its roots can be traced to [[nature writing]]. One controversy in environmental journalism is, how to distinguish the genre from its allied disciplines.\n\n== History ==\n\nWhile the practice of nature writing has a rich history that dates back at least as far as the [[exploration narratives]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and follows tradition up through prominent nature writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the late 19th century, [[John Burroughs]] and [[John Muir]] in the early 20th century, and [[Aldo Leopold]] in the 1940s, the field of environmental journalism did not begin to take shape until the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe growth of environmental journalism as a profession roughly parallels that of the environmental movement, which became a mainstream cultural movement with the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''Silent Spring'' in 1962 and was further legitimized by the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.  Grassroots environmental organizations made a booming appearance on the political scene in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of what many considered to be the \"environmental crisis\", and working to influence [[environmental policy]] decisions.  The mass media has followed and generated public interest on environmental issues ever since.\n\nThe field of environmental journalism was further legitimized by the creation of the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] [http://www.sej.org] in 1990, whose mission \"is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality, accuracy, and visibility of environmental reporting.\"   Today, academic programs are offered at a number of institutions to train budding journalists in the rigors, complexity and sheer breadth of environmental journalism.\n\n==Advocacy debate==\n\nThere exists a minor rift in the community of environmental journalists.  Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though not at the expense of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue.   This debate is not likely to be settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.\n\n==Genres==\n{{See also|Environmental Media Awards|The British Environment and Media Awards|List of environmental books}}\n\n=== Environmental communication ===\n{{main|Environmental communication}}\nEnvironmental communication is all of the forms of communication that are engaged with the social debate about environmental issues and problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theieca.org/|title=What is Environmental Communication?|author=Meisner, Mark|publisher=Environmental Communication Network|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>\n\nAlso within the scope of environmental communication are the genres of [[nature writing]], science writing, environmental literature, environmental interpretation and environmental advocacy.  While there is a great deal of overlap among the various genres within environmental communication, they are each deserving of their own definition.\n\n===Nature writing===\n{{Main|Nature writing}}\n\nNature writing is the genre with the longest history in environmental communication. In his book, ''This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing'', Thomas J. Lyon attempts to use a \"taxonomy of nature writing\" in order to define the genre.  He suggests that his classifications, too, suffer a great deal of overlap and intergrading. \"The literature of nature has three main dimensions to it: natural history information, personal responses to nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature\" (Lyon 20). In the natural history essay, \"the main burden of the writing is to convey pointed instruction in the facts of nature,\" such as with the ramble-type nature writing of John Burroughs (Lyon 21). \"In essays of experience, the author's firsthand contact with nature is the frame for the writing,\" as with Edward Abbey's contemplation of a desert sunset (Lyon 23). In the philosophical interpretation of nature, the content is similar to that of the natural history and personal experience essays, \"but the mode of presentation tends to be more abstract and scholarly\" (Lyon 25). ''The Norton Book of Nature Writing'' adds a few new dimensions to the genre of nature writing, including animal narratives, garden essays, farming essays, ecofeminist works, writing on environmental justice, and works advocating environmental preservation, sustainability and biological diversity.  Environmental journalism pulls from the tradition and scope of nature writing.\n\n===Science writing===\n{{See also|Popular science}}\n\nScience writing is writing that focuses specifically on topics of scientific study, generally translating jargon that is difficult for those outside a particular scientific field to understand into language that is easily digestible.  This genre can be narrative or informative.  Not all science writing falls within the bounds of environmental communication, only science writing that takes on topics relevant to the environment. Environmental journalism also pulls from the tradition and scope of science writing.\n\n===Environmental interpretation===\n{{See also|Heritage interpretation}}\n\nEnvironmental interpretation is a particular format for the communication of relevant information.  It \"involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren't scientists can readily understand.  And it involves doing it in a way that's entertaining and interesting to these people\" (Ham 3). Environmental interpretation is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason to learn more about the topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8\u201328). While environmental journalism is not derived from environmental interpretation, it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.\n\n===Environmental literature===\n{{see also|Outdoor literature}}\nEnvironmental literature is writing that comments intelligently on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society and the environment.  Most nature writing and some science writing falls within the scope of environmental literature.  Often, environmental literature is understood to espouse care and concern for the environment, thus advocating a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man to nature.  Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature\n\n===Environmental advocacy===\n{{See also|Environmentalism}}\n\nEnvironmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews.  Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication.  It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.\n\n==Topics==\n\nThe field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics.  According to ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'', environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues.  The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.\n\nEnvironmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:\n\nFrom ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'':\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Air pollution]] (Outdoor)\n* Air pollution ([[Indoor air quality|Indoor]])\n* [[Animal waste]] management\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Brownfields]] (\"former industrial and commercial sites\" (104))\n* [[Cancer]] and other disease cluster claims\n* [[Chemical emergencies]]\n* [[Chemical weapons]] (Disarmament)\n* [[Children's health]] ([[Asthma]])\n* Children's health ([[Lead]])\n* Cross-border environmental issues (U.S.-Mexico)\n* [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|Dioxin]]\n* Disposal of [[dredged material]]s\n* [[Endocrine disruptor]]s (\"also called a hormonally active agent, [it] is a chemical that interferes with the functioning of the endocrine system\" (172))\n* [[Environmental justice]] and [[hazardous waste]]\n* [[Food irradiation]]\n* [[Genetically modified crops]]\n* [[Global warming]] and [[climate change]]\n* [[Groundwater pollution]]\n* Naturally occurring and technology-based disasters\n* [[Occupational health]]\n* [[Ozone]] depletion\n* [[Pesticides]]\n* [[Pollution prevention]]/Source reduction\n* [[Population growth]]\n* [[Urban sprawl|Sprawl]] and [[environmental health]]\n* [[Surface water]] [[water quality|quality]]\n* [[Water supply]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nFrom [http://www.envirolink.org EnviroLink]:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Agriculture]]\n* [[Air quality]]\n* [[Climate change]]\n* [[Ecosystems]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Environmental disaster]]s\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Environmental education]]\n* [[Environmental ethics]]\n* [[Environmental law|Environmental legislation]] and [[environmental policy]]\n* [[Forests]]\n* [[Ground pollution]]\n* [[Habitat conservation]]\n* [[Natural history]]\n* [[Outdoor recreation]]\n* [[Population]]\n* [[Sciences]]\n* [[Social Sciences]] and [[humanities]]\n* [[Sustainable development]]\n* [[Sustainable living]]\n* [[Transportation]]\n* Urban issues\n* [[Vegetarianism]]\n* [[Waste management]]\n* [[Water quality]]\n* [[Wildlife]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Journalism|Environment}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Advocacy journalism]]\n* [[Conservation Commons]]\n* [[Conservation movement]]\n* [[Dean v.

Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature\n\n===Environmental advocacy===\n{{See also|Environmentalism}}\n\nEnvironmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews.  Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication.  It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.\n\n==Topics==\n\nThe field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics.  According to ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'', environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues.  The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.\n\nEnvironmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:\n\nFrom ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'':\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Air pollution]] (Outdoor)\n* Air pollution ([[Indoor air quality|Indoor]])\n* [[Animal waste]] management\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Brownfields]] (\"former industrial and commercial sites\" (104))\n* [[Cancer]] and other disease cluster claims\n* [[Chemical emergencies]]\n* [[Chemical weapons]] (Disarmament)\n* [[Children's health]] ([[Asthma]])\n* Children's health ([[Lead]])\n* Cross-border environmental issues (U.S.-Mexico)\n* [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|Dioxin]]\n* Disposal of [[dredged material]]s\n* [[Endocrine disruptor]]s (\"also called a hormonally active agent, [it] is a chemical that interferes with the functioning of the endocrine system\" (172))\n* [[Environmental justice]] and [[hazardous waste]]\n* [[Food irradiation]]\n* [[Genetically modified crops]]\n* [[Global warming]] and [[climate change]]\n* [[Groundwater pollution]]\n* Naturally occurring and technology-based disasters\n* [[Occupational health]]\n* [[Ozone]] depletion\n* [[Pesticides]]\n* [[Pollution prevention]]/Source reduction\n* [[Population growth]]\n* [[Urban sprawl|Sprawl]] and [[environmental health]]\n* [[Surface water]] [[water quality|quality]]\n* [[Water supply]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nFrom [http://www.envirolink.org EnviroLink]:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Agriculture]]\n* [[Air quality]]\n* [[Climate change]]\n* [[Ecosystems]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Environmental disaster]]s\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Environmental education]]\n* [[Environmental ethics]]\n* [[Environmental law|Environmental legislation]] and [[environmental policy]]\n* [[Forests]]\n* [[Ground pollution]]\n* [[Habitat conservation]]\n* [[Natural history]]\n* [[Outdoor recreation]]\n* [[Population]]\n* [[Sciences]]\n* [[Social Sciences]] and [[humanities]]\n* [[Sustainable development]]\n* [[Sustainable living]]\n* [[Transportation]]\n* Urban issues\n* [[Vegetarianism]]\n* [[Waste management]]\n* [[Water quality]]\n* [[Wildlife]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Journalism|Environment}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Advocacy journalism]]\n* [[Conservation Commons]]\n* [[Conservation movement]]\n* [[Dean v.
