({{lang-es|Convento Real de Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda y Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Merced}}) is a church in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]] of [[Mexico City]], Mexico. Originally a convent for orphaned and undowried girls, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda was the third [[Conceptionists|Conceptionist]] convent in Mexico City when it was formed in 1580. Its founders were granted financial support from [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]], who planned to make Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda a leading convent in [[New Spain]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:ParishJyMMercedDF.JPG|thumb|Exterior, 2009]]\n[[File:Mexico City (2018) - 243.jpg|thumb|Interior, 2018]]\n[[File:CupolaJyMMercedDF.JPG|thumb|The church's [[cupola]] in 2009]]\n\nDuring the 16th century, Archbishop [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]] was concerned with the growing presence of orphaned girls in Mexico City. Most of these girls were children or grandchildren of Spanish [[Conquistador|''conquistadores'']] or early New Spain settlers. Since their parents did not have enough [[Dowry|dowries]] to marry them, these girls remained single and were not admitted into suitable convents, as dowries were often necessary to financially support convents.{{sfn|Poole|2012|p=67\u201371}}\n\nTo alleviate the conditions of undowried women, layperson [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de Denia]] founded the convent with the help of Gregorio Pesquera. Pesquera initially contributed with a significant financial donation; de Denia sought more money by creating a fundraiser in Mexico's northern mines.

Originally a convent for orphaned and undowried girls, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda was the third [[Conceptionists|Conceptionist]] convent in Mexico City when it was formed in 1580. Its founders were granted financial support from [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]], who planned to make Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda a leading convent in [[New Spain]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:ParishJyMMercedDF.JPG|thumb|Exterior, 2009]]\n[[File:Mexico City (2018) - 243.jpg|thumb|Interior, 2018]]\n[[File:CupolaJyMMercedDF.JPG|thumb|The church's [[cupola]] in 2009]]\n\nDuring the 16th century, Archbishop [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]] was concerned with the growing presence of orphaned girls in Mexico City. Most of these girls were children or grandchildren of Spanish [[Conquistador|''conquistadores'']] or early New Spain settlers. Since their parents did not have enough [[Dowry|dowries]] to marry them, these girls remained single and were not admitted into suitable convents, as dowries were often necessary to financially support convents.{{sfn|Poole|2012|p=67\u201371}}\n\nTo alleviate the conditions of undowried women, layperson [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de Denia]] founded the convent with the help of Gregorio Pesquera. Pesquera initially contributed with a significant financial donation; de Denia sought more money by creating a fundraiser in Mexico's northern mines. Both eventually garnered the interest of [[Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almanza]] and Moya de Contreras to help contribute to the project. The archbishop asked citizens to contribute to the project.{{sfn|Poole|2012|p=67\u201371}} Enough money was eventually raised, and Denia bought the building from an agency managed by ''[[oidor]]'' Pedro Farf\u00e1n, on 11 April 1578.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdigital.dgb.uanl.mx/la/1080018115/1080018115_21.pdf|title=M\u00e9xico Viejo: El convento de Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda (Cap\u00edtulo XVI)|last=Gonz\u00e1lez Obreg\u00f3n|first=Luis|date=1979|publisher=[[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]|language=Spanish}}</ref> Moya de Contreras then transferred ten nuns from another convent to help run Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda.

The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.

This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] was liquidated in 2010, after a 114-year history. It was reformed as [[Ilkeston F.C.]] in 2011, which was in turn liquidated in 2017. \nIn July 2017 a new club, [[Ilkeston Town F.C.]] founded by Notts County chairman Alan Hardy, replaced the liquidated Ilkeston FC, and will play at the New Manor Ground in Ilkeston.\n\nLocal rugby club Ilkeston RUFC - known as the \"Elks\" - formed in 1926. The home ground in the town is called The Stute.\n\nThere are also two main basketball teams situated in Ilkeston; the Ilkeston Hawks and Ilkeston Falcons.

The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent. Gilbert also controlled nearby [[Shipley, Derbyshire|Shipley]], [[West Hallam]] and [[Stanton by Dale]].<ref name = \"Domesday1\">''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.  The last casting was an emotional event in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=33797 |title=Archived Report - Stanton & Staveley Iron Foundry... the most epic foundry to date - UK Urban Exploration Forums |publisher=28dayslater.co.uk |date=20 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165015/http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=33797 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The huge Stanton site has been partially given over to business park and the rest of the site is earmarked for redevelopment which is subject to local opposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greensqueeze.org.uk/node/1 |title=fighting to protect the Erewash countryside |publisher=Green Squeeze |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018191912/http://www.greensqueeze.org.uk/node/1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ilkeston Charter fair==\nIlkeston Market Place is the site of a [[Charter fair]].<ref>[http://www.ilkestonfair.co.uk/ilkfair/ilkfairhist.htm History of Ilkeston Fair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219100552/http://www.ilkestonfair.co.uk/ilkfair/ilkfairhist.htm |date=19 December 2009 }}</ref> The fair celebrated its 760th anniversary in 2012, the Charter being granted by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1252. This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] was liquidated in 2010, after a 114-year history. It was reformed as [[Ilkeston F.C.]] in 2011, which was in turn liquidated in 2017. \nIn July 2017 a new club, [[Ilkeston Town F.C.]] founded by Notts County chairman Alan Hardy, replaced the liquidated Ilkeston FC, and will play at the New Manor Ground in Ilkeston.\n\nLocal rugby club Ilkeston RUFC - known as the \"Elks\" - formed in 1926. The home ground in the town is called The Stute.\n\nThere are also two main basketball teams situated in Ilkeston; the Ilkeston Hawks and Ilkeston Falcons.
