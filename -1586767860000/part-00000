On the proper left side of the slab, another winged figure sits wearing a long dress, a bodice, and a scarf around her head to represent the angel of [[Peace]].

His father was a [[stonemason]], which led to Connor's jobs in New York as a sign painter, stonecutter, bronze founder, and machinist. Inspired by his father's work and his own experience, Connor used to steal his father's chisels as a child and carve figures into rocks.\n\nIn 1899, he moved into the [[Roycroft Institution]] where he helped with [[blacksmithing]] and eventually began making [[terracotta]] busts and reliefs. During four years at Roycroft, he became well known as a sculptor, and was commissioned to create civic works in bronze for placement in Washington, D.C., [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[East Aurora, New York]], San Francisco, and Ireland.\n\nIn 1925, he moved back to Ireland and opened his own studio in [[Dublin]], but found few patrons and his work slowed.

Proposing the sculpture just after the turn of the century, her request was denied by the War Department until proof of service was provided. For ten years Jolly worked to gather evidence and presented it to Congress in 1918.<ref name=\"Testament\"/>\n\nThe sculpture was authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on March 29, 1918 with the agreement that the government would not fund it.

[[Jerome Connor]] wanted the sculpture either at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] or at the [[Pan American Union Building]]. Neither choice was supported by the War Department or the DC Fine Arts Commission and the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] decided on the final location near [[Dupont Circle]]. Once the location was chosen, the Arts Commission requested that the sculpture be changed by Connor. They requested that he alter the size, move inscriptions on the front, rearrange the front steps and make the angels \"active.\" A year later, in 1919, Congress finally approved of the design.<ref name=\"Testament\"/> Construction began on July 28, 1924.<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\nFinally, [[Jerome Connor]] ended up suing the Ancient Order of the Hibernians for nonpayment.<ref name=\"SOS\"/>\n\nThe monument was dedicated on September 20, 1924 as part of a weekend long meeting of over 5,000 Catholics from all over the country. One nun, Sister Magdeline of the Sisters of Mercy, who served in the Civil War attended the event and was received with a \"thunderous applause.\" [[William Henry O'Connell|Archbishop O'Connell]] of Boston spoke and upon finishing, Jolly revealed the sculpture by removing an [[American flag]] that covered it.

It is planned to be cleared as part of the [[Hambach surface mine]] by owner [[RWE AG]]. There have been ongoing protests and occupations to prevent this since 2012.\n\n[[File:Cut forest digger in bkgrd.jpg|thumb|Area of destroyed forest with excavator]]\n[[File:Hambach surface mine and Hambach Forest.png|thumb|[[Hambach surface mine]] ({{color|gray}}); remaining '''Hambach Forest''' in the south (NE of Morschenich ([[:de:Morschenich|de]])); recultivated [[Sophienh\u00f6he]] in NW, 2017<ref name=\"Map_2017\"/>]]\n\n== The forest ==\n[[File:Myotis_bechsteinii-flying1.jpg|thumb|Hambach Forest's rare [[Bechstein's bat]] population is threatened.]]\nHambach Forest is rich in biodiversity and home to 142 species regarded as important for conservation.\nThe forest has been called ''\"the last remnant of a sylvan ecosystem that has occupied this part of the Rhine River plain between Aachen and Cologne since the end of the last ice age\"''.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> Only ten percent of Hambach Forest still remains, and the remaining forest is severely threatened by mining for brown coal.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> Of special interest is the rare [[Bechstein's bat]] population, which is strictly protected according to annex II and annex IV of the European [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=\"BAT_2018\"/>\nAn [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] study has never been conducted. The {{ill|Administrative Court Cologne{{!}}Administrative Court|de|Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln}} in [[Cologne]] denied the necessity of such a study in November 2017 because the permission for the mining operations was given in the 1970s, long before Environmental Impact Assessment studies became mandatory.<ref name=\"VGK\u00f6ln_2017\"/><ref name=\"RegArnsberg_2018\"/>\n\n[[File:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier DE.png|thumb|Lignite mining in the area, as of 2018. [[Hambach surface mine|Hambach pit mine]] is left of center.]]\n\n== Lignite mining ==\n{{main|Hambach surface mine}}\nThe area is part of the ''Rhenish Lignite Mining Area'' ({{lang-de|Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier}} ([[:de:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier|de]])), and the [[Hambach surface mine]] is the largest open pit mine in Germany, as of 2018. [[RWE AG]] has owned the land since the 1960s or earlier and has held an official permit to clear forests in the area since the 1970s. The company has repeatedly argued that Hambach Forest must be cleared to ensure future energy supply. RWE spokesperson Guido Steffen states \u201cI\u2019ve known Hambach for decades, before the mine. It was a great forest ... It\u2019s a pity it must be logged. We\u2019re not doing this because we have fun logging trees, but out of economic necessity. Germany needs energy.\u201d<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> \n\nThe usual process is to excavate the lignite/brown coal beneath it with huge excavator machines and then burn it in [[steam-electric power generation]]. The 2018 map to the right shows the extent of excavation activities until then. On this map, Hambach Forest (around abandoned old Morschenich) is not displayed at all, but under a hatching meaning \"future area of operations\".\n\n== First occupations by environmentalists (2012\u20132014) ==\nSince 2012, Hambach Forest has been a political standpoint for environmentalists who are protesting against the German energy company [[RWE AG]] because of the open-pit [[Hambach surface mine]] neighboring the site. At 33 square miles, the mine is the largest of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/><ref name=\"DW_2016\"/>\n\nAn area within the forest was occupied by those opposing the clearance for lignite extraction. They sought to close the mine and save the remaining sections of the forest which are under threat of being cut down to allow the expansion of the mine.\n\nThe first occupation lasted from April to November 2012. A second occupation started in September 2013 and lasted until March 2014, followed by a third occupation from April to October 2014.{{r|rep}}\n\n[[File:Hangingbarricade (27065382544).jpg|thumb|Barricade (September 2016)]]\n\n== Fourth occupation (2015\u20132018) ==\nThe fourth occupation period started in 2015<!-- some sources state 2014 --> and lasted until 2018. It involved a settlement with around two dozen [[tree house]]s and numerous [[road barricade]]s. The barricades were erected to prevent mining company and police vehicles from entering.<ref name=\"rep\"/>\n\n=== BUND lawsuit and court order ===\nCutting seasons last from 1 October until the end of February and usually 70-80 [[hectare]]s are cleared in each period. The tree cutting operations in the 2017/2018 cutting season ended after just two days in November 2017, after the {{ill|Higher Administrative Court North-Rhine Westphalia{{!}}Higher Administrative Court|de|Oberverwaltungsgericht f\u00fcr das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen}} in [[M\u00fcnster]] ordered a halt. According to [[BUND]], the environmental protection association that filed the corresponding lawsuit, Hambach Forest, with its [[Quercus robur|common oak]], [[hornbeam]] and [[lily of the valley]] populations, is a habitat of type 9160 of annex I of the European [[Habitats Directive]] (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992).<ref name=\"Bund_2017\"/>\nOf special interest in this lawsuit was the [[Bechstein's bat]], which is strictly protected according to annex II and annex IV of the European [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=\"BAT_2018\"/>\n\n=== Arrests of activists (spring of 2018) ===\n[[File:Gemeinsam stark,Hambacher Forst,NRW.jpg|thumb|Colony of tree houses in Hambach Forest (February 2018)]]\nOn 22 January 2018, nine Hambach Forest activists were arrested for resisting a barricade eviction.

It is planned to be cleared as part of the [[Hambach surface mine]] by owner [[RWE AG]].

The {{ill|Administrative Court Cologne{{!}}Administrative Court|de|Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln}} in [[Cologne]] denied the necessity of such a study in November 2017 because the permission for the mining operations was given in the 1970s, long before Environmental Impact Assessment studies became mandatory.<ref name=\"VGK\u00f6ln_2017\"/><ref name=\"RegArnsberg_2018\"/>\n\n[[File:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier DE.png|thumb|Lignite mining in the area, as of 2018. [[Hambach surface mine|Hambach pit mine]] is left of center.]]\n\n== Lignite mining ==\n{{main|Hambach surface mine}}\nThe area is part of the ''Rhenish Lignite Mining Area'' ({{lang-de|Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier}} ([[:de:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier|de]])), and the [[Hambach surface mine]] is the largest open pit mine in Germany, as of 2018. [[RWE AG]] has owned the land since the 1960s or earlier and has held an official permit to clear forests in the area since the 1970s. The company has repeatedly argued that Hambach Forest must be cleared to ensure future energy supply. RWE spokesperson Guido Steffen states \u201cI\u2019ve known Hambach for decades, before the mine. It was a great forest ... It\u2019s a pity it must be logged. We\u2019re not doing this because we have fun logging trees, but out of economic necessity. Germany needs energy.\u201d<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> \n\nThe usual process is to excavate the lignite/brown coal beneath it with huge excavator machines and then burn it in [[steam-electric power generation]]. The 2018 map to the right shows the extent of excavation activities until then. On this map, Hambach Forest (around abandoned old Morschenich) is not displayed at all, but under a hatching meaning \"future area of operations\".\n\n== First occupations by environmentalists (2012\u20132014) ==\nSince 2012, Hambach Forest has been a political standpoint for environmentalists who are protesting against the German energy company [[RWE AG]] because of the open-pit [[Hambach surface mine]] neighboring the site. At 33 square miles, the mine is the largest of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/><ref name=\"DW_2016\"/>\n\nAn area within the forest was occupied by those opposing the clearance for lignite extraction. They sought to close the mine and save the remaining sections of the forest which are under threat of being cut down to allow the expansion of the mine.\n\nThe first occupation lasted from April to November 2012. A second occupation started in September 2013 and lasted until March 2014, followed by a third occupation from April to October 2014.{{r|rep}}\n\n[[File:Hangingbarricade (27065382544).jpg|thumb|Barricade (September 2016)]]\n\n== Fourth occupation (2015\u20132018) ==\nThe fourth occupation period started in 2015<!-- some sources state 2014 --> and lasted until 2018. It involved a settlement with around two dozen [[tree house]]s and numerous [[road barricade]]s. The barricades were erected to prevent mining company and police vehicles from entering.<ref name=\"rep\"/>\n\n=== BUND lawsuit and court order ===\nCutting seasons last from 1 October until the end of February and usually 70-80 [[hectare]]s are cleared in each period. The tree cutting operations in the 2017/2018 cutting season ended after just two days in November 2017, after the {{ill|Higher Administrative Court North-Rhine Westphalia{{!}}Higher Administrative Court|de|Oberverwaltungsgericht f\u00fcr das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen}} in [[M\u00fcnster]] ordered a halt. According to [[BUND]], the environmental protection association that filed the corresponding lawsuit, Hambach Forest, with its [[Quercus robur|common oak]], [[hornbeam]] and [[lily of the valley]] populations, is a habitat of type 9160 of annex I of the European [[Habitats Directive]] (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992).<ref name=\"Bund_2017\"/>\nOf special interest in this lawsuit was the [[Bechstein's bat]], which is strictly protected according to annex II and annex IV of the European [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=\"BAT_2018\"/>\n\n=== Arrests of activists (spring of 2018) ===\n[[File:Gemeinsam stark,Hambacher Forst,NRW.jpg|thumb|Colony of tree houses in Hambach Forest (February 2018)]]\nOn 22 January 2018, nine Hambach Forest activists were arrested for resisting a barricade eviction.

{"title_page": "1987 Castrol 500", "text_new": "The '''1987 Castrol 500''' was a race for Touring Cars complying with Appendix C of the National Competition Rules of the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] <ref name=Program>Official Program, Castrol 500, Sandown 13 September 1987, pages 36 & 37</ref> (commonly known as [[Group A Touring Cars]]). The event was staged on 13 September 1987 over 129 laps of the 3.9&nbsp;km [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown circuit]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], a total distance of 503&nbsp;km.\n\nThe race, the 22nd [[Sandown 500]], was won by [[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel, driving a [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]].\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Nissan Skyline RS Fury (15749239780).jpg|thumb|[[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel won the race driving a [[Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]].]]\n\n===Qualifying===\nThe race saw the Australian debut of the evolution [[Ford Sierra RS500]]. Although none of the four Sierras finished the race (two in fact did not start), the new {{Convert|470|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} model proved it would be the car to beat at [[1987 James Hardie 1000]]. Andrew Miedecke in his [[Miedecke Motorsport|Oxo Supercubes]] Sierra (an [[Andy Rouse]] kit car) attained provisional pole position in qualifying with a time of 1:49.45 before his weekend ended when co-driver Don Smith rolled the car at the end of pit straight, just prior to the end of qualifying. [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] went even better in the Dulux Dozen runoff for pole with a time of 1:47.59, almost two seconds quicker than Miedecke's time earlier in the day. This time would remain the fastest ever Group A touring car time recorded on the 3.9&nbsp;km long international circuit.\n\n[[Peter Brock]] attracted pre-race criticism for his decision to have [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television commentator [[Neil Crompton]] as the lead driver of the [[Holden Dealer Team#Group A|Mobil 1]] team's [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A|Holden Commodore]] with accusations of it being nothing more than a [[Public relations|PR]] exercise after the bad press the team had received in 1987 in the wake of Brock's split with [[Holden]]. However, despite his relative lack of experience in touring cars, Crompton put in a credible performance and ended up in 11th place after the Dulux Dozen. With new [[Bridgestone]] tyres and an adjustable rear end developed by the team that allowed negative camber of the rear tyres transforming the handling of the Commodore, plus some extra engine development up to and following the [[Spa 24 Hours]] bringing power up to a respectable {{Convert|420|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, Brock himself qualified fifth, only a couple of tenths behind [[Allan Grice]]'s Les Small prepared [[Roadways Racing|Roadways]] VL Commodore and some 1.5 seconds faster than [[Larry Perkins]] in the older model [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A|VK]]. Both Grice and Perkins were running engines with approximately {{Convert|40|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} more than the HDT cars.\n\n===Race===\nThe 1987 Castrol 500 was won by the [[Gibson Motor Sport|Peter Jackson Nissan Racing]] [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Skyline DR30 RS]] of [[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel. The win continued the Nissan team's winning streak at Sandown in 1986 and 1987 with the Skyline, having won the ATCC rounds at the circuit in both years as well as Fury and [[Glenn Seton]] having won the [[1986 Castrol 500]]. They won by a lap from the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A|Holden VK Commodore]] of [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Denny Hulme]] with the New Zealand Nissan Skyline of Kent Baigent and Graeme Bowkett a further lap back in third place. [[New Zealanders|Kiwi]]s Kaigent and Bowkett continued to impress with their speed in the privateer Skyline, never falling out of the top five during the race except during pit stops. The NZ Skyline was engineered by Jim and Ross Stone who would later go on to work with both [[Andrew Miedecke]] and Dick Johnson Sierra's over the next few seasons before forming their own team [[Stone Brothers Racing]]. The car also featured a lot of technical input from the Peter Jackson team.\n\nThe Ford Sierra of pole sitter Dick Johnson suffered an engine failure in the race morning warmup which forced him and [[Gregg Hansford]] to move to the team's car. After starting from 14th on the grid, Johnson showed the speed of the new Sierra by storming to the front after just 7 laps, leaving the BMW's, Commodores and turbo Nissans in his wake on Sandown's long front and back straights. Johnson would go on to set a Group A lap record of 1:50.28 before the #18 car was retired with engine failure on lap 86.\n\nThe [[JPS Team BMW]] [[E30 M3|M3]] of [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Tony Longhurst]] held second place late in the race and Richards was contesting the lead with Fury on the now damp track due to light rain until the [[BMW S14|2.3 L engine]] lost oil pressure on lap 118. Just five laps earlier, the [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A|Holden VL Commodore]] of [[Peter Brock]] had been holding a strong third place comfortably in front of Perkins until his front brakes suddenly gave out at the end of pit straight. Brock slid sideways into the sandtrap and was lucky not to roll the Commodore after the driver's side wheels dug into the sand.<ref name=Naismith>{{cite book|last1=Naismith|first1=Barry|title=Bathurst 1987/88|date=December 1987|publisher=Garry Sparke & Associates|location=Glen Waverley, Victoria|isbn=0 908 081 359|pages=60\u201371 The Castrol 500: The Match Race|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThe Up to 2000cc class was won by the Peter Jackson Nissan [[Nissan Gazelle|Gazelle]] of young gun [[Mark Skaife]] and part-time [[Group B Sports Sedans|sports sedan]] racer Grant Jarrett from the [[Toyota Team Australia]] [[Toyota Corolla (E90)|Corolla]] of Mike Quinn and [[John Faulkner (racing driver)|John Faulkner]] and the [[Toyota AE86|Toyota Sprinter]] of Sydney veterans [[Bob Holden (racing driver)|Bob Holden]] and Garry Willmington.\n\n===Television coverage===\nAustralian broadcasters Channel Seven covered both the Saturday shootout and the entire race.

The event was staged on 13 September 1987 over 129 laps of the 3.9&nbsp;km [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown circuit]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], a total distance of 503&nbsp;km.\n\nThe race, the 22nd [[Sandown 500]], was won by [[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel, driving a [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]].\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Nissan Skyline RS Fury (15749239780).jpg|thumb|[[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel won the race driving a [[Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]].]]\n\n===Qualifying===\nThe race saw the Australian debut of the evolution [[Ford Sierra RS500]]. Although none of the four Sierras finished the race (two in fact did not start), the new {{Convert|470|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} model proved it would be the car to beat at [[1987 James Hardie 1000]]. Andrew Miedecke in his [[Miedecke Motorsport|Oxo Supercubes]] Sierra (an [[Andy Rouse]] kit car) attained provisional pole position in qualifying with a time of 1:49.45 before his weekend ended when co-driver Don Smith rolled the car at the end of pit straight, just prior to the end of qualifying. [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] went even better in the Dulux Dozen runoff for pole with a time of 1:47.59, almost two seconds quicker than Miedecke's time earlier in the day. This time would remain the fastest ever Group A touring car time recorded on the 3.9&nbsp;km long international circuit.\n\n[[Peter Brock]] attracted pre-race criticism for his decision to have [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television commentator [[Neil Crompton]] as the lead driver of the [[Holden Dealer Team#Group A|Mobil 1]] teams second [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A|Holden Commodore]] with accusations of it being nothing more than a [[Public relations|PR]] exercise after the bad press the team had received in 1987 in the wake of Brock's split with [[Holden]]. However, despite his relative lack of experience in touring cars, Crompton put in a credible performance and ended up in 11th place after the Dulux Dozen. With new [[Bridgestone]] tyres and an adjustable rear end developed by the team that allowed negative camber of the rear tyres transforming the handling of the Commodore, plus some extra engine development up to and following the [[Spa 24 Hours]] bringing power up to a respectable {{Convert|420|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, Brock himself qualified fifth, only a couple of tenths behind [[Allan Grice]]'s Les Small prepared [[Roadways Racing|Roadways]] VL Commodore and some 1.5 seconds faster than [[Larry Perkins]] in the older model [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A|VK]]. Both Grice and Perkins were running engines with approximately {{Convert|40|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} more than the HDT cars.\n\n===Race===\nThe 1987 Castrol 500 was won by the [[Gibson Motor Sport|Peter Jackson Nissan Racing]] [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Skyline DR30 RS]] of [[George Fury]] and Terry Shiel. The win continued the Nissan team's winning streak at Sandown in 1986 and 1987 with the Skyline, having won the ATCC rounds at the circuit in both years as well as Fury and [[Glenn Seton]] having won the [[1986 Castrol 500]]. They won by a lap from the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A|Holden VK Commodore]] of [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Denny Hulme]] with the New Zealand Nissan Skyline of Kent Baigent and Graeme Bowkett a further lap back in third place. [[New Zealanders|Kiwi]]s Kaigent and Bowkett continued to impress with their speed in the privateer Skyline, never falling out of the top five during the race except during pit stops. The NZ Skyline was engineered by Jim and Ross Stone who would later go on to work with both [[Andrew Miedecke]] and Dick Johnson Sierra's over the next few seasons before forming their own team [[Stone Brothers Racing]]. The car also featured a lot of technical input from the Peter Jackson team.\n\nThe Ford Sierra of pole sitter Dick Johnson suffered an engine failure in the race morning warmup which forced him and [[Gregg Hansford]] to move to the teams second car. After starting from 14th on the grid, Johnson showed the speed of the new Sierra by storming to the front after just 7 laps, leaving the BMW's, Commodores and turbo Nissans in his wake on Sandown's long front and back straights. Johnson would go on to set a Group A lap record of 1:50.28 before the #18 car was retired with engine failure on lap 86.\n\nThe [[JPS Team BMW]] [[E30 M3|M3]] of [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Tony Longhurst]] held second place late in the race and Richards was contesting the lead with Fury on the now damp track due to light rain until the [[BMW S14|2.3 L engine]] lost oil pressure on lap 118. Just five laps earlier, the [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A|Holden VL Commodore]] of [[Peter Brock]] had been holding a strong third place comfortably in front of Perkins until his front brakes suddenly gave out at the end of pit straight. Brock slid sideways into the sandtrap and was lucky not to roll the Commodore after the driver's side wheels dug into the sand.<ref name=Naismith>{{cite book|last1=Naismith|first1=Barry|title=Bathurst 1987/88|date=December 1987|publisher=Garry Sparke & Associates|location=Glen Waverley, Victoria|isbn=0 908 081 359|pages=60\u201371 The Castrol 500: The Match Race|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThe Up to 2000cc class was won by the Peter Jackson Nissan [[Nissan Gazelle|Gazelle]] of young gun [[Mark Skaife]] and part-time [[Group B Sports Sedans|sports sedan]] racer Grant Jarrett from the [[Toyota Team Australia]] [[Toyota Corolla (E90)|Corolla]] of Mike Quinn and [[John Faulkner (racing driver)|John Faulkner]] and the [[Toyota AE86|Toyota Sprinter]] of Sydney veterans [[Bob Holden (racing driver)|Bob Holden]] and Garry Willmington.\n\n===Television coverage===\nAustralian broadcasters Channel Seven covered both the Saturday shootout and the entire race.
