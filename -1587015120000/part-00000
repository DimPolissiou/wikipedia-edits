The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 \u2014 the amount he owed his landlord \u2014 in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics/appearance would not be a good factor in how she wants her child to be/look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through \"ten rules\" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"[[sin|bad things]]\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Landlord\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andre]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* [[Donna Sorbello]] as Anna's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]\u2019s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest.

The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 \u2014 the amount he owed his landlord \u2014 in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics/appearance would not be a good factor in how she wants her child to be/look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through \"ten rules\" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"[[sin|bad things]]\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Landlor\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andre]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* [[Donna Sorbello]] as Anna's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]\u2019s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest.

The United Nations was FDR's highest postwar priority. He insisted on full coordination with the Republican leadership. He made sure that leading Republicans were on board, especially Senators [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan,<ref>James A. Gazell, \"Arthur H.

Those hopes have obviously not fully come to pass.  From about 1947 until 1991 the division of the world into hostile camps during the [[Cold War]] made agreement on [[peacekeeping]] matters extremely difficult. Following the end of the Cold War, renewed calls arose for the UN to become the agency for achieving world peace and co-operation, as several dozen active military conflicts continued to rage across the globe. The breakup of the Soviet Union has also left the [[United States]] in a unique position of global dominance, creating a variety of new problems for the UN (See the [[United States and the United Nations]]).\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|alt=Two skyscraper buildings on the bank of a river.|[[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in [[City of New York|New York City]]]][[File:Vereinte Nationen in Wien.jpg|alt=Huge complex of skyscrapers and other large buildings interlaced with trees and gardens.

Produced by [[ABC Studios]], the series was created by [[Joshua Safran]], who also served as the [[showrunner]]. [[Mark Gordon]], Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Safran are its executive producers. [[Michael Seitzman]] replaced Safran as the new showrunner and an executive producer in its third season, with Safran remaining as an executive producer. \n\n[[Priyanka Chopra]] stars as [[Alex Parrish]], who joins the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after graduating from the [[FBI Academy]] and becomes a prime suspect in a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]]. ''Quantico'' initially had two timelines: the present, when Parrish flees from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, with her and her fellow recruits training at the academy, during which details of their individual lives are learned. The series switched to a single timeline from the middle of the second season onward.\n\nIn addition to Chopra, the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series, the original cast\u2014which changed significantly as the series progressed\u2014included [[Jake McLaughlin]], [[Yasmine Al Massri]], [[Johanna Braddy]], [[Tate Ellington]], and [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as her fellow recruits, with [[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as their trainers at the FBI Academy in [[Quantico, Virginia]]. The series' first season was produced primarily in [[Montreal]], with [[downtown Montreal]] and [[Sherbrooke]], Canada standing in for [[New York City]] and [[Quantico, Virginia]] in the United States. Production moved to New York during the second season, with a few episodes being shot in Italy and Ireland for its third season.\n\n''Quantico'' received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Chopra's performance and the diversity of the cast. The \"confusing dual timelines\" were criticized by some. The series was nominated for four [[People's Choice Awards]], including Favorite Network TV Drama, with Chopra winning two: Favorite Actress in a New TV Series in [[42nd People's Choice Awards|2016]]\u2014making her the first South Asian to win a People's Choice Award\u2014and Favorite Dramatic TV Actress in [[43rd People's Choice Awards|2017]]. ABC canceled the series in May 2018, and it ended after three seasons.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{see also|List of Quantico episodes}}\nAlex Parrish, a former [[FBI]] recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]] and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the Bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The present-day timeline focuses on Parrish's strained relationship with her friends while she is on the run and attempting to prove her innocence, even as additional violent attacks take place. \n\nIn the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI. In flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] recruit at [[Camp Peary|The Farm]] to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the present timeline, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in [[New York City]] is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President [[List of Quantico characters#Claire Hass|Claire Haas]] and CIA director [[List of Quantico characters#Matthew Keyes|Matthew Keyes]] form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by [[List of Quantico characters#Clay Haas|Clay Haas]]) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.\n\nThe third season is set three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention. After living anonymously in Italy, Parrish is forced to return to the United States after [[List of Quantico characters#Ryan Booth|Ryan Booth]] shares information to her about [[List of Quantico characters#Shelby Wyatt|Shelby Wyatt]]'s kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Wyatt, Booth and Parrish recruit [[List of Quantico characters#Owen Hall|Owen Hall]] and [[List of Quantico characters#Harry Doyle|Harry Doyle]] to help them with their mission. Hall invites [[List of Quantico characters#Jocelyn Turner|Jocelyn Turner]] to the team as the former FBI agent has intelligence about the arms dealer, due in part to their past encounter. Owing to the extreme circumstances of the covert operation, the team must retrieve Wyatt at all costs, before time runs out.\n{{:List of Quantico episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Quantico characters}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as [[Alex Parrish]], a promising FBI agent who becomes a prime suspect in the Grand Central Terminal bombing case<ref name=\"alex\" /> \n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as Liam O'Connor, a seasoned FBI agent who was demoted to work at the FBI academy as a teacher<ref name=\"liam\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Jake McLaughlin]] as Ryan Booth, an undercover FBI agent tasked with tracking Alex<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> \n* [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Miranda Shaw, former assistant director of the FBI Academy at Quantico<ref name=\"miranda\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as Caleb Haas, a former FBI agent<ref name=\"caleb\" /> (season 1, guest season 2)\n* [[Yasmine Al Massri]] as Nimah and Raina Amin, twins recruited by Miranda for the FBI<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Johanna Braddy]] as Shelby Wyatt, Alex's best friend and fellow FBI agent<ref name=\"castroundup\" />\n* [[Tate Ellington]] as Simon Asher, Alex's fellow FBI trainee<ref name=\"simon\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Anabelle Acosta]] as Natalie Vasquez, an FBI trainee and Alex's former rival at the academy<ref name=\"natalie\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Harry Doyle, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"harry\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Pearl Thusi]] as Dayana Mampasi, an attorney and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"dayana\" /> (season 2)\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Owen Hall, a former CIA lead instructor at The Farm and current Deputy Director of the FBI<ref name=\"owen\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Jocelyn Turner, an ex-FBI agent and undercover expert whose career was derailed after she was rendered deaf from a bombing<ref name=\"jocelynturner\" /> (season 3)\n* [[Alan Powell (actor)|Alan Powell]] as Mike McQuigg, an overly assertive and adept FBI operative with several years of undercover experience<ref name=\"mikemcquigg\" /> (season 3)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=To me this series is like those high octane summer blockbuster movies we used to have in the '80s and '90s with all of the action and stuff, but there's also like this Trojan horse quality to it as well in that within all the action you get to talk about domestic terrorism, religion, politics, and belief systems.

Produced by [[ABC Studios]], the series was created by [[Joshua Safran]], who also served as the [[showrunner]]. [[Mark Gordon]], Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Safran are its executive producers. [[Michael Seitzman]] replaced Safran as the new showrunner and an executive producer in its third season, with Safran remaining as an executive producer. \n\n[[Priyanka Chopra]] stars as [[Alex Parrish]], who joins the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after graduating from the [[FBI Academy]] and becomes a prime suspect in a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]]. ''Quantico'' initially had two timelines: the present, when Parrish flees from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, with her and her fellow recruits training at the academy, during which details of their individual lives are learned. The series switched to a single timeline from the middle of the second season onward.\n\nIn addition to Chopra, the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series, the original cast\u2014which changed significantly as the series progressed\u2014included [[Jake McLaughlin]], [[Yasmine Al Massri]], [[Johanna Braddy]], [[Tate Ellington]], and [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as her fellow recruits, with [[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as their trainers at the FBI Academy in [[Quantico, Virginia]]. The series' first season was produced primarily in [[Montreal]], with [[downtown Montreal]] and [[Sherbrooke]], Canada standing in for [[New York City]] and [[Quantico, Virginia]] in the United States. Production moved to New York during the second season, with a few episodes being shot in Italy and Ireland for its third season.\n\n''Quantico'' received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Chopra's performance and the diversity of the cast. The \"confusing dual timelines\" were criticized by some. The series was nominated for four [[People's Choice Awards]], including Favorite Network TV Drama, with Chopra winning two: Favorite Actress in a New TV Series in [[42nd People's Choice Awards|2016]]\u2014making her the first South Asian to win a People's Choice Award\u2014and Favorite Dramatic TV Actress in [[43rd People's Choice Awards|2017]]. ABC canceled the series in May 2018, and it ended after three seasons.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{see also|List of Quantico episodes}}\nAlex Parrish, a former [[FBI]] recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]] and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the Bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The present-day timeline focuses on Parrish's strained relationship with her friends while she is on the run and attempting to prove her innocence, even as additional violent attacks take place. \n\nIn the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI. In flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] recruit at [[Camp Peary|The Farm]] to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the present timeline, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in [[New York City]] is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President [[List of Quantico characters#Claire Hass|Claire Haas]] and CIA director [[List of Quantico characters#Matthew Keyes|Matthew Keyes]] form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by [[List of Quantico characters#Clay Haas|Clay Haas]]) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.\n\nThe third season is set three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention. After living anonymously in Italy, Parrish is forced to return to the United States after [[List of Quantico characters#Ryan Booth|Ryan Booth]] shares information to her about [[List of Quantico characters#Shelby Wyatt|Shelby Wyatt]]'s kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Wyatt, Booth and Parrish recruit [[List of Quantico characters#Owen Hall|Owen Hall]] and [[List of Quantico characters#Harry Doyle|Harry Doyle]] to help them with their mission. Hall invites [[List of Quantico characters#Jocelyn Turner|Jocelyn Turner]] to the team as the former FBI agent has intelligence about the arms dealer, due in part to their past encounter. Owing to the extreme circumstances of the covert operation, the team must retrieve Wyatt at all costs, before time runs out.\n{{:List of Quantico episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Quantico characters}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as [[Alex Parrish]], a promising FBI agent who becomes a prime suspect in the Grand Central Terminal bombing case<ref name=\"alex\" /> \n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as Liam O'Connor, a seasoned FBI agent who was demoted to work at the FBI academy as a teacher<ref name=\"liam\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Jake McLaughlin]] as Ryan Booth, an undercover FBI agent tasked with tracking Alex<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> \n* [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Miranda Shaw, former assistant director of the FBI Academy at Quantico<ref name=\"miranda\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as Caleb Haas, a former FBI agent<ref name=\"caleb\" /> (season 1, guest season 2)\n* [[Yasmine Al Massri]] as Nimah and Raina Amin, twins recruited by Miranda for the FBI<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Johanna Braddy]] as Shelby Wyatt, Alex's best friend and fellow FBI agent<ref name=\"castroundup\" />\n* [[Tate Ellington]] as Simon Asher, Alex's fellow FBI trainee<ref name=\"simon\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Anabelle Acosta]] as Natalie Vasquez, an FBI trainee and Alex's former rival at the academy<ref name=\"natalie\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Harry Doyle, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"harry\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Pearl Thusi]] as Dayana Mampasi, an attorney and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"dayana\" /> (season 2)\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Owen Hall, a former CIA lead instructor at The Farm and current Deputy Director of the FBI<ref name=\"owen\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Jocelyn Turner, an ex-FBI agent and undercover expert whose career was derailed after she was rendered deaf from a bombing<ref name=\"jocelynturner\" /> (season 3)\n* [[Alan Powell (actor)|Alan Powell]] as Mike McQuigg, an overly assertive and adept FBI operative with several years of undercover experience<ref name=\"mikemcquigg\" /> (season 3)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=To me this series is like those high octane summer blockbuster movies we used to have in the '80s and '90s with all of the action and stuff, but there's also like this Trojan horse quality to it as well in that within all the action you get to talk about domestic terrorism, religion, politics, and belief systems.

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New York Times'', and ''The Observer'' reported that the data-set had included information on 50 million Facebook users.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-exposed-87-million-users-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Facebook Exposed 87 Million Users to Cambridge Analytica|work=Wired|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT original4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Matthew|last2=Confessore|first2=Nicholas|date=March 17, 2018|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317131953/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|archive-date=March 17, 2018|last3=Cadwalladr|first3=Carole|df=}}</ref> While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected 30 million Facebook user profiles,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-send-cambridge-analytica-data-use-notices-monday-n863811|title=Facebook to send Cambridge Analytica data-use notices to 87 million users today|date=April 9, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=April 9, 2018|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over 87 million users,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245049/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-affected-87-million-people-facebook-says/|title=The Cambridge Analytica scandal affected 87 million people, Facebook says|last1=Kozlowska|first1=Hanna|date=April 4, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> with 70.6 million of those people from the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245355/outside-us-philippines-saw-most-facebook-user-data-go-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Outside US, Philippines saw most Facebook user data go to Cambridge Analytica|last1=Horwitz|first1=Josh|date=April 5, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> Within the United States, Facebook estimated that [[California]] was the most affected U.S. state, with 6.7 million impacted users, followed by [[Texas]], with 5.6 million, and [[Florida]], with 4.3 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nieva|first=Richard|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/most-facebook-users-hit-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-are-californians/|title=Most Facebook users hit by Cambridge Analytica scandal are Californians|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=June 13, 2018|publisher=CNET}}</ref> Data was collected on 87 million users while only 270,000 people downloaded the app.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Information ====\nFacebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected, saying the information likely included one's \"public profile, page likes, birthday and current city\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Martin|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/how-to-find-out-if-your-facebook-data-was-shared-with-cambridge-analytica-using-new-tool-launched-by-a3810551.html|title=Find out if your Facebook data was shared with Cambridge Analytica|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Some of the app's users gave the app permission to access their News Feed, timeline, and messages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-private-facebook-messages/|title=Cambridge Analytica Could Also Access Private Facebook Messages|work=Wired|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create [[Psychographics|psychographic]] profiles of the subjects of the data.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> The data also included the locations of each person.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> For a given political campaign, the data was detailed enough to create a profile which suggested what kind of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" />\n\n==Use of the data==\nPolitical events for which politicians paid Cambridge Analytica to use information from the data breach include the following:\n\n==== '''Ted Cruz Campaign''' ====\nIn 2016, Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential Campaign.

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New York Times'', and ''The Observer'' reported that the data-set had included information on 50 million Facebook users.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-exposed-87-million-users-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Facebook Exposed 87 Million Users to Cambridge Analytica|work=Wired|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT original4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Matthew|last2=Confessore|first2=Nicholas|date=March 17, 2018|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317131953/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|archive-date=March 17, 2018|last3=Cadwalladr|first3=Carole|df=}}</ref> While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected 30 million Facebook user profiles,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-send-cambridge-analytica-data-use-notices-monday-n863811|title=Facebook to send Cambridge Analytica data-use notices to 87 million users today|date=April 9, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=April 9, 2018|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over 87 million users,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245049/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-affected-87-million-people-facebook-says/|title=The Cambridge Analytica scandal affected 87 million people, Facebook says|last1=Kozlowska|first1=Hanna|date=April 4, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> with 70.6 million of those people from the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245355/outside-us-philippines-saw-most-facebook-user-data-go-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Outside US, Philippines saw most Facebook user data go to Cambridge Analytica|last1=Horwitz|first1=Josh|date=April 5, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> Within the United States, Facebook estimated that [[California]] was the most affected U.S. state, with 6.7 million impacted users, followed by [[Texas]], with 5.6 million, and [[Florida]], with 4.3 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nieva|first=Richard|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/most-facebook-users-hit-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-are-californians/|title=Most Facebook users hit by Cambridge Analytica scandal are Californians|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=June 13, 2018|publisher=CNET}}</ref> Data was collected on 87 million users while only 270,000 people downloaded the app.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Information ====\nFacebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected, saying the information likely included one's \"public profile, page likes, birthday and current city\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Martin|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/how-to-find-out-if-your-facebook-data-was-shared-with-cambridge-analytica-using-new-tool-launched-by-a3810551.html|title=Find out if your Facebook data was shared with Cambridge Analytica|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Some of the app's users gave the app permission to access their News Feed, timeline, and messages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-private-facebook-messages/|title=Cambridge Analytica Could Also Access Private Facebook Messages|work=Wired|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create [[Psychographics|psychographic]] profiles of the subjects of the data.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> The data also included the locations of each person.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> For a given political campaign, the data was detailed enough to create a profile which suggested what kind of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" />\n\n==Use of the data==\nPolitical events for which politicians paid Cambridge Analytica to use information from the data breach include the following:\n\n==== '''Ted Cruz Campaign''' ====\nIn 2016, Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential Campaign.

reacted to the data privacy breach by initiating the campaign #DeleteFacebook with the aim of starting a movement to boycott Facebook. The hashtag was used almost 90,000 on social media platforms such Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. 93% of the mentions of the hashtag actually appeared on Twitter, making it the main social media platform used to share the hashtag.<ref>Data source: Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2018-01-01%202020-01-01&geo=US&q=%23deletefacebook)</ref> However, a survey by investment firm Raymond James found that although approximately 84% of Facebook users were concerned about how the app used their data, about 48% of those surveyed claimed they wouldn\u2019t actually cut back on their usage of the social media network.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/03/28/people-really-deleting-their-facebook-accounts-its-complicated/464109002/|title=Delete Facebook?

Further, he claimed that the correlation between user \u201clikes\u201d and personality traits were weak and thus the psychological profiling of users were also weak.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== Mark Jamison ====\nMark Jamison, the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, testified before Congress on May 6, 2018 as an expert. Jamison reiterated that it was not unusual for presidential campaigns to use data like Facebook\u2019s data to profile voters; Presidents Barack Obama and [[George W. Bush]] also used models to micro-target voters. Jamison criticized Facebook for not being \u201cclear and candid with its users\u201d because the users were not aware of the extent that their data would be used. Jamison finished his testimony by saying that if the federal government were to regulate voter targeting to happen on sites like Facebook, it would harm the users of those sites because it would be too restrictive of those sites and would make things worse for regulators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/05-16-18%20Jamison%20Testimony.pdf|title=Mark Jamison's Written Testimony to the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Christopher Wylie ====\nOn May 16, 2018, Christopher Wylie, who is considered the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d on Cambridge Analytica and also served as Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Director of Research in 2013 and 2014, also testified to Congress. He was considered a witness to both British and American authorities, and he claims he decided to whistle-blow to \u201cprotect democratic institutions from rogue actors and hostile foreign interference, as well as ensure the safety of Americans online.\u201d He claimed that at Cambridge Analytica \u201canything goes\u201d and that Cambridge Analytica was \u201ca corrupting force in the world.\u201d He detailed to Congress how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook\u2019s data to categorize people into groups based on political ideology. He also claimed that Eitan Hersh contradicted \u201ccopious amounts of peer-reviewed literature in top scientific journals, including the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]], [[Psychological Science]], and Journal of Personality and Individual Differences\u201d by saying that Facebook\u2019s categorizing of people were weak.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/05-16-18%20Wylie%20Testimony.pdf|title=Christopher Wylie's Written Testimony to the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wylie also testified about Russian contact with Cambridge Analytica and the campaign, voter disengagement, and his thoughts on Facebook\u2019s response.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\n==== Mark Zuckerberg ====\nDuring his testimony before Congress on April 10, 2018, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] said it was his personal mistake that he did not do enough to prevent Facebook from being used for harm. \u201cThat goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech.\u201d During the testimony, Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for the breach of private data: \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.

The app was then able to retrieve Facebook information, including that of the users' friends, and this was obtained by Kogan. It was not until 2015 that Zuckerberg learned that these users' information was shared by Kogan with [[Cambridge Analytica]]. Cambridge Analytica was subsequently asked to remove all the data. It was later discovered by ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[The New York Times]] and [[Channel 4]] that the data had in fact not been deleted.<ref name=\":023\">{{Cite web|url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20180411/108090/HHRG-115-IF00-Wstate-ZuckerbergM-20180411.pdf|title=Mark Zuckerberg's Written Testimony to the House of Representatives|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Successors==\n\nAccording to the [[Associated Press]], a company run by former officials at Cambridge Analytica, [[Data Propria]], has been working for President [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020|Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election effort]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/96928216bdc341ada659447973a688e4/AP:-Trump-2020-working-with-ex-Cambridge-Analytica-staffers|title=AP: Trump 2020 working with ex-Cambridge Analytica staffers|author=Jeff Horwitz|date=June 15, 2018|work=Associated Press|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n* [[AggregateIQ]]\n* [[BeLeave]]\n* ''[[The Great Hack]]'', 2019 documentary film\n* [[Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum]]\n* [[Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2019)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c81zyn0888lt/facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal BBC Coverage]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files The Guardian Coverage]\n*[https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy/transcript Carole Cadwalladr @TED2019: Facebook's role in Brexit \u2014 and the threat to democracy]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline New York Times Coverage]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election The Guardian Article; Revealed]\n\n{{Facebook navbox}}\n{{Corporate scandals}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal}}\n[[Category:Data breaches]]\n[[Category:Big data]]\n[[Category:Cambridge Analytica]]\n[[Category:Facebook criticisms and controversies]]\n[[Category:2018 scandals]]\n[[Category:Political scandals in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Political scandals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Corporate scandals]]\n", "name_user": "2402:d000:a000:faae:4f6:e56d:5301:6384", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDonald Trump Campaign)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"}
