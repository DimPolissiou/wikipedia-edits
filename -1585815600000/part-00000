{"title_page": "Key management", "text_new": "{{short description|Management of cryptographic keys}}\n{{other uses}}\n'''Key management''' refers to management  of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] in a [[cryptosystem]]. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, [[crypto-shredding]] (destruction) and replacement of keys. It includes [[cryptographic protocol]] design, [[Key server (cryptographic)|key server]]s, user procedures, and other relevant protocols.<ref name=\"Turner-What-is-key-management\">{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What Is Key Management? A CISO Perspective|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-key-management-a-ciso-perspective|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nKey management concerns keys at the user level, either between users or systems. This is in contrast to [[key scheduling]], which typically refers to the internal handling of keys within the operation of a cipher.\n\nSuccessful key management is critical to the security of a cryptosystem. It is the more challenging side of [[cryptography]] in a sense that it involves aspects of social engineering such as system policy, user training, organizational and departmental interactions, and coordination between all of these elements, in contrast to pure mathematical practices that can be automated.\n\n==Types of keys==\n{{main|Cryptographic key types}}\nCryptographic systems may use different types of keys, with some systems using more than one. These may include symmetric keys or asymmetric keys. In a [[symmetric key algorithm]] the keys involved are identical for both encrypting and decrypting a message. Keys must be chosen carefully, and distributed and stored securely. Asymmetric keys, also known as [[Public-key cryptography|public keys]], in contrast are two distinct keys that are mathematically linked. They are typically used together to communicate. Public key infrastructure (PKI), the implementation of public key cryptography,  requires an organization to establish an infrastructure to create and manage public and private key pairs along with digital certificates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Randall|last2=Panko|first2=Ray|title=Corporate Computer Security|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River New Jersey|page=278|edition=Fourth}}</ref>\n\n==Inventory==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe starting point in any certificate and private key management strategy is to create a comprehensive inventory of all certificates, their locations and responsible parties. This is not a trivial matter because certificates from a variety of sources are deployed in a variety of locations by different individuals and teams - it's simply not possible to rely on a list from a single [[certificate authority]]. Certificates that are not renewed and replaced before they expire can cause serious downtime and outages. Some other considerations:\n*Regulations and requirements, like PCI-DSS, demand stringent security and management of cryptographic keys and auditors are increasingly reviewing the management controls and processes in use.\n*Private keys used with certificates must be kept secure or unauthorised individuals can intercept confidential communications or gain unauthorised access to critical systems. Failure to ensure proper segregation of duties means that admins who generate the encryption keys can use them to access sensitive, regulated data.\n*If a certificate authority is compromised or an encryption algorithm is broken, organizations must be prepared to replace all of their certificates and keys in a matter of hours.\n\n==Management steps==\nOnce keys are inventoried, key management typically consists of three steps: exchange, storage and use.\n\n===Key exchange===\n{{Main|Key exchange}}\nPrior to any secured communication, users must set up the details of the cryptography. In some instances this may require exchanging identical keys (in the case of a symmetric key system). In others it may require possessing the other party's public key. While public keys can be openly exchanged (their corresponding private key is kept secret), symmetric keys must be exchanged over a secure communication channel. Formerly, exchange of such a key was extremely troublesome, and was greatly eased by access to secure channels such as a [[diplomatic bag]]. [[Clear text]] exchange of symmetric keys would enable any interceptor to immediately learn the key, and any encrypted data.\n\nThe advance of public key cryptography in the 1970s has made the exchange of keys less troublesome. Since the [[Diffie-Hellman]] key exchange protocol was published in 1975, it has become possible to exchange a key over an insecure communications channel, which has substantially reduced the risk of key disclosure during distribution. It is possible, using something akin to a [[book code]], to include key indicators as clear text attached to an encrypted message. The encryption technique used by [[Richard Sorge]]'s code clerk was of this type, referring to a page in a statistical manual, though it was in fact a code. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] symmetric encryption key was a mixed type early in its use; the key was a combination of secretly distributed key schedules and a user-chosen session key component for each message.\n\nIn more modern systems, such as [[OpenPGP]] compatible systems, a session key for the asymmetric key algorithm is distributed encrypted by an [[asymmetric key algorithm]]. This approach avoids even the necessity for using a key exchange protocol like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nAnother method of key exchange involves encapsulating one key within another. Typically a master key is generated and exchanged using some secure method. This method is usually cumbersome or expensive (breaking a master key into multiple parts and sending each with a trusted courier for example) and not suitable for use on a larger scale. Once the master key has been securely exchanged, it can then be used to securely exchange subsequent keys with ease. This technique is usually termed [[key wrap]]. A common technique uses [[block cipher]]s and cryptographic [[hash function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pressestelle Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum - Online-Redaktion |url=https://www.administrativeinfo.com/2019/05/key-management-skills.html |title=management skills - Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum |language=de |publisher=administrative info|date= April 2020 |accessdate=2013-08-06 }}{{link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nA related method is to exchange a master key (sometimes termed a root key) and derive subsidiary keys as needed from that key and some other data (often referred to as diversification data). The most common use for this method is probably in [[smartcard]]-based cryptosystems, such as those found in banking cards. The bank or credit network embeds its secret key into the card's secure key storage during card production at a secured production facility. Then at the [[point of sale]] the card and card reader are both able to derive a common set of session keys based on the shared secret key and card-specific data (such as the card serial number). This method can also be used when keys must be related to each other (i.e., departmental keys are tied to divisional keys, and individual keys tied to departmental keys). However, tying keys to each other in this way increases the damage which may result from a security breach as attackers will learn something about more than one key. This reduces entropy, with regard to an attacker, for each key involved.\n\n===Key storage===\nHowever distributed, keys must be stored securely to maintain communications security. Security is a big concern<ref name=\"Crain's New York\">{{cite web|title=An ancient technology gets a key makeover|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131120/TECHNOLOGY/131129993/an-ancient-technology-gets-a-key-makeover|website=Crain's New York Business|publisher=Crain's New York|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> and hence there are various techniques in use to do so. Likely the most common is that an encryption application manages keys for the user and depends on an access password to control use of the key. Likewise, in the case of smartphone keyless access platforms, they keep all identifying door information off mobile phones and servers and encrypt all data, where just like low-tech keys, users give codes only to those they trust.<ref name=\"Crain's New York\"/>\n\n===Key use===\nThe major issue is length of time a key is to be used, and therefore frequency of replacement. Because it increases any attacker's required effort, keys should be frequently changed. This also limits loss of information, as the number of stored encrypted messages which will become readable when a key is found will decrease as the frequency of key change increases. Historically, symmetric keys have been used for long periods in situations in which key exchange was very difficult or only possible intermittently. Ideally, the symmetric key should change with each message or interaction, so that only that message will become readable if the key is learned (''e.g.'', stolen, cryptanalyzed, or social engineered).\n\n==Challenges==\nSeveral challenges IT organizations face when trying to control and manage their encryption keys are:\n# Scalability: Managing a large number of encryption keys.\n# Security: Vulnerability of keys from outside hackers, malicious insiders.\n# Availability: Ensuring data accessibility for authorized users.\n# Heterogeneity: Supporting multiple databases, applications and standards.\n# Governance: Defining policy-driven access control and protection for data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Tina-stewart/security-policy-and-enterprise-key-management-from-vormetric |title=Security Policy and Key Management: Centrally Manage Encryption Key |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref> Governance includes compliance with [[Information privacy|data protection]] requirements.\n\n==Compliance==\nKey management compliance refers to the oversight, assurance and capability of being able to demonstrate that keys are securely managed. This includes the following individual compliance domains:\n\n* ''Physical security'' \u2013 the most visible form of compliance, which may include locked doors to secure system equipment and surveillance cameras. These safeguards can prevent unauthorized access to printed copies of key material and computer systems that run key management software.\n* ''Logical security'' \u2013 protects the organization against the theft or unauthorized access of information. This is where the use of cryptographic keys comes in by encrypting data, which is then rendered useless to those who do not have the key to decrypt it.\n* ''Personnel security'' \u2013 this involves assigning specific roles or privileges to personnel to access information on a strict need-to-know basis. Background checks should be performed on new employees along with periodic role changes to ensure security.<ref name=\"Turner-What-is-key-management\" /><ref name=\"Reinholm-KeyManagementCompliance\">{{cite web|last1=Reinholm|first1=James H.|title=Simplifying the Complex Process of Auditing a Key Management System for Compliance|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/simplifying-the-complex-process-of-auditing-a-key-management-system-for-compliance|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] can be achieved with respect to national and international [[data protection]] standards and regulations, such as [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]], [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]], or [[General Data Protection Regulation]].<ref name=\"Stubbs-Buyer's guide\">{{cite web|last1=Stubbs|first1=Rob|title=Buyer's Guide to Choosing a Crypto Key Management System|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/buyers-guide-to-choosing-a-crypto-key-management-system|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management and compliance systems==\n\n===Key management system===\nA ''key management system'' (KMS), also known as a ''cryptographic key management system'' (CKMS), is an integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] for devices and applications. They may cover all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure key handling and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for [[key generation]], distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices.\n\n===Standards-based key management===\n\nMany specific applications have developed their own key management systems with home grown protocols.  However, as systems become more interconnected keys need to be shared between those different systems.  To facilitate this, key management standards have evolved to define the protocols used to manage and exchange cryptographic keys and related information.\n\n===Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)===\n{{Main|Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)}}\n\nKMIP is an extensible key management protocol that has been developed by many organizations working within the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS standards body]].  The first version was released in 2010, and it has been further developed by an active technical committee.\n\nThe protocol allows for the creation of keys and their distribution among disparate software systems that need to utilize them.  It covers the full key life cycle of both symmetric and asymmetric keys in a variety of formats, the wrapping of keys, provisioning schemes, and cryptographic operations as well as meta data associated with the keys.\n\nThe protocol is backed by an extensive series of test cases, and interoperability testing is performed between compliant systems each year.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:KMIP Tests Performed 2017 B.png|Individual interoperability tests performed by each server/client vendor combination since 2012\nFile:KMIPServerTestResults2017-B.png|Results of 2017 OASIS KMIP interoperability testing\n</gallery>\n\nA list of some 80 products that conform to the KMIP standard can be found on [https://wiki.oasis-open.org/kmip/KnownKMIPImplementations the OASIS website].\n\n===Non-KMIP-compliant key management===\n\n====Open source====\n\n* Barbican, the OpenStack security API.<ref>https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Barbican</ref>\n* KeyBox - web-based SSH access and key management.<ref>http://sshkeybox.com/</ref>\n* EPKS - Echo Public Key Share, system to share encryption keys online in a p2p community.<ref>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Big_Seven_Study</ref>\n* Kmc-Subset137<ref>http://www.kmc-subset137.eu/</ref> - key management system implementing UNISIG Subset-137 <ref>http://www.era.europa.eu/Document-Register/Documents/SUBSET-137%20v100.pdf</ref> for [[ERTMS]]/[[ETCS]] railway application.\n* [[privacyIDEA]] - two factor management with support for managing SSH keys.<ref>http://privacyidea.org</ref>\n* StrongKey - open source, last updated on Sourceforge in 2016.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/strongkey/</ref> There is no more maintenance on this project according to its home page.\n* Vault - secret server from [[HashiCorp]].<ref>http://vaultproject.io/</ref>\n* [http://keeto.io/ Keeto]\n* [https://nucypher.com/ NuCypher]\n* [https://secrethub.io/ SecretHub] - end-to-end encrypted SaaS key management\n\n====Closed source====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Amazon Web Service (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) <ref>https://aws.amazon.com/kms/</ref>\n* Bell ID Key Manager<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bellid.com/products/key-manager |title=Key Management System |publisher=Bell ID |accessdate=2014-01-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140117141733/http://www.bellid.com/products/key-manager |archivedate=2014-01-17 }}</ref>\n* [[Cryptomathic|Cryptomathic CKMS]]<ref name=\"Cryptomathic Key\">{{cite web|last1=Landrock|first1=Peter|title=Cryptomathic Key Management System|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/products/key-management/crypto-key-management-system|website=cryptomathic.com/|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n* Cryptsoft KMIP C and Java Servers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptsoft.com/KMIP/ |title=Cryptsoft |publisher=Cryptsoft |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n* [https://netlibsecurity.com/enterprise-manager/ Encryptionizer Key Manager (Windows only)]\n* Fornetix Key Orchestration<ref>=http://fornetix.com/products/</ref>\n* [[Futurex]] Key Management<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurex.com/products/category/key-management-servers |title=Futurex Key Management Servers |publisher=Futurex.com |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n* Gazzang zTrustee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzang.com/products/ztrustee |title=Gazzang zTrustee |publisher=Gazzang.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n* HP Enterprise Secure Key Manager<ref>{{cite web |author=United States |url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/HP_Enterprise_Secure_Key_Manager/index.aspx?jumpid=reg_r1002_usen |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710061028/http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/HP_Enterprise_Secure_Key_Manager/index.aspx?jumpid=reg_r1002_usen |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=Data Encryption - Enterprise Secure Key Manager &#124;

Using the keys, the users can encrypt their messages and send them secretly. IETF.org released RFC 4046, entitled Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture, which discusses the challenges of group key management.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4046 |title=Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture |website=ietf.org |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dynamic secrets]]\n* [[Hardware security]]\n* [[Key ceremony]]\n* [[Key derivation function]]\n* [[Key distribution center]]\n* [[Key encapsulation]]\n* [[Key management (access control)|Physical key management]]\n* [[Keystore]]\n* [[KMIP]]\n* [[KSD-64]]\n* [[List of cryptographic key types]]\n* [[NSA]]'s [[Electronic Key Management System]] (EKMS)\n* [[Over-the-air rekeying]]\n* [[Pseudorandom function family]]\n* [[Public key infrastructure]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''Recommendation for Key Management \u2014 Part 1: general,'' [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4 NIST Special Publication 800-57]\n* [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/ NIST ''Cryptographic Toolkit'']\nQ* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080406010652/http://siswg.net/ ''The IEEE Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG) that is creating the P1619.3 standard for Key Management'']\n* [http://www.ansi.org/ '' American National Standards Institute] - ANSI X9.24, Retail Financial Services Symmetric Key Management\n* [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=kmip ''The OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) Technical Committee '']\n* [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ekmi ''The OASIS Enterprise Key Management Infrastructure (EKMI)Technical Committee '']\n* [https://www.p6r.com/articles/2011/06/05/key-management-with-a-powerful-keystore \"Key Management with a Powerful Keystore\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160227032901/http://www.senergy.net.in/KeyManagementSystem.aspx \"Intelligent Key Management System - KeyGuard | Senergy Intellution\"]\n* [https://www.ibm.com/in-en/marketplace/ibm-security-key-lifecycle-manager IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager, SKLM]\n\n[[Category:Key management| ]]\n[[Category:Data security]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Management of cryptographic keys}}\n{{other uses}}\n'''Key management''' refers to management  of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] in a [[cryptosystem]]. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, [[crypto-shredding]] (destruction) and replacement of keys. It includes [[cryptographic protocol]] design, [[Key server (cryptographic)|key server]]s, user procedures, and other relevant protocols.<ref name=\"Turner-What-is-key-management\">{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What Is Key Management? A CISO Perspective|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-key-management-a-ciso-perspective|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nKey management concerns keys at the user level, either between users or systems. This is in contrast to [[key scheduling]], which typically refers to the internal handling of keys within the operation of a cipher.\n\nSuccessful key management is critical to the security of a cryptosystem. It is the more challenging side of [[cryptography]] in a sense that it involves aspects of social engineering such as system policy, user training, organizational and departmental interactions, and coordination between all of these elements, in contrast to pure mathematical practices that can be automated.\n\n==Types of keys==\n{{main|Cryptographic key types}}\nCryptographic systems may use different types of keys, with some systems using more than one. These may include symmetric keys or asymmetric keys. In a [[symmetric key algorithm]] the keys involved are identical for both encrypting and decrypting a message. Keys must be chosen carefully, and distributed and stored securely. Asymmetric keys, also known as [[Public-key cryptography|public keys]], in contrast are two distinct keys that are mathematically linked. They are typically used together to communicate. Public key infrastructure (PKI), the implementation of public key cryptography,  requires an organization to establish an infrastructure to create and manage public and private key pairs along with digital certificates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Randall|last2=Panko|first2=Ray|title=Corporate Computer Security|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River New Jersey|page=278|edition=Fourth}}</ref>\n\n==Inventory==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe starting point in any certificate and private key management strategy is to create a comprehensive inventory of all certificates, their locations and responsible parties. This is not a trivial matter because certificates from a variety of sources are deployed in a variety of locations by different individuals and teams - it's simply not possible to rely on a list from a single [[certificate authority]]. Certificates that are not renewed and replaced before they expire can cause serious downtime and outages. Some other considerations:\n*Regulations and requirements, like PCI-DSS, demand stringent security and management of cryptographic keys and auditors are increasingly reviewing the management controls and processes in use.\n*Private keys used with certificates must be kept secure or unauthorised individuals can intercept confidential communications or gain unauthorised access to critical systems. Failure to ensure proper segregation of duties means that admins who generate the encryption keys can use them to access sensitive, regulated data.\n*If a certificate authority is compromised or an encryption algorithm is broken, organizations must be prepared to replace all of their certificates and keys in a matter of hours.\n\n==Management steps==\nOnce keys are inventoried, key management typically consists of three steps: exchange, storage and use.\n\n===Key exchange===\n{{Main|Key exchange}}\nPrior to any secured communication, users must set up the details of the cryptography. In some instances this may require exchanging identical keys (in the case of a symmetric key system). In others it may require possessing the other party's public key. While public keys can be openly exchanged (their corresponding private key is kept secret), symmetric keys must be exchanged over a secure communication channel. Formerly, exchange of such a key was extremely troublesome, and was greatly eased by access to secure channels such as a [[diplomatic bag]]. [[Clear text]] exchange of symmetric keys would enable any interceptor to immediately learn the key, and any encrypted data.\n\nThe advance of public key cryptography in the 1970s has made the exchange of keys less troublesome. Since the [[Diffie-Hellman]] key exchange protocol was published in 1975, it has become possible to exchange a key over an insecure communications channel, which has substantially reduced the risk of key disclosure during distribution. It is possible, using something akin to a [[book code]], to include key indicators as clear text attached to an encrypted message. The encryption technique used by [[Richard Sorge]]'s code clerk was of this type, referring to a page in a statistical manual, though it was in fact a code. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] symmetric encryption key was a mixed type early in its use; the key was a combination of secretly distributed key schedules and a user chosen session key component for each message.\n\nIn more modern systems, such as [[OpenPGP]] compatible systems, a session key for a symmetric key algorithm is distributed encrypted by an [[asymmetric key algorithm]]. This approach avoids even the necessity for using a key exchange protocol like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nAnother method of key exchange involves encapsulating one key within another. Typically a master key is generated and exchanged using some secure method. This method is usually cumbersome or expensive (breaking a master key into multiple parts and sending each with a trusted courier for example) and not suitable for use on a larger scale. Once the master key has been securely exchanged, it can then be used to securely exchange subsequent keys with ease. This technique is usually termed [[key wrap]]. A common technique uses [[block cipher]]s and cryptographic [[hash function]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pressestelle Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum - Online-Redaktion |url=http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0809.html |title=Startseite - Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum |language=de |publisher=Crypto.rub.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nA related method is to exchange a master key (sometimes termed a root key) and derive subsidiary keys as needed from that key and some other data (often referred to as diversification data). The most common use for this method is probably in [[smartcard]]-based cryptosystems, such as those found in banking cards. The bank or credit network embeds their secret key into the card's secure key storage during card production at a secured production facility. Then at the [[point of sale]] the card and card reader are both able to derive a common set of session keys based on the shared secret key and card-specific data (such as the card serial number). This method can also be used when keys must be related to each other (i.e., departmental keys are tied to divisional keys, and individual keys tied to departmental keys). However, tying keys to each other in this way increases the damage which may result from a security breach as attackers will learn something about more than one key. This reduces entropy, with regard to an attacker, for each key involved.\n\n===Key storage===\nHowever distributed, keys must be stored securely to maintain communications security. Security is a big concern<ref name=\"Crain's New York\">{{cite web|title=An ancient technology gets a key makeover|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131120/TECHNOLOGY/131129993/an-ancient-technology-gets-a-key-makeover|website=Crain's New York Business|publisher=Crain's New York|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> and hence there are various techniques in use to do so. Likely the most common is that an encryption application manages keys for the user and depends on an access password to control use of the key. Likewise, in the case of smartphone keyless access platforms, they keep all identifying door information off mobile phones and servers and encrypt all data, where just like low-tech keys, users give codes only to those they trust.<ref name=\"Crain's New York\"/>\n\n===Key use===\nThe major issue is length of time a key is to be used, and therefore frequency of replacement. Because it increases any attacker's required effort, keys should be frequently changed. This also limits loss of information, as the number of stored encrypted messages which will become readable when a key is found will decrease as the frequency of key change increases. Historically, symmetric keys have been used for long periods in situations in which key exchange was very difficult or only possible intermittently. Ideally, the symmetric key should change with each message or interaction, so that only that message will become readable if the key is learned (''e.g.'', stolen, cryptanalyzed, or social engineered).\n\n==Challenges==\nSeveral challenges IT organizations face when trying to control and manage their encryption keys are:\n# Scalability: Managing a large number of encryption keys.\n# Security: Vulnerability of keys from outside hackers, malicious insiders.\n# Availability: Ensuring data accessibility for authorized users.\n# Heterogeneity: Supporting multiple databases, applications and standards.\n# Governance: Defining policy-driven access control and protection for data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Tina-stewart/security-policy-and-enterprise-key-management-from-vormetric |title=Security Policy and Key Management: Centrally Manage Encryption Key |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref> Governance includes compliance with [[Information privacy|data protection]] requirements.\n\n==Compliance==\nKey management compliance refers to the oversight, assurance and capability of being able to demonstrate that keys are securely managed. This includes the following individual compliance domains:\n\n* ''Physical security'' \u2013 the most visible form of compliance, which may include locked doors to secure system equipment and surveillance cameras. These safeguards can prevent unauthorized access to printed copies of key material and computer systems that run key management software.\n* ''Logical security'' \u2013 protects the organization against the theft or unauthorized access of information. This is where the use of cryptographic keys comes in by encrypting data, which is then rendered useless to those who do not have the key to decrypt it.\n* ''Personnel security'' \u2013 this involves assigning specific roles or privileges to personnel to access information on a strict need-to-know basis. Background checks should be performed on new employees along with periodic role changes to ensure security.<ref name=\"Turner-What-is-key-management\" /><ref name=\"Reinholm-KeyManagementCompliance\">{{cite web|last1=Reinholm|first1=James H.|title=Simplifying the Complex Process of Auditing a Key Management System for Compliance|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/simplifying-the-complex-process-of-auditing-a-key-management-system-for-compliance|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] can be achieved with respect to national and international [[data protection]] standards and regulations, such as [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]], [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]], or [[General Data Protection Regulation]].<ref name=\"Stubbs-Buyer's guide\">{{cite web|last1=Stubbs|first1=Rob|title=Buyer's Guide to Choosing a Crypto Key Management System|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/buyers-guide-to-choosing-a-crypto-key-management-system|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management and compliance systems==\n\n===Key management system===\nA ''key management system'' (KMS), also known as a ''cryptographic key management system'' (CKMS), is an integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] for devices and applications. They may cover all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure key handling and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for [[key generation]], distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices.\n\n===Standards-based key management===\n\nMany specific applications have developed their own key management systems with home grown protocols.  However, as systems become more interconnected keys need to be shared between those different systems.  To facilitate this, key management standards have evolved to define the protocols used to manage and exchange cryptographic keys and related information.\n\n===Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)===\n{{Main|Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)}}\n\nKMIP is an extensible key management protocol that has been developed by many organizations working within the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS standards body]].  The first version was released in 2010, and it has been further developed by an active technical committee.\n\nThe protocol allows for the creation of keys and their distribution among disparate software systems that need to utilize them.  It covers the full key life cycle of both symmetric and asymmetric keys in a variety of formats, the wrapping of keys, provisioning schemes, and cryptographic operations as well as meta data associated with the keys.\n\nThe protocol is backed by an extensive series of test cases, and interoperability testing is performed between compliant systems each year.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:KMIP Tests Performed 2017 B.png|Individual interoperability tests performed by each server/client vendor combination since 2012\nFile:KMIPServerTestResults2017-B.png|Results of 2017 OASIS KMIP interoperability testing\n</gallery>\n\nA list of some 80 products that conform to the KMIP standard can be found on [https://wiki.oasis-open.org/kmip/KnownKMIPImplementations the OASIS website].\n\n===Non-KMIP-compliant key management===\n\n====Open source====\n\n* Barbican, the OpenStack security API.<ref>https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Barbican</ref>\n* KeyBox - web-based SSH access and key management.<ref>http://sshkeybox.com/</ref>\n* EPKS - Echo Public Key Share, system to share encryption keys online in a p2p community.<ref>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Big_Seven_Study</ref>\n* Kmc-Subset137<ref>http://www.kmc-subset137.eu/</ref> - key management system implementing UNISIG Subset-137 <ref>http://www.era.europa.eu/Document-Register/Documents/SUBSET-137%20v100.pdf</ref> for [[ERTMS]]/[[ETCS]] railway application.\n* [[privacyIDEA]] - two factor management with support for managing SSH keys.<ref>http://privacyidea.org</ref>\n* StrongKey - open source, last updated on Sourceforge in 2016.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/strongkey/</ref> There is no more maintenance on this project according to its home page.\n* Vault - secret server from [[HashiCorp]].<ref>http://vaultproject.io/</ref>\n* [http://keeto.io/ Keeto]\n* [https://nucypher.com/ NuCypher]\n* [https://secrethub.io/ SecretHub] - end-to-end encrypted SaaS key management\n\n====Closed source====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Amazon Web Service (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) <ref>https://aws.amazon.com/kms/</ref>\n* Bell ID Key Manager<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bellid.com/products/key-manager |title=Key Management System |publisher=Bell ID |accessdate=2014-01-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140117141733/http://www.bellid.com/products/key-manager |archivedate=2014-01-17 }}</ref>\n* [[Cryptomathic|Cryptomathic CKMS]]<ref name=\"Cryptomathic Key\">{{cite web|last1=Landrock|first1=Peter|title=Cryptomathic Key Management System|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/products/key-management/crypto-key-management-system|website=cryptomathic.com/|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n* Cryptsoft KMIP C and Java Servers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptsoft.com/KMIP/ |title=Cryptsoft |publisher=Cryptsoft |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n* [https://netlibsecurity.com/enterprise-manager/ Encryptionizer Key Manager (Windows only)]\n* Fornetix Key Orchestration<ref>=http://fornetix.com/products/</ref>\n* [[Futurex]] Key Management<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurex.com/products/category/key-management-servers |title=Futurex Key Management Servers |publisher=Futurex.com |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n* Gazzang zTrustee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzang.com/products/ztrustee |title=Gazzang zTrustee |publisher=Gazzang.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n* HP Enterprise Secure Key Manager<ref>{{cite web |author=United States |url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/HP_Enterprise_Secure_Key_Manager/index.aspx?jumpid=reg_r1002_usen |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710061028/http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/HP_Enterprise_Secure_Key_Manager/index.aspx?jumpid=reg_r1002_usen |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=Data Encryption - Enterprise Secure Key Manager &#124;

Using the keys, the users can encrypt their messages and send them secretly. IETF.org released RFC 4046, entitled Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture, which discusses the challenges of group key management.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4046 |title=Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture |website=ietf.org |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dynamic secrets]]\n* [[Hardware security]]\n* [[Key ceremony]]\n* [[Key derivation function]]\n* [[Key distribution center]]\n* [[Key encapsulation]]\n* [[Key management (access control)|Physical key management]]\n* [[Keystore]]\n* [[KMIP]]\n* [[KSD-64]]\n* [[List of cryptographic key types]]\n* [[NSA]]'s [[Electronic Key Management System]] (EKMS)\n* [[Over-the-air rekeying]]\n* [[Pseudorandom function family]]\n* [[Public key infrastructure]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''Recommendation for Key Management \u2014 Part 1: general,'' [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4 NIST Special Publication 800-57]\n* [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/ NIST ''Cryptographic Toolkit'']\nQ* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080406010652/http://siswg.net/ ''The IEEE Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG) that is creating the P1619.3 standard for Key Management'']\n* [http://www.ansi.org/ '' American National Standards Institute] - ANSI X9.24, Retail Financial Services Symmetric Key Management\n* [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=kmip ''The OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) Technical Committee '']\n* [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ekmi ''The OASIS Enterprise Key Management Infrastructure (EKMI)Technical Committee '']\n* [https://www.p6r.com/articles/2011/06/05/key-management-with-a-powerful-keystore \"Key Management with a Powerful Keystore\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160227032901/http://www.senergy.net.in/KeyManagementSystem.aspx \"Intelligent Key Management System - KeyGuard | Senergy Intellution\"]\n* [https://www.ibm.com/in-en/marketplace/ibm-security-key-lifecycle-manager IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager, SKLM]\n\n[[Category:Key management| ]]\n[[Category:Data security]]\n", "name_user": "Quicksolution", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management"}
