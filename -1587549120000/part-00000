The hospital was renamed Western State Hospital in 1894.\n\nIn its early days, the facility was a resort-style asylum. It had terraced gardens where patients could plant flowers and take walks, roof walks to provide mountain views, and many architectural details to create an atmosphere that would aid in the healing process.  However, by the mid 19th Century, this utopian model of care had vanished, replaced by overcrowding in the facility and the warehousing of patients.  Techniques such as \"ankle and wrist restraints, physical coercion, and straitjackets\" were used.<ref name=commits />   After the passage of the Eugenical Sterilization Act of 1924 in Virginia,<ref>HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 607 (HJ607ER), \"Expressing the General Assembly's regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics\", [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?011+ful+HJ607ER Virginia Legislative Information System]</ref>  patients were forcibly sterilized at Western State<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Augusta Historical Bulletin | author = Amanda Brocato | title = The Campaign for Eugenics in Virginia: The Influence of Dr. J.S.

The prison closed in 2003, and the site was left vacant for several years.

Bhadrajun is made up of two words, the name of '[[Subhadra]]', sister of [[Lord Krishna]], plus '[[Arjuna]]', the third among the five [[Pandava]] brothers of Mahabharata. Initially, it was called \"Subhdr-arjun\" but over the years it was changed to the colloquial usage of the single word \"Bhadrajun\". The legend linked to this name is a story of romance.<ref name=jalore/>\n\nAccording to the ''Mahabharata'' legend, Lord Krishna advised Arjuna to marry sister from [[Dwarka]] (where she resided with her parents). The reason for Krishna's advice was because Arjuna, along with his four brothers, was under a [[vanvas]] (incognito living), as per the demand  of the Kauravas, for having lost their kingdom in a dice game. However, Arjuna, who was disguised as a saint, fell in love with the daughter of [[Vasudeva]] (maternal uncle of Arjuna), Subhadra. Arjuna spent the last year of his 13-year exile period in Dwarka. Krishna, who was aware of this fact, advised Arjuna to escape with his sister so that his true identity would not be revealed during the marriage. Identification would have resulted in a further 13 years in exile as per Pandava's pact with the Kauravas. It would have also invited the wrath of [[Balarama]], brother of Krishna who wanted the Kaurava king [[Duryodhana]] to marry Subhadra. Lord Krishna was not in favour of such an alliance as he was particularly attached to Arjuna, and wished nothing but the best for his sister Subhadra.<ref name=jalore/><ref name=fort>{{Cite web |url= http://www.bhadrajunfort.com/about_fort.htm|title=About Fort |work=The History |accessdate=2009-11-15 |publisher= Bhadrajunfort.com}}</ref><ref name=story>{{Cite web |url= http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/03-08/features951.htm |title= The Marriage of Arjun and Subhadra |accessdate=2009-11-15 |publisher= Hare Krishna.com}}</ref><ref name=Bhadra>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairytaleindia.com/package-book.php?pkgId=154&categId=20#POS6 |title=Marwar horse Safari |work=Bhadrajun |accessdate=2009-11-21 |quote=\u2026towards the historic castle of Bhadrajun.

After an arduous journey of three days and two nights, through mostly uninhabited forest area, they reached the valley near Bhadrajun where they decided to get married, before proceeding to [[Indraprastha]], their capital. The marriage was conducted by a local [[Brahmin]] priest. The Brahmin priest was given an [[earring]] (''vali'' in local language) by Subhadra and a [[conch-shell]] by Arjuna as fee for performing their marriage. The village of the Brahmin was named thereafter as \u2018sankhavali\u2019 (in the word \"sankavali\", \u2018sankh\u2019 means \u2018conch-shell\u2019 and \u2018vali\u2019 means \"ear ring\"). It is also said that Balarama, though furious initially with Arjuna did not chase him to stop the marriage. He was persuaded by Krishna and Vasudeva to forgive Arjuna and Subhadra, given that they were in love with each other. Convinced of this fact, Balarama later sent gifts to his sister - a [[dowry]] of jewellery, elephants, chariots, horses, servants and maidservants. Following this marriage, Bhadarjun grew in population. A small temple in the name of Subhadra, popularly known as the \"Dhumda Mata\", exists even now in a nearby village.<ref name=jalore/><ref name=fort/><ref name=story/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyandbike.be/Rajasthan%20individueel%202009.pdf|format=pdf|title=India Rajasthan|work=Day 8 Cycle to Bhadrajun|accessdate=2009-11-21|quote=According to the Mahabharata, the Pandava prince Arjun eloped with Subhadra, the sister of Lord Krishna and married in this valley.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134056/http://www.flyandbike.be/Rajasthan%20individueel%202009.pdf|archive-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Early history===\nWhile the mythological history of Bhadrajun is traced to Arjuna who lived in the [[treta yuga]], one of the four [[Hindu]] [[eras]] of ''Mahabharata''; the history of Bhadrajun and the Marwar rulers of Jodhpur can only be traced from the 16th century.

Bhadrajun is made up of two words, the name of '[[Subhadra]]', sister of [[Lord Krishna]], plus '[[Arjuna]]', the third among the five [[Pandava]] brothers of Mahabharata. Initially, it was called \"Subhdr-arjun\" but over the years it was changed to the colloquial usage of the single word \"Bhadrajun\". The legend linked to this name is a story of romance.<ref name=jalore/>\n\nAccording to the ''Mahabharata'' legend, Lord Krishna advised Arjuna to marry sister from [[Dwarka]] (where she resided with her parents). The reason for Krishna's advice was because Arjuna, along with his four brothers, was under a [[vanvas]] (incognito living), as per the demand  of the Kauravas, for having lost their kingdom in a dice game. However, Arjuna, who was disguised as a saint, fell in love with the daughter of [[Vasudeva]] (maternal uncle of Arjuna), Subhadra. Arjuna spent the last year of his 13-year exile period in Dwarka. Krishna, who was aware of this fact, advised Arjuna to escape with his sister so that his true identity would not be revealed during the marriage. Identification would have resulted in a further 13 years in exile as per Pandava's pact with the Kauravas. It would have also invited the wrath of [[Balarama]], brother of Krishna who wanted the Kaurava king [[Duryodhana]] to marry Subhadra. Lord Krishna was not in favour of such an alliance as he was particularly attached to Arjuna, and wished nothing but the best for his sister Subhadra.<ref name=jalore/><ref name=fort>{{Cite web |url= http://www.bhadrajunfort.com/about_fort.htm|title=About Fort |work=The History |accessdate=2009-11-15 |publisher= Bhadrajunfort.com}}</ref><ref name=story>{{Cite web |url= http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/03-08/features951.htm |title= The Marriage of Arjun and Subhadra |accessdate=2009-11-15 |publisher= Hare Krishna.com}}</ref><ref name=Bhadra>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairytaleindia.com/package-book.php?pkgId=154&categId=20#POS6 |title=Marwar horse Safari |work=Bhadrajun |accessdate=2009-11-21 |quote=\u2026towards the historic castle of Bhadrajun.

After an arduous journey of three days and two nights, through mostly uninhabited forest area, they reached the valley near Bhadrajun where they decided to get married, before proceeding to [[Indraprastha]], their capital. The marriage was conducted by a local [[Brahmin]] priest. The Brahmin priest was given an [[earring]] (''vali'' in local language) by Subhadra and a [[conch-shell]] by Arjuna as fee for performing their marriage. The village of the Brahmin was named thereafter as \u2018sankhavali\u2019 (in the word \"sankavali\", \u2018sankh\u2019 means \u2018conch-shell\u2019 and \u2018vali\u2019 means \"ear ring\"). It is also said that Balarama, though furious initially with Arjuna did not chase him to stop the marriage. He was persuaded by Krishna and Vasudeva to forgive Arjuna and Subhadra, given that they were in love with each other. Convinced of this fact, Balarama later sent gifts to his sister - a [[dowry]] of jewellery, elephants, chariots, horses, servants and maidservants. Following this marriage, Bhadarjun grew in population.
