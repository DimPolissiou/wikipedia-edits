Competing in the Spanish Road Racing Championship (Campeonato de Espa\u00f1a de Velocidad), BQR won three ''F\u00f3rmula Extreme'' and two ''125GP'' class titles with riders [[Jos\u00e9 David de Gea]], [[Stefan Bradl]] and [[Efr\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez]].\n\n===Grand Prix racing===\n====125cc and 250cc classes====\nAfter many wild card appearances in the World Championship, BQR became a full entry in the [[2001 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2001 season]] using [[Honda]] bikes in the 250cc class. In [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007]] the team switched to [[Aprilia]] machinery. BQR won its first World Championship race with [[Scott Redding]] riding an Aprilia 125 at the [[2008 British motorcycle Grand_Prix|2008 British Grand Prix]].\n\n==== Moto3 ====\nIn [[2017 Moto3 season|2017]], Avintia entered [[Vicente P\u00e9rez (motorcyclist)|Vicente P\u00e9rez]] in 2 races as a wildcard. For [[2018 Moto3 season|2018]] the team entered a single full-season entry, beginning the season with [[Livio Loi]] for the first seven rounds and replacing him with P\u00e9rez for the remainder of the season. In [[2019 Moto3 season|2019]] the team began with P\u00e9rez for the first seven rounds, but replacing him with [[Stefano Nepa]] for the remaining races, and addition to a number of wildcard entries for Nepa, [[Meikon Kawakami]], and [[Carlos Tatay]]. In [[2020 Moto3 season|2020]], Avintia entered Tatay as their sole full-season entry.\n\n====Moto2====\nThe team unveiled the first [[Moto2]] bike in February 2009 and fielded a prototype in the 2009 Spanish Road Racing Championship.  In [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010]], they participated in the new Moto2 World Championship, with [[Yonny Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Mashel Al Naimi]] as riders. The team continued in Moto2 until the conclusion of the [[2013 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2013]] season. In [[2018 Moto2 season|2018]], the team made a significant number of wildcard entries with rider [[Xavi Cardel\u00fas]].\n\n====MotoGP====\nIn {{MGP|2012}} the team changed its name to '''Avintia Racing''', following an alliance between BQR and the Grupo Avintia. The team debuted in the MotoGP class as a Claiming Rule Team using both [[FTR Moto]] and Inmotec frames badged as '''BQR''', powered by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] engines. The riders were [[Iv\u00e1n Silva (motorcyclist)|Iv\u00e1n Silva]] and [[Yonny Hern\u00e1ndez]]. In {{MGP|2013}} Avintia entered the MotoGP class with Kawasaki-engined FTR frames, fielding two bikes for [[Hiroshi Aoyama]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Barber\u00e1]].\n\nFor the {{MGP|2014}} season Aoyama was replaced by [[Mike Di Meglio]] and the team fielded a new bike badged as the ''Avintia GP14'', reportedly based on the 2007-2009 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-RR]] with some input from [[Kawasaki Motors Racing|Kawasaki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://motomatters.com/analysis/2014/07/16/the_comprehensive_midsummer_motogp_silly.html|title=The Comprehensive Midsummer MotoGP Silly Season Update|first=David|last=Emmett|work=MotoMatters.com|publisher=David Emmett|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2014/july/ducati-to-expand-to-six-bike-effort-in-motogp/|title=Ducati to expand to six bike effort in MotoGP|first=Matthew|last=Birt|work=MotorcycleNews.com|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Following a mid-season agreement between Avintia and [[Ducati]], Barber\u00e1 received an Open-specification [[Ducati Desmosedici]] for the last five rounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/209018/1/new-avintia-ducati-ready-for-aragon.html|title=Avintia Ducati unveiled at Aragon|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn {{MGP|2015}} the team entered two Open class [[Ducati Desmosedici|Desmosedici]] GP14 motorcycles, for Barber\u00e1 and Di Meglio. For {{MGP|2016}} Di Meglio was replaced by [[Loris Baz]]. In {{MGP|2017}} the team changed its name to Reale Esponsorama Racing.\n\nIn [[2018 MotoGP season|2018]], [[Tito Rabat]] and [[Xavier Sim\u00e9on]] joined the team. At the [[2018 British motorcycle Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], Rabat's major crash with [[Franco Morbidelli]] at Stowe corner was a contributing factor in the decision to cancel the race due to unsafe conditions. As a result of the triple fracture he sustained to his right leg, Rabat missed the remaining 7 races of the 2018 season, and was replaced by [[Christophe Ponsson]] and [[Jordi Torres]]. For [[2019 MotoGP season|2019]], Rabat returned and was partnered by Czech rider [[Karel Abraham]]. In [[2020 MotoGP season|2020]], Rabat was retained, this time paired with [[Johann Zarco]].\n\n==== MotoE ====\nAs a satellite team in MotoGP, Avintia was given an entry in the innaugural [[MotoE World Cup]] in [[2019 MotoE season|2019]]. The team achieved 2 wins with [[Eric Granado]] and 2 podiums with their former MotoGP rider [[Xavier Sim\u00e9on]], good for 3rd and 6th place in the championship, respectively. For the [[2020 MotoE season|2020 season]], the team retained Granado and partnered him with their former Moto2 rider, [[Andorra|Andorran]] [[Xavier Cardel\u00fas]]. Subesquently and combined with title sponsorship from Andorran firm Esponsorama, the team decided from 2020 to enter the MotoE team under an Andorran license as opposed to the Spanish license used in all other categories.\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Class\n!scope=\"col\"| Team name\n!scope=\"col\"|

Competing in the Spanish Road Racing Championship (Campeonato de Espa\u00f1a de Velocidad), BQR won three ''F\u00f3rmula Extreme'' and two ''125GP'' class titles with riders [[Jos\u00e9 David de Gea]], [[Stefan Bradl]] and [[Efr\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez]].\n\n===Grand Prix racing===\n====125cc and 250cc classes====\nAfter many wild card appearances in the World Championship, BQR became a full entry in the [[2001 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2001 season]] using [[Honda]] bikes in the 250cc class. In [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007]] the team switched to [[Aprilia]] machinery. BQR won its first World Championship race with [[Scott Redding]] riding an Aprilia 125 at the [[2008 British motorcycle Grand_Prix|2008 British Grand Prix]].\n\n==== Moto3 ====\nIn [[2017 Moto3 season|2017]], Avintia entered [[Vicente P\u00e9rez (motorcyclist)|Vicente P\u00e9rez]] in 2 races as a wildcard. For [[2018 Moto3 season|2018]] the team entered a single full-season entry, beginning the season with [[Livio Loi]] for the first seven rounds and replacing him with P\u00e9rez for the remainder of the season. In [[2019 Moto3 season|2019]] the team began with P\u00e9rez for the first seven rounds, but replacing him with [[Stefano Nepa]] for the remaining races, and addition to a number of wildcard entries for Nepa, [[Meikon Kawakami]], and [[Carlos Tatay]]. In [[2020 Moto3 season|2020]], Avintia entered Tatay as their sole full-season entry.\n\n====Moto2====\nThe team unveiled the first [[Moto2]] bike in February 2009 and fielded a prototype in the 2009 Spanish Road Racing Championship.  In [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010]], they participated in the new Moto2 World Championship, with [[Yonny Hern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Mashel Al Naimi]] as riders. The team continued in Moto2 until the conclusion of the [[2013 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2013]] season. In [[2018 Moto2 season|2018]], the team made a significant number of wildcard entries with rider [[Xavi Cardel\u00fas]].\n\n====MotoGP====\nIn {{MGP|2012}} the team changed its name to '''Avintia Racing''', following an alliance between BQR and the Grupo Avintia. The team debuted in the MotoGP class as a Claiming Rule Team using both [[FTR Moto]] and Inmotec frames badged as '''BQR''', powered by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] engines. The riders were [[Iv\u00e1n Silva (motorcyclist)|Iv\u00e1n Silva]] and [[Yonny Hern\u00e1ndez]]. In {{MGP|2013}} Avintia entered the MotoGP class with Kawasaki-engined FTR frames, fielding two bikes for [[Hiroshi Aoyama]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Barber\u00e1]].\n\nFor the {{MGP|2014}} season Aoyama was replaced by [[Mike Di Meglio]] and the team fielded a new bike badged as the ''Avintia GP14'', reportedly based on the 2007-2009 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-RR]] with some input from [[Kawasaki Motors Racing|Kawasaki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://motomatters.com/analysis/2014/07/16/the_comprehensive_midsummer_motogp_silly.html|title=The Comprehensive Midsummer MotoGP Silly Season Update|first=David|last=Emmett|work=MotoMatters.com|publisher=David Emmett|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2014/july/ducati-to-expand-to-six-bike-effort-in-motogp/|title=Ducati to expand to six bike effort in MotoGP|first=Matthew|last=Birt|work=MotorcycleNews.com|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Following a mid-season agreement between Avintia and [[Ducati]], Barber\u00e1 received an Open-specification [[Ducati Desmosedici]] for the last five rounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/209018/1/new-avintia-ducati-ready-for-aragon.html|title=Avintia Ducati unveiled at Aragon|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn {{MGP|2015}} the team entered two Open class [[Ducati Desmosedici|Desmosedici]] GP14 motorcycles, for Barber\u00e1 and Di Meglio. For {{MGP|2016}} Di Meglio was replaced by [[Loris Baz]]. In {{MGP|2017}} the team changed its name to Reale Esponsorama Racing.\n\nIn [[2018 MotoGP season|2018]], [[Tito Rabat]] and [[Xavier Sim\u00e9on]] joined the team. At the [[2018 British motorcycle Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], Rabat's major crash with [[Franco Morbidelli]] at Stowe corner was a contributing factor in the decision to cancel the race due to unsafe conditions. As a result of the triple fracture he sustained to his right leg, Rabat missed the remaining 7 races of the 2018 season, and was replaced by [[Christophe Ponsson]] and [[Jordi Torres]]. For [[2019 MotoGP season|2019]], Rabat returned and was partnered by Czech rider [[Karel Abraham]]. In [[2020 MotoGP season|2020]], Rabat was retained, this time paired with [[Johann Zarco]].\n\n==== MotoE ====\nAs a satellite team in MotoGP, Avintia was given an entry in the innaugural [[MotoE World Cup]] in [[2019 MotoE season|2019]]. The team achieved 2 wins with [[Eric Granado]] and 2 podiums with their former MotoGP rider [[Xavier Sim\u00e9on]], good for 3rd and 6th place in the championship, respectively. For the [[2020 MotoE season|2020 season]], the team retained Granado and partnered him with their former Moto2 rider, [[Andorra|Andorran]] [[Xavier Cardel\u00fas]]. Subesquently and combined with title sponsorship from Andorran firm Esponsorama, the team decided from 2020 to enter the MotoE team under an Andorran license as opposed to the Spanish license used in all other categories.\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Class\n!scope=\"col\"| Team name\n!scope=\"col\"|

{"title_page": "History of the State of Palestine", "text_new": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{pp-30-500|small=yes}}\n{{History of Palestine}}\n\nThe '''history of the State of Palestine''' describes the creation and evolution of the [[State of Palestine]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].\n\nDuring the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory period]], numerous plans of partition of Palestine were proposed but without the agreement of all parties. In 1947, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was voted. This triggered the [[1947\u20131949 Palestine war]] and led, in 1948, to the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] on a part of Mandate Palestine as the Mandate came to an end. Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state. In 1969, for example, the PLO proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. This proposal was rejected by Israel, as it would have amounted to the disbanding of the state of Israel. The basis of the current proposals is for a [[two-state solution]] on either a portion of or the entirety of the [[Palestinian territories]]\u2014the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], which have been [[military occupation|occupied]] by Israel since 1967.\n\n==Background==\n===Ottoman era===\nAt the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following [[World War I]], the victorious European states divided many of its component regions into newly created states under [[League of Nations mandate]]s according to deals that had been struck with other interested parties.<ref>Boundaries Delimitation: Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Yitzhak Gil-Har, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 68-81: \"Palestine and Transjordan emerged as states; This was in consequence of British War commitments to its allies during the First World War.</ref> In the Middle East, [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] (including the Ottoman autonomous Christian Lebanon and the surrounding areas that became the Republic of Lebanon) came under French control, while [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] were allotted to the British.\n\nMost of these states achieved independence during the following three decades without great difficulty, though in some regimes, the colonial legacy continued through the granting of exclusive rights to market/manufacture oil and maintain troops to defend it.{{citation needed|reason=which regimes?|date=July 2015}} However, the case of Palestine remained problematic.\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] was on the rise after World War II, possibly following the example of European nationalism. [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] beliefs called for the creation of a single, secular state for all Arabs.\n\n===Mandate Period===\n[[File:Proposals for the Mandate of Palestine 1916-19.svg|thumb|Three proposals for the post World War I administration of Palestine:\n{{legend|border=darkred solid|white|\"International Administration\" proposed in the 1916 [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]]}}<br />\n{{legend|border=blue dashed 2px |white|1919 [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] proposal at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]}}<br />\n{{legend|border=blue solid|white|Final borders of the 1923\u201348 [[Mandatory Palestine]]}}]]\n{{See also|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandatory Palestine}}\nIn 1917 the British Government issued the [[Balfour Declaration]] which declared British support for the creation in Palestine of a \"[[national home for the Jewish people]]\". The declaration was enthusiastically received by many Jews worldwide, but was opposed by Palestinian and Arab leaders, who later claimed that the objective was a breach of promises made to the [[Sharif of Mecca]] in 1915, in exchange for Arab help fighting the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]].\n\nMany different proposals have been made and continue to be made to resolve the dilemma of the competing objectives, including an Arab state, with or without a significant Jewish population, a Jewish state, with or without a significant Arab population, a [[Isratine|single bi-national state]], with or without some degree of cantonization, two states, one bi-national and one Arab, with or without some form of federation, and two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with or without some form of federation.\n\nAt the same times, many Arab leaders maintained that Palestine should join a larger Arab state covering the imprecise region of the [[Levant]]. These hopes were expressed in the [[Faisal\u2013Weizmann Agreement]], which was signed by soon-to-be Iraqi ruler [[Faisal I]] and the Zionist leader [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Despite this, the promise of a Pan-Arab state including Palestine were dashed as [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]] declared independence from their European rulers, while western Palestine festered in the developing Arab-Jewish conflict.\n\nIn light of these developments, Arabs began calling for both their own state in the British Mandate of Palestine and an end to the British support of the [[Jewish homeland]]'s creation and to [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]]. The movement gained steam through the 1920s and 1930s as Jewish immigration picked up. Under pressure from the arising nationalist movement, the British enforced the White Papers, a series of laws greatly restricting Jewish immigration and the sale of lands to Jews. The laws, passed in [[Churchill White Paper, 1922|1922]], 1930, and [[White Paper of 1939|1939]], varied in severity, but all attempted to find a balance between British sympathies with the Jews and the Arabs.\n\n====McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence (1915\u201316)====\n{{See also|McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence}}\n[[File:Ottoman Syria 1918.png|thumb|right|250px|Administrative units in the [[Levant]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]], until c. 1918]]\nIn the early years of [[World War I]], negotiations took place between the [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|British High Commissioner]] in Egypt [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] and [[Sharif of Mecca]] [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husayn bin Ali]] for an alliance of sorts between the Allies and the Arabs in the Near East against the Ottomans. On 24 October 1915, McMahon sent to Hussein a note which the Arabs came to regard as their \"Declaration of Independence\". In [[McMahon letters|McMahon's letter]], part of the [[McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence]], McMahon declared Britain's willingness to recognise the independence of the Arabs, both in the Levant and the Hejaz, subject to certain exemptions. It stated on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that:\n<blockquote>\nThe two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded.<br /><br />\nWith the above modification, and without prejudice of our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits.<br /><br />\nAs for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:\n# Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Henry |last1=McMahon |author1-link=Henry McMahon (diplomat) |title=The Hussein-MacMahon Correspondence: Letter No. 4 |date=24 October 1915 |accessdate=June 16, 2014 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/hussmac1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020728145031/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/hussmac1.html |archive-date=28 July 2002 |url-status=live |publisher=The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe exemptions from Arab control of certain areas set out in the McMahon note were to seriously complicate the problems of peace in the Near East. At the time, the Arab portions of the Ottoman Empire were divided into administrative units called ''vilayets'' and ''sanjaks''. Palestine was divided into the ''sanjuks'' of Acre and Nablus, both of which were a part of the [[vilayet of Beirut]], and an independent ''sanjak'' of Jerusalem. The areas exempted from Arab control by the McMahon note included \"Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.\" Between 1916\u201320, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the [[Churchill White Paper]] they argued instead that \"Damascus\" meant the ''vilayet'' and not the city of Damascus, and accordingly virtually all of Palestine was excluded from Arab control. The British entered into the secret [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] on 16 May 1916 and the commitment of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], for example, on that understanding.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe Arabs, however, insisted at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] at the end of the war that \"Damascus\" meant the city of Damascus&nbsp;\u2013 which left Palestine in their hands.<ref>[[Howard Sachar|Sachar, Howard Morley]] (1977).

The Mandate was administered as two territories: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]],<ref name=Whiteman>See Marjorie M. Whiteman, ''Digest of International Law'', vol. 1, U.S. State Department (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp 650\u2013652</ref> with the Jordan River being the boundary between them. The boundaries under the Mandate also did not follow those sought by the Jewish community, which sought the inclusion of the east bank of the Jordan into the Palestinian territory, to which the objective of the Mandate for a [[homeland for the Jewish people]] would apply. It was made clear from before the commencement of the Mandate, and a clause to that effect was inserted in the Mandate, that the objective set out in the Mandate would not apply to Transjordan following the passing of the [[Transjordan memorandum]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Transjordan was destined for early independence. The objective of the Mandate was to apply only to territory west of the Jordan, which was commonly referred to as Palestine by the British administration, and as [[Eretz Israel]] by the [[Hebrew]]-speaking Jewish population.\n\n====Peel Commission (1936\u201337)====\n{{Main|Peel Commission}}\n[[File:Peelmap-a.png|right|180px|thumb|Peel Commission, partition plan A, November 1937]]\nDuring the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine]] the British government formed the [[Peel Commission]], which recommended the formation of a Jewish and an Arab state. It called for a small Jewish state in the Galilee and maritime strip, a British enclave stretching from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jaffa]], and an Arab state covering the rest.<ref name=\"unispal\">{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/08e38a718201458b052565700072b358?OpenDocument |title=Report of the Palestine Royal Commission, presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the United Kingdom Parliament by Command of His Britannic Majesty (July 1937) |publisher=Domino.un.org |date=1937-11-30 |accessdate=2010-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231091409/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/08e38a718201458b052565700072b358?OpenDocument |archivedate=2010-12-31 }}</ref> The Commission recommended the creation of a small Jewish state in a region less than 1/5 of the total area of Palestine. The Arab area was to be joined to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. The Arab population in the Jewish areas was to be removed, by force if necessary, and vice versa, although this would mean the movement of far more Arabs than Jews. The Zionist Congress rejected the proposal, while allowing the leadership to continue negotiating with the British.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aaron S.

It all came to nothing, as the British government shelved the proposal altogether by the middle of 1938.\n\nIn February 1939, the [[St. James Conference]] convened in London, but the Arab delegation refused to formally meet with its Jewish counterpart or to recognize them. The Conference ended on March 17, 1939 without making any progress. On May 17, 1939, the British government issued the [[White Paper of 1939]], in which the idea of partitioning the Mandate was abandoned in favor of Jews and Arabs sharing one government and put strict quotas on further Jewish immigration. Because of impending [[World War II]] and the opposition from all sides, the plan was dropped.\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) gave a boost to the Jewish nationalism, as the [[Holocaust]] reaffirmed their call for a Jewish homeland. At the same time, many Arab leaders had even supported [[Nazi Germany]], a fact which could not play well with the British. As a result, Britain pooled its energy into winning over Arab opinions by abandoning the Balfour Declaration and the terms of the League of Nations mandate which had been entrusted to it in order to create a \"Jewish National Home\". Britain did this by issuing the 1939 white paper which officially allowed a further 75,000 Jews to move over five years (10,000 a year plus an additional 25,000) which was to be followed by Arab majority independence. The British would later claim that that quota had already been fulfilled by those who had entered without its approval.\n\n====The Arab League and the Arab Higher Committee (1945)====\nThe framers of the Arab League sought to include the Palestinian Arabs within the framework of the League from its inception.<ref>Geddes, 1991, p. 208.</ref> An annex to the League Pact declared:<ref>{{cite web|author=Head of states of the founding members |title=Pact of the League of Arab States, March 22, 1945 |work=[[The Avalon Project]] |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arableag.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991007232840/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arableag.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 October 1999 |accessdate=9 July 2008 }}</ref>\n<blockquote>Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her.

Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence.</blockquote>\n\nIn November 1945, the [[Arab League]] reconstituted the Arab Higher Committee comprising twelve members<ref>{{Google books |id=jXKTSQrTLO8C |page=303 |title=Politics and government in the Middle East and North Africa}}, by Tareq Y.

The committee was dominated by the [[Palestine Arab Party]] and was immediately recognised by Arab League countries. The Mandate government recognised the new Committee two months later.

Rockwell of the State Department's Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation. Rifai asked when the U.S. was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the U.S. to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the U.S. accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the U.S. did in fact recognize the union.

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However, the Plan also provided that 'Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip', as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian/Gaza border, and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. <br />Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace, and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. ''[Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings.]'' Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter parts of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone, they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for, ''inter alia'', electricity, currency, telephone networks, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry, through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000, aside from a limited number of exceptions, Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry.<br />It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.|doi=10.1007/978-90-6704-811-8_14|series=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=International Law and the Classification of Conflicts|editor=Elizabeth Wilmshurst|first=Iain|last=Scobbie|authorlink=Iain Scobbie|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|isbn=9780199657759|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM90Xp03uuEC&pg=PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Prefiguring Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships|first=Michelle|last= Gawerc|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2012|isbn=9780739166109|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hka8FZ4UdWUC&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace.

According to Goldberg, the U.S. believed in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles, there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.<ref>Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, p. 981, Document 501.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. President's Special Assistant, [[Walt Rostow]], told Israeli ambassador [[Avraham Harman|Harmon]] that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the U.S. expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarisation arrangements rather than toward major changes in the armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration, but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including \"sovereignty\". Rostow said the U.S. government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.<ref>Foreign relations of the United States, 1964\u20131968, Volume XVIII Arab-Israeli Dispute, p. 996, Document 505.</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of fighting in Jordan in September 1970 between the Jordanian army and Palestinian guerilla, the US government began considering the creation of a separate Palestinian political entity. However, a Palestinian state was the least considered alternative. A State Department memo of 1970 stated in that regard:\n<blockquote>\nsuch a state would presumably have to be limited to the West Bank and Gaza, it would probably not be economically viable without the injection of large-scale outside financial assistance. Its political viability is also doubtful, since a large number of Palestinians would remain outside its borders and it would tend to be dominated by a larger and more powerful Israel.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v23/d182 Paper Prepared by the National Security Council Staff, November 13, 1970, ''Foreign Relations of the United States 1969-1976'', vol. 23]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n====PLO and the binational state solution====\nBefore the Six-Day War, the movement for an independent Palestine received a boost in 1964 when the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] was established. Its goal, as stated in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] was to create a Palestinian state in the whole British Mandate, a statement which nullified Israel's [[right to exist]]. The PLO would become the leading force in the Palestinian national movement politically, and its leader, Egyptian-born [[Yassir Arafat]], would become regarded as the leader of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn 1969, the Fatah movement, accepting as a ''fait accompli'' the presence in Palestine of a large number of Jews, declared that it was not fighting against Jews, but against Israel as a racist and theocratic entity. The fifth national council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in February 1969 passed a resolution confirming that the PLO's objective was \"to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews\". The PLO was not successful in building support for the binational solution within Israeli society, however, which lay the groundwork for an eventual re-scoping of the PLO's aim toward partition into two states.<ref>[http://mondediplo.com/2010/10/03binationalism A history of conflict between opposing ideals (Le Monde Diplomatique, Oct. 2010)]</ref>\n\n====Rift between Jordan and Palestinian leadership (1970)====\nAfter the events of [[Black September in Jordan]], the rift between the Palestinian leadership and the Kingdom of Jordan continued to widen. The Arab League affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to ''self-determination'' and called on all the Arab states, including Jordan, to undertake to defend Palestinian national unity and not to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs. The Arab League also 'affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated.' King \u1e24ussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament. Half of its members had been West Bank representatives. He renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank, and allowed the PLO to assume responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine. The Kingdom of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria no longer act as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people, or their territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seventh Arab League Summit Conference: Resolution on Palestine |date=28 October 1974 |website=UNISPAL.Un.org |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/63D9A930E2B428DF852572C0006D06B8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518111104/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/63D9A930E2B428DF852572C0006D06B8 |archive-date=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead |publisher=[[UNISPAL]] |location=[[Rabat, Morocco]] |quote=To affirm the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Ian J. |last1=Bickerton |title=Jordan: Renouncing Claims to the West Bank |date=21 January 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014 |website=Britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/23336/Renouncing-claims-to-the-West-Bank |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616023317/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/23336/Renouncing-claims-to-the-West-Bank |archive-date=16 June 2014 |url-status=live |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] }}</ref>\n\n====Ten Point Program====\nIn 1974, the PLO adopted the ''[[PLO's Phased Plan|Ten Point Program]]'', which called for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian democratic, binational state (a [[one state solution]]). It also called for the establishment of Palestinian rule on \"any part\" of its liberated territory, as a step towards \"completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.\" While this was not seen by Israel as a significant moderation of PLO policy, the phrasing was extremely controversial within the PLO itself, where it was widely regarded as a move towards a [[two-state solution]]. The adoption of the program, under pressure from Arafat's [[Fatah]] faction and some minor groups (e.g. [[DFLP]], [[al-Sa'iqa]]) led many hard-line groups to break away from the Arafat and the mainstream PLO members, forming the [[Rejectionist Front]]. To some extent, this split is still evident today. Declassified diplomatic documents reveal that in 1974, on the eve of the UN debate that granted the PLO an observer status, some parts of the PLO leadership were considering to proclaim the formation of a Palestinian [[government in exile]] at some point.<ref>[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=169847&dt=2474&dl=1345 Godley (US Embassy in Beirut) to Secretary of State, 7 November 1974].</ref> This plan, however, was not carried out.\n\nAt the [[Rabat summit conference]] in 1974, Jordan and the other members of the [[Arab League]] declared that the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] was the \"sole legitimate representative of the [Arab] Palestinian people\", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.\n\nDuring the 1978 [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David]] negotiations between Israel and Egypt [[Anwar Sadat]] proposed the creation of a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].

Beginning with the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] and culminating in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords|Oslo Peace Accords]] between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace process has laid the framework for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and in Gaza. According to the Oslo Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank. East Jerusalem, which had been annexed by Israel in 1980 was not mentioned in any of the agreements.\n\nFollowing the landmark accords, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) was established to govern those areas from which Israel was to pull out. The PNA was granted limited autonomy over a non-contiguous area, though it does govern most Palestinian population centers.\n\nThe process stalled with the collapse of the [[Camp David 2000 Summit between Palestinians and Israel]], after which the [[second Intifada]] broke out.\n\nIsrael ceased acting in cooperation with the PNA. In the shadow of the rising death toll from the violence, the [[United States]] initiated the [[Road Map for Peace]] (published on June 24, 2002), which was intended to end the Intifada by disarming the Palestinian terror groups and creating an independent Palestinian state. The Road Map has stalled awaiting the implementation of the step required by the first phase of that plan with then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating within weeks of the release of the final text that a settlement freeze, one of Israel's main requirements, would be \"impossible\" because of the need for settlers to build new houses and start families.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3020335.stm|title=Powell visit highlights problems, 12/05/2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> It remains stalled because of Israel's continuing refusal to comply with the requirement to freeze settlement expansion and the civil war between [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]], except that on April 27, 2011 it was announced that Hamas and Fatah had reached a reconciliation agreement in a pact which was brokered by Egypt. Hamas, Fatah, and the other Palestinian political factions signed the reconciliation agreement in the official signing ceremony of that agreement which took place on May 4, 2011.\n\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip as part of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]].\n\nIn 2008, U.S.-brokered negotiations were ongoing between Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.\n\nIn 2011, [[Al Jazeera]] published thousands of classified documents that it had received from sources close to negotiators in the 2008 negotiation talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The documents, dubbed the [[Palestine Papers]], showed that in private the Palestinians had made major concessions on issues that had scuttled previous negotiations. Olmert also presented his ideas for the borders for a Palestinian state, dubbed the \"Napkin Map\" because of Abbas having to sketch the map on a napkin because Olmert refused to allow Abbas to keep a copy for further consideration. Olmert's proposal largely followed the route of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], and placed all of the Israeli settlement blocs and East Jerusalem Jewish neighbourhoods under Israeli sovereignty. Israel would retain around 10% of the West Bank and in return the Palestinians would receive around 5% of Israeli territory adjacent to the southern West Bank and lands adjacent to the Gaza Strip.\n\n===Direct talks in 2010===\n{{main|Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010}}\nIn early September 2010 the first peace talks since the Gaza war in 2009 were held in Washington DC between Israeli prime-minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The pace of the talks were assessed by the US as \"break through\". However, on 25 September Netanyahu did not renew a 10-month moratorium on settlement construction in the [[West Bank]], which brought him severe criticism from the United States, Europe and the United Nations. Abbas stated that Netanyahu could not be trusted as a 'true' peace negotiator if the freeze was not extended.

This was the basis for the [[Oslo accords]],<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/22602.htm ]</ref> and it is, as a matter of official policy, favoured by the U.S.<ref>[http://geneva.usmission.gov/press2004/0916Roadmap.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010191526/http://geneva.usmission.gov/press2004/0916Roadmap.htm |date=October 10, 2008}}</ref> The status of Israel within the [[1949 Armistice lines]] has not been the subject of international negotiations. Some members of the PLO recognize Israel's right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed.<ref name=HamasC/> Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible with the current PLO as a basis, and needs to be delayed.\n\nIsrael declares that its security demands that a \"Palestinian entity\" would not have all attributes of a state, at least initially, so that in case things go wrong, Israel would not have to face a dangerous and nearby enemy. Israel may be therefore said to agree (as of now) not to a complete and independent Palestinian state, but rather to a self-administering entity, with partial but not full sovereignty over its borders and its citizens.\n\nThe central Palestinian position is that they have already compromised greatly by accepting a state covering only the areas of the West Bank and Gaza. These areas are significantly less territory than allocated to the Arab state in UN [[UN General Assembly Resolution 181|Resolution 181]]. They feel that it is unacceptable for an agreement to impose additional restrictions (such as level of militarization, see below) which, they declare, makes a viable state impossible. In particular, they are angered by significant increases in the population of Israeli settlements and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the interim period of the Oslo accords. Palestinians claim that they have already waited long enough, and that Israel's interests do not justify depriving their state of those rights that they consider important. The Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a territorially disjointed state.\n\n==Plans for a solution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:We-map.png|thumb|300 px|The West Bank]][[File:Gz-map2.png|thumb|250 px|The Gaza Strip]]\nThere are several plans for a possible Palestinian state. Each one has many variations. Some of the more prominent plans include:\n*Creation of a Palestinian state out of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], with its capital in [[East Jerusalem]]. This would make the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice lines]], perhaps with minor changes, into permanent ''[[de jure]]'' borders. This long-extant idea forms the basis of a [[Arab Peace Initiative|peace plan]] put forward by [[Saudi Arabia]] in March 2002, which was accepted by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and all other members of the [[Arab League]]. This plan promised, in exchange for withdrawal, complete recognition of and full diplomatic relations with Israel by the Arab world. Israel claims its security would be threatened by (essentially) complete withdrawal as it would return Israel to its pre-1967 10-mile [[strategic depth]]. The plan spoke only of a \"just settlement of the refugee problem\", but insistence on a [[Palestinian right of return]] to the pre-1967 territory of Israel could result in two Arab states, one of them (pre-1967 Israel) with a significant Jewish minority, and another (the West Bank and Gaza) without Jews.\n* Other, more limited, plans for a Palestinian state have also been put forward, with parts of Gaza and the West Bank which have been settled by Israelis or are of particular strategic importance remaining in Israeli hands. Areas that are currently part of Israel could be allocated to the Palestinian state in compensation. The status of Jerusalem is particularly contentious.\n*A plan proposed by former Israeli tourism minister MK [[Binyamin Elon]] and popular with the Israeli right wing advocates the expansion of Israel up to the [[Jordan River]] and the \"recognition and development of Jordan as the Palestinian State\".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The legitimacy for this plan leans on the fact that a large share of the Jordanian population has Palestinian roots, including [[List of kings of Jordan|King]] [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]'s wife, [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania]], as well as the fact that the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]] is composed of lands that until 1921 were part of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus was claimed by at least some Zionists (such as [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and his [[Irgun|Etzel]]) as part of the \"Jewish national home\" of the Balfour Declaration. Palestinian residents of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and the [[West Bank]] would become citizens of Jordan and many would be settled in other countries. Elon claims this would be part of the [[population exchange]] initiated by the exodus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/263 |title=Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries :: Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Meforum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> of Jews from Arab states to Israel in the 1950s. See [[Elon Peace Plan]]. A September 2004 poll conducted by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies reported that 46% of Israelis support transferring the Arab population out of the territories and that 60% of respondents said that they were in favor of encouraging Israeli Arabs to leave the country.<ref name=\"elon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20051127105105/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=140196&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0 More Israeli Jews favor transfer of Palestinians, Israeli Arabs - poll finds] Ha'aretz</ref>\n*[[RAND]] has proposed a solution entitled \"The Arc\" in which the West Bank is joined with Gaza in an infrastructural arc. The development plan includes recommendations from low level civic planning to banking reform and currency reform.<ref name=\"randarc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9119/index1.html|title=The Arc: A Formal Structure for a Palestinian State|year=2005|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref>\n*Another plan which has gained some support is one where the [[Gaza Strip]] is given independence as a Palestinian enclave, with parts of the [[West Bank]] split between Israel and Jordan respectively. The Jerusalem problem may be addressed by administration by a third party such as the [[United Nations]] as put forward in their initial partition plan.\n\nSeveral plans have been proposed for a Palestinian state to incorporate all of the former British mandate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (pre-1967 territory of Israel, the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]]). Some possible configurations include:\n*A secular Arab state (as described in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] before the cancellation of the relevant clauses in 1998). Accordingly, only those \"Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians\", which excludes at least 90% of the Jewish population of Israel.\n*A strictly Islamic state (advocated by [[Hamas]] and the Islamic Movement). This arrangement would face objection from the Jewish population as well as secular [[Muslims]], and non-Muslim Palestinians.\n*A [[federation]] (likely [[consociationalism|consociational]]) of separate Jewish and Arab areas (some Israelis and [[Palestinians]]). It is not clear how this arrangement would distribute natural resources and maintain security.\n*A single, [[Binational solution|bi-national state]] (advocated by various Israeli and Palestinian groups). Fears exist that the Palestinians may come to outnumber the Jews after a few years. Many Israelis are loath to live in a state where Jews no longer are the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Such a configuration exists in Lebanon and Bosnia, but failed in Yugoslavia. Strong nationalist sentiment among many Israelis and Palestinians would be an obstacle to this arrangement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} After what he perceived as the failure of the Oslo Process and the two-state solution, Palestinian-American professor [[Edward Said]] became a vocal advocate of this plan. <!--does this belong here?-->\n*A [[United Arab Kingdom]] plan which returns Palestine to nominal Jordanian control under the supervision of a Hashemite monarch. This idea was first proposed by the late [[King Hussein]]. In October 2007, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] stated that the Palestinian independence must be achieved before Jordan will entertain expanding its role in Palestine beyond religious sites. This plan is buttressed by a Jordanian infrastructure, which is vastly superior to the 1948\u20131967 area with particular attention paid to tourism, health care, and education. A Palestinian state would rely heavily on tourism, which Jordan would assist with considerable experience and established departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Parties which recognise a Palestinian entity separate from Israel==\n{{Main|International recognition of the State of Palestine}}\n* There are conflicting reports about the number of countries that extended their recognition to the proclaimed State of Palestine. In Annex 2 of the [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000827/082711eo.pdf Request for the Admission of the State of Palestine to UNESCO] from 12 May 1982, several Arab and African countries provided a list of 92 countries allegedly having extended such recognition. In the same document (Corrigendum 1), it is requested that Austria be removed from the list. Namibia is listed even though it was not independent at the time. The list also includes a considerable number of states that ceased to exist during the 1990s, most notably the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Democratic Yemen]], [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (today: [[Cambodia]]) and [[Zaire]] (today: [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).

In 1947, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was voted. This triggered the [[1947\u20131949 Palestine war]] and led, in 1948, to the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] on a part of Mandate Palestine as the Mandate came to an end. Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state. In 1969, for example, the PLO proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. This proposal was rejected by Israel, as it would have amounted to the disbanding of the state of Israel. The basis of the current proposals is for a [[two-state solution]] on either a portion of or the entirety of the [[Palestinian territories]]\u2014the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], which have been [[military occupation|occupied]] by Israel since 1967.\n\n==Background==\n===Ottoman era===\nAt the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following [[World War I]], the victorious European states divided many of its component regions into newly created states under [[League of Nations mandate]]s according to deals that had been struck with other interested parties.<ref>Boundaries Delimitation: Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Yitzhak Gil-Har, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 68-81: \"Palestine and Transjordan emerged as states; This was in consequence of British War commitments to its allies during the First World War.</ref> In the Middle East, [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] (including the Ottoman autonomous Christian Lebanon and the surrounding areas that became the Republic of Lebanon) came under French control, while [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] were allotted to the British.\n\nMost of these states achieved independence during the following three decades without great difficulty, though in some regimes, the colonial legacy continued through the granting of exclusive rights to market/manufacture oil and maintain troops to defend it.{{citation needed|reason=which regimes?|date=July 2015}} However, the case of Palestine remained problematic.\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] was on the rise after World War II, possibly following the example of European nationalism. [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] beliefs called for the creation of a single, secular state for all Arabs.\n\n===Mandate Period===\n[[File:Proposals for the Mandate of Palestine 1916-19.svg|thumb|Three proposals for the post World War I administration of Palestine:\n{{legend|border=darkred solid|white|\"International Administration\" proposed in the 1916 [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]]}}<br />\n{{legend|border=blue dashed 2px |white|1919 [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] proposal at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]}}<br />\n{{legend|border=blue solid|white|Final borders of the 1923\u201348 [[Mandatory Palestine]]}}]]\n{{See also|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandatory Palestine}}\nIn 1917 the British Government issued the [[Balfour Declaration]] which declared British support for the creation in Palestine of a \"[[national home for the Jewish people]]\". The declaration was enthusiastically received by many Jews worldwide, but was opposed by Palestinian and Arab leaders, who later claimed that the objective was a breach of promises made to the [[Sharif of Mecca]] in 1915, in exchange for Arab help fighting the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]].\n\nMany different proposals have been made and continue to be made to resolve the dilemma of the competing objectives, including an Arab state, with or without a significant Jewish population, a Jewish state, with or without a significant Arab population, a [[Isratine|single bi-national state]], with or without some degree of cantonization, two states, one bi-national and one Arab, with or without some form of federation, and two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with or without some form of federation.\n\nAt the same times, many Arab leaders maintained that Palestine should join a larger Arab state covering the imprecise region of the [[Levant]]. These hopes were expressed in the [[Faisal\u2013Weizmann Agreement]], which was signed by soon-to-be Iraqi ruler [[Faisal I]] and the Zionist leader [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Despite this, the promise of a Pan-Arab state including Palestine were dashed as [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]] declared independence from their European rulers, while western Palestine festered in the developing Arab-Jewish conflict.\n\nIn light of these developments, Arabs began calling for both their own state in the British Mandate of Palestine and an end to the British support of the [[Jewish homeland]]'s creation and to [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]]. The movement gained steam through the 1920s and 1930s as Jewish immigration picked up. Under pressure from the arising nationalist movement, the British enforced the White Papers, a series of laws greatly restricting Jewish immigration and the sale of lands to Jews. The laws, passed in [[Churchill White Paper, 1922|1922]], 1930, and [[White Paper of 1939|1939]], varied in severity, but all attempted to find a balance between British sympathies with the Jews and the Arabs.\n\n====McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence (1915\u201316)====\n{{See also|McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence}}\n[[File:Ottoman Syria 1918.png|thumb|right|250px|Administrative units in the [[Levant]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]], until c. 1918]]\nIn the early years of [[World War I]], negotiations took place between the [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|British High Commissioner]] in Egypt [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] and [[Sharif of Mecca]] [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husayn bin Ali]] for an alliance of sorts between the Allies and the Arabs in the Near East against the Ottomans. On 24 October 1915, McMahon sent to Hussein a note which the Arabs came to regard as their \"Declaration of Independence\". In [[McMahon letters|McMahon's letter]], part of the [[McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence]], McMahon declared Britain's willingness to recognise the independence of the Arabs, both in the Levant and the Hejaz, subject to certain exemptions. It stated on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that:\n<blockquote>\nThe two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded.<br /><br />\nWith the above modification, and without prejudice of our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits.<br /><br />\nAs for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:\n# Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Henry |last1=McMahon |author1-link=Henry McMahon (diplomat) |title=The Hussein-MacMahon Correspondence: Letter No. 4 |date=24 October 1915 |accessdate=June 16, 2014 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/hussmac1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020728145031/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/hussmac1.html |archive-date=28 July 2002 |url-status=live |publisher=The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe exemptions from Arab control of certain areas set out in the McMahon note were to seriously complicate the problems of peace in the Near East. At the time, the Arab portions of the Ottoman Empire were divided into administrative units called ''vilayets'' and ''sanjaks''. Palestine was divided into the ''sanjuks'' of Acre and Nablus, both of which were a part of the [[vilayet of Beirut]], and an independent ''sanjak'' of Jerusalem. The areas exempted from Arab control by the McMahon note included \"Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.\" Between 1916\u201320, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the [[Churchill White Paper]] they argued instead that \"Damascus\" meant the ''vilayet'' and not the city of Damascus, and accordingly virtually all of Palestine was excluded from Arab control. The British entered into the secret [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] on 16 May 1916 and the commitment of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], for example, on that understanding.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe Arabs, however, insisted at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] at the end of the war that \"Damascus\" meant the city of Damascus&nbsp;\u2013 which left Palestine in their hands.<ref>[[Howard Sachar|Sachar, Howard Morley]] (1977).

The Mandate was administered as two territories: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]],<ref name=Whiteman>See Marjorie M.

The boundaries under the Mandate also did not follow those sought by the Jewish community, which sought the inclusion of the east bank of the Jordan into the Palestinian territory, to which the objective of the Mandate for a [[homeland for the Jewish people]] would apply. It was made clear from before the commencement of the Mandate, and a clause to that effect was inserted in the Mandate, that the objective set out in the Mandate would not apply to Transjordan following the passing of the [[Transjordan memorandum]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Transjordan was destined for early independence. The objective of the Mandate was to apply only to territory west of the Jordan, which was commonly referred to as Palestine by the British administration, and as [[Eretz Israel]] by the [[Hebrew]]-speaking Jewish population.\n\n====Peel Commission (1936\u201337)====\n{{Main|Peel Commission}}\n[[File:Peelmap-a.png|right|180px|thumb|Peel Commission, partition plan A, November 1937]]\nDuring the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine]] the British government formed the [[Peel Commission]], which recommended the formation of a Jewish and an Arab state.

The Arab area was to be joined to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].

The Zionist Congress rejected the proposal, while allowing the leadership to continue negotiating with the British.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aaron S.

It all came to nothing, as the British government shelved the proposal altogether by the middle of 1938.\n\nIn February 1939, the [[St. James Conference]] convened in London, but the Arab delegation refused to formally meet with its Jewish counterpart or to recognize them. The Conference ended on March 17, 1939 without making any progress. On May 17, 1939, the British government issued the [[White Paper of 1939]], in which the idea of partitioning the Mandate was abandoned in favor of Jews and Arabs sharing one government and put strict quotas on further Jewish immigration. Because of impending [[World War II]] and the opposition from all sides, the plan was dropped.\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) gave a boost to the Jewish nationalism, as the [[Holocaust]] reaffirmed their call for a Jewish homeland. At the same time, many Arab leaders had even supported [[Nazi Germany]], a fact which could not play well with the British. As a result, Britain pooled its energy into winning over Arab opinions by abandoning the Balfour Declaration and the terms of the League of Nations mandate which had been entrusted to it in order to create a \"Jewish National Home\". Britain did this by issuing the 1939 white paper which officially allowed a further 75,000 Jews to move over five years (10,000 a year plus an additional 25,000) which was to be followed by Arab majority independence. The British would later claim that that quota had already been fulfilled by those who had entered without its approval.\n\n====The Arab League and the Arab Higher Committee (1945)====\nThe framers of the Arab League sought to include the Palestinian Arabs within the framework of the League from its inception.<ref>Geddes, 1991, p. 208.</ref> An annex to the League Pact declared:<ref>{{cite web|author=Head of states of the founding members |title=Pact of the League of Arab States, March 22, 1945 |work=[[The Avalon Project]] |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arableag.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991007232840/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/arableag.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 October 1999 |accessdate=9 July 2008 }}</ref>\n<blockquote>Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her.

PART I: Future constitution and government of Palestine: A. Clause 3. provided as follows:- ''Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, set forth in part III of this plan, shall come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948''. The resolution noted Britain's planned termination of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] and recommended the partition of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] into two states, one [[Arab]] and one [[Jewish]], with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area being under special international protection, administered by the United Nations.

The resolution sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims to the Mandate territory of two competing nationalist movements, [[Zionism]] (Jewish nationalism) and Arab nationalism, as well as to resolve the plight of Jews displaced as a result of the [[Holocaust]].

Rifai asked when the U.S. was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the U.S. to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the U.S. accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the U.S. did in fact recognize the union.

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However, the Plan also provided that 'Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip', as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian/Gaza border, and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. <br />Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace, and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. ''[Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings.]'' Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter parts of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone, they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for, ''inter alia'', electricity, currency, telephone networks, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry, through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000, aside from a limited number of exceptions, Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry.<br />It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.|doi=10.1007/978-90-6704-811-8_14|series=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=International Law and the Classification of Conflicts|editor=Elizabeth Wilmshurst|first=Iain|last=Scobbie|authorlink=Iain Scobbie|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|isbn=9780199657759|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM90Xp03uuEC&pg=PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Prefiguring Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships|first=Michelle|last= Gawerc|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2012|isbn=9780739166109|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hka8FZ4UdWUC&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote=While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace.

According to Goldberg, the U.S. believed in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles, there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.<ref>Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, p. 981, Document 501.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. President's Special Assistant, [[Walt Rostow]], told Israeli ambassador [[Avraham Harman|Harmon]] that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the U.S. expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarisation arrangements rather than toward major changes in the armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration, but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including \"sovereignty\". Rostow said the U.S. government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.<ref>Foreign relations of the United States, 1964\u20131968, Volume XVIII Arab-Israeli Dispute, p. 996, Document 505.</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of fighting in Jordan in September 1970 between the Jordanian army and Palestinian guerilla, the US government began considering the creation of a separate Palestinian political entity. However, a Palestinian state was the least considered alternative. A State Department memo of 1970 stated in that regard:\n<blockquote>\nsuch a state would presumably have to be limited to the West Bank and Gaza, it would probably not be economically viable without the injection of large-scale outside financial assistance. Its political viability is also doubtful, since a large number of Palestinians would remain outside its borders and it would tend to be dominated by a larger and more powerful Israel.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v23/d182 Paper Prepared by the National Security Council Staff, November 13, 1970, ''Foreign Relations of the United States 1969-1976'', vol. 23]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n====PLO and the binational state solution====\nBefore the Six-Day War, the movement for an independent Palestine received a boost in 1964 when the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] was established. Its goal, as stated in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] was to create a Palestinian state in the whole British Mandate, a statement which nullified Israel's [[right to exist]]. The PLO would become the leading force in the Palestinian national movement politically, and its leader, Egyptian-born [[Yassir Arafat]], would become regarded as the leader of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn 1969, the Fatah movement, accepting as a ''fait accompli'' the presence in Palestine of a large number of Jews, declared that it was not fighting against Jews, but against Israel as a racist and theocratic entity. The fifth national council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in February 1969 passed a resolution confirming that the PLO's objective was \"to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews\". The PLO was not successful in building support for the binational solution within Israeli society, however, which lay the groundwork for an eventual re-scoping of the PLO's aim toward partition into two states.<ref>[http://mondediplo.com/2010/10/03binationalism A history of conflict between opposing ideals (Le Monde Diplomatique, Oct. 2010)]</ref>\n\n====Rift between Jordan and Palestinian leadership (1970)====\nAfter the events of [[Black September in Jordan]], the rift between the Palestinian leadership and the Kingdom of Jordan continued to widen. The Arab League affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to ''self-determination'' and called on all the Arab states, including Jordan, to undertake to defend Palestinian national unity and not to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs. The Arab League also 'affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated.'

It also called for the establishment of Palestinian rule on \"any part\" of its liberated territory, as a step towards \"completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.\" While this was not seen by Israel as a significant moderation of PLO policy, the phrasing was extremely controversial within the PLO itself, where it was widely regarded as a move towards a [[two-state solution]]. The adoption of the program, under pressure from Arafat's [[Fatah]] faction and some minor groups (e.g. [[DFLP]], [[al-Sa'iqa]]) led many hard-line groups to break away from the Arafat and the mainstream PLO members, forming the [[Rejectionist Front]]. To some extent, this split is still evident today. Declassified diplomatic documents reveal that in 1974, on the eve of the UN debate that granted the PLO an observer status, some parts of the PLO leadership were considering to proclaim the formation of a Palestinian [[government in exile]] at some point.<ref>[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=169847&dt=2474&dl=1345 Godley (US Embassy in Beirut) to Secretary of State, 7 November 1974].</ref> This plan, however, was not carried out.\n\nAt the [[Rabat summit conference]] in 1974, Jordan and the other members of the [[Arab League]] declared that the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] was the \"sole legitimate representative of the [Arab] Palestinian people\", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.\n\nDuring the 1978 [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David]] negotiations between Israel and Egypt [[Anwar Sadat]] proposed the creation of a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].

Beginning with the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] and culminating in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords|Oslo Peace Accords]] between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace process has laid the framework for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and in Gaza. According to the Oslo Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank. East Jerusalem, which had been annexed by Israel in 1980 was not mentioned in any of the agreements.\n\nFollowing the landmark accords, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) was established to govern those areas from which Israel was to pull out. The PNA was granted limited autonomy over a non-contiguous area, though it does govern most Palestinian population centers.\n\nThe process stalled with the collapse of the [[Camp David 2000 Summit between Palestinians and Israel]], after which the [[second Intifada]] broke out.\n\nIsrael ceased acting in cooperation with the PNA. In the shadow of the rising death toll from the violence, the [[United States]] initiated the [[Road Map for Peace]] (published on June 24, 2002), which was intended to end the Intifada by disarming the Palestinian terror groups and creating an independent Palestinian state. The Road Map has stalled awaiting the implementation of the step required by the first phase of that plan with then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating within weeks of the release of the final text that a settlement freeze, one of Israel's main requirements, would be \"impossible\" because of the need for settlers to build new houses and start families.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3020335.stm|title=Powell visit highlights problems, 12/05/2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> It remains stalled because of Israel's continuing refusal to comply with the requirement to freeze settlement expansion and the civil war between [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]], except that on April 27, 2011 it was announced that Hamas and Fatah had reached a reconciliation agreement in a pact which was brokered by Egypt. Hamas, Fatah, and the other Palestinian political factions signed the reconciliation agreement in the official signing ceremony of that agreement which took place on May 4, 2011.\n\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip as part of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]].\n\nIn 2008, U.S.-brokered negotiations were ongoing between Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.\n\nIn 2011, [[Al Jazeera]] published thousands of classified documents that it had received from sources close to negotiators in the 2008 negotiation talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The documents, dubbed the [[Palestine Papers]], showed that in private the Palestinians had made major concessions on issues that had scuttled previous negotiations. Olmert also presented his ideas for the borders for a Palestinian state, dubbed the \"Napkin Map\" because of Abbas having to sketch the map on a napkin because Olmert refused to allow Abbas to keep a copy for further consideration. Olmert's proposal largely followed the route of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], and placed all of the Israeli settlement blocs and East Jerusalem Jewish neighbourhoods under Israeli sovereignty. Israel would retain around 10% of the West Bank and in return the Palestinians would receive around 5% of Israeli territory adjacent to the southern West Bank and lands adjacent to the Gaza Strip.\n\n===Direct talks in 2010===\n{{main|Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010}}\nIn early September 2010 the first peace talks since the Gaza war in 2009 were held in Washington DC between Israeli prime-minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The pace of the talks were assessed by the US as \"break through\". However, on 25 September Netanyahu did not renew a 10-month moratorium on settlement construction in the [[West Bank]], which brought him severe criticism from the United States, Europe and the United Nations. Abbas stated that Netanyahu could not be trusted as a 'true' peace negotiator if the freeze was not extended.

Some members of the PLO recognize Israel's right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed.<ref name=HamasC/> Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible with the current PLO as a basis, and needs to be delayed.\n\nIsrael declares that its security demands that a \"Palestinian entity\" would not have all attributes of a state, at least initially, so that in case things go wrong, Israel would not have to face a dangerous and nearby enemy. Israel may be therefore said to agree (as of now) not to a complete and independent Palestinian state, but rather to a self-administering entity, with partial but not full sovereignty over its borders and its citizens.\n\nThe central Palestinian position is that they have already compromised greatly by accepting a state covering only the areas of the West Bank and Gaza. These areas are significantly less territory than allocated to the Arab state in UN [[UN General Assembly Resolution 181|Resolution 181]]. They feel that it is unacceptable for an agreement to impose additional restrictions (such as level of militarization, see below) which, they declare, makes a viable state impossible. In particular, they are angered by significant increases in the population of Israeli settlements and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the interim period of the Oslo accords. Palestinians claim that they have already waited long enough, and that Israel's interests do not justify depriving their state of those rights that they consider important. The Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a territorially disjointed state.\n\n==Plans for a solution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:We-map.png|thumb|300 px|The West Bank]][[File:Gz-map2.png|thumb|250 px|The Gaza Strip]]\nThere are several plans for a possible Palestinian state. Each one has many variations. Some of the more prominent plans include:\n*Creation of a Palestinian state out of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], with its capital in [[East Jerusalem]]. This would make the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice lines]], perhaps with minor changes, into permanent ''[[de jure]]'' borders. This long-extant idea forms the basis of a [[Arab Peace Initiative|peace plan]] put forward by [[Saudi Arabia]] in March 2002, which was accepted by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and all other members of the [[Arab League]]. This plan promised, in exchange for withdrawal, complete recognition of and full diplomatic relations with Israel by the Arab world. Israel claims its security would be threatened by (essentially) complete withdrawal as it would return Israel to its pre-1967 10-mile [[strategic depth]]. The plan spoke only of a \"just settlement of the refugee problem\", but insistence on a [[Palestinian right of return]] to the pre-1967 territory of Israel could result in two Arab states, one of them (pre-1967 Israel) with a significant Jewish minority, and another (the West Bank and Gaza) without Jews.\n* Other, more limited, plans for a Palestinian state have also been put forward, with parts of Gaza and the West Bank which have been settled by Israelis or are of particular strategic importance remaining in Israeli hands. Areas that are currently part of Israel could be allocated to the Palestinian state in compensation. The status of Jerusalem is particularly contentious.\n*A plan proposed by former Israeli tourism minister MK [[Binyamin Elon]] and popular with the Israeli right wing advocates the expansion of Israel up to the [[Jordan River]] and the \"recognition and development of Jordan as the Palestinian State\".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The legitimacy for this plan leans on the fact that a large share of the Jordanian population has Palestinian roots, including [[List of kings of Jordan|King]] [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]'s wife, [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania]], as well as the fact that the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]] is composed of lands that until 1921 were part of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus was claimed by at least some Zionists (such as [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and his [[Irgun|Etzel]]) as part of the \"Jewish national home\" of the Balfour Declaration. Palestinian residents of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and the [[West Bank]] would become citizens of Jordan and many would be settled in other countries. Elon claims this would be part of the [[population exchange]] initiated by the exodus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/263 |title=Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries :: Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Meforum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> of Jews from Arab states to Israel in the 1950s. See [[Elon Peace Plan]]. A September 2004 poll conducted by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies reported that 46% of Israelis support transferring the Arab population out of the territories and that 60% of respondents said that they were in favor of encouraging Israeli Arabs to leave the country.<ref name=\"elon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20051127105105/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=140196&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0 More Israeli Jews favor transfer of Palestinians, Israeli Arabs - poll finds] Ha'aretz</ref>\n*[[RAND]] has proposed a solution entitled \"The Arc\" in which the West Bank is joined with Gaza in an infrastructural arc. The development plan includes recommendations from low level civic planning to banking reform and currency reform.<ref name=\"randarc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9119/index1.html|title=The Arc: A Formal Structure for a Palestinian State|year=2005|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref>\n*Another plan which has gained some support is one where the [[Gaza Strip]] is given independence as a Palestinian enclave, with parts of the [[West Bank]] split between Israel and Jordan respectively. The Jerusalem problem may be addressed by administration by a third party such as the [[United Nations]] as put forward in their initial partition plan.\n\nSeveral plans have been proposed for a Palestinian state to incorporate all of the former British mandate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (pre-1967 territory of Israel, the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]]). Some possible configurations include:\n*A secular Arab state (as described in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] before the cancellation of the relevant clauses in 1998). Accordingly, only those \"Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians\", which excludes at least 90% of the Jewish population of Israel.\n*A strictly Islamic state (advocated by [[Hamas]] and the Islamic Movement). This arrangement would face objection from the Jewish population as well as secular [[Muslims]], and non-Muslim Palestinians.\n*A [[federation]] (likely [[consociationalism|consociational]]) of separate Jewish and Arab areas (some Israelis and [[Palestinians]]). It is not clear how this arrangement would distribute natural resources and maintain security.\n*A single, [[Binational solution|bi-national state]] (advocated by various Israeli and Palestinian groups). Fears exist that the Palestinians may come to outnumber the Jews after a few years. Many Israelis are loath to live in a state where Jews no longer are the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Such a configuration exists in Lebanon and Bosnia, but failed in Yugoslavia. Strong nationalist sentiment among many Israelis and Palestinians would be an obstacle to this arrangement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} After what he perceived as the failure of the Oslo Process and the two-state solution, Palestinian-American professor [[Edward Said]] became a vocal advocate of this plan. <!--does this belong here?-->\n*A [[United Arab Kingdom]] plan which returns Palestine to nominal Jordanian control under the supervision of a Hashemite monarch. This idea was first proposed by the late [[King Hussein]]. In October 2007, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] stated that the Palestinian independence must be achieved before Jordan will entertain expanding its role in Palestine beyond religious sites. This plan is buttressed by a Jordanian infrastructure, which is vastly superior to the 1948\u20131967 area with particular attention paid to tourism, health care, and education. A Palestinian state would rely heavily on tourism, which Jordan would assist with considerable experience and established departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Parties which recognise a Palestinian entity separate from Israel==\n{{Main|International recognition of the State of Palestine}}\n* There are conflicting reports about the number of countries that extended their recognition to the proclaimed State of Palestine.

In the same document (Corrigendum 1), it is requested that Austria be removed from the list. Namibia is listed even though it was not independent at the time. The list also includes a considerable number of states that ceased to exist during the 1990s, most notably the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Democratic Yemen]], [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (today: [[Cambodia]]) and [[Zaire]] (today: [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).

The AAFC Colts played for three seasons in the AAFC (1947, 1948, and 1949), and when the AAFC folded following the 1949 season, moved to the NFL for a single year (1950) before going bankrupt.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the Colts were one of the NFLs more successful franchises, led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] who set a then-record of 47 consecutive games with a touchdown pass. The Colts advanced to the [[NFL Championship]] twice (1958 & 1959) and [[Super Bowl]] twice (1969 & 1971), winning all except [[Super Bowl III]] in 1969.

The BCFD operates out of 37 fire stations located throughout the city and has a long history and sets of traditions in its various houses and divisions.\n\n===State government===\n{{out of date|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Baltimore City Delegation}}\n\nSince the legislative [[redistricting]] in 2002, Baltimore has had six legislative districts located entirely within its boundaries, giving the city six seats in the 47-member [[Maryland Senate]] and 18 in the 141-member [[Maryland House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"Delegation\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/gacobcit.html| title=General Assembly Members by County: Baltimore City| work=Maryland Manual On-Line| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=January 27, 2011| access-date=March 30, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331203017/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/gacobcit.html| archive-date= March 31, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"2002 Plan\">{{cite web| url=http://planning.maryland.gov/PDF/OurProducts/Redistrict/2002ld_courtappeals_62102_MD_map_web.pdf| title=2002 Legislative District Plan| publisher=Maryland Department of Planning| access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref> During the previous 10-year period, Baltimore had four legislative districts within the city limits, but four others overlapped the Baltimore County line.<ref name=\"1992 Plan\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/map/html/bcm.html| title=Legislative Election Districts 1992\u20132000| work=Maryland Manual On-Line| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=June 17, 2004| access-date=March 31, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331203617/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/map/html/bcm.html| archive-date= March 31, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> {{as of|2011|January|}}, all of Baltimore's state senators and delegates were Democrats.<ref name=\"Delegation\" /> Approval of the next redistricting plan is expected to become effective in time for Maryland's 2012 congressional primary election on February 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://planning.maryland.gov/OurProducts/redistrictingFAQ.shtml| title=Congressional and Legislative Redistricting| publisher=Maryland Department of Planning| access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====State agencies====\n{{See also|List of state agencies headquartered in Baltimore}}\n\n===Federal government===\n{{Further|Maryland's 2nd congressional district|Maryland's 3rd congressional district|Maryland's 7th congressional district}}\n{{See also|United States Senate election in Maryland, 2006}}\nThree of the state's eight [[congressional district]]s include portions of Baltimore: the [[Maryland's 2nd congressional district|2nd]], represented by [[Dutch Ruppersberger]]; the [[Maryland's 3rd congressional district|3rd]], represented by [[John Sarbanes]]; and the [[Maryland's 7th congressional district|7th]], represented by [[Elijah Cummings]].

In 2015, 30.7 percent of Baltimore households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 28.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

The first [[limited-access highway]] serving Baltimore was the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway]], which opened in stages between 1950 and 1954. Maintenance of it is split: the half closest to Baltimore is maintained by the state of Maryland, and the half closest to Washington by the [[National Park Service]]. Trucks are only permitted to use the northern part of the parkway. Trucks (tractor-trailers) continued to use [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) until [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] (I-95) between Baltimore and Washington opened in 1971.\n\nThe Interstate highways serving Baltimore are [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]], I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95, [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|I-395]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] (the Baltimore Beltway), [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|I-795]] (the Northwest Expressway), [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and [[Interstate 97|I-97]]. The city's mainline Interstate highways\u2014I-95, I-83, and I-70\u2014do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of [[highway revolts|freeway revolts]] in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by [[Barbara Mikulski]], a former [[United States senator]] for Maryland, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] (opened in 1985 and serving I-95) and the two-bore [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel|Harbor Tunnel]] (opened in 1957 and serving I-895).

Running from the downtown toward the northwest (NNW), it was built through a natural corridor, which meant that no residents or housing were directly affected. A planned section from what is now its southern terminus to I-95 was abandoned. Its route through parkland received criticism.\n\nPlanning for the Baltimore Beltway antedates the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The first portion completed was a small strip connecting the two sections of I-83, the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway and the Jones Falls Expressway.\n\nThe only [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in the city are US 1, which bypasses downtown, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]], which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|Interstate 170]]. State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 295]], which carries the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway.\n\nThe Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems.<ref name=bcdot>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation.aspx| title=Home| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and [[traffic camera]]s.<ref name=bcdot2>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/VehicleTowing.aspx| title=Vehicle Towing| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=bcdot3>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| title=Traffic Cameras| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation|access-date=January 21, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127061625/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| archive-date= January 27, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore.

There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The [[Jones Falls Trail]] currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long term plans call for it to extend to the [[Mount Washington (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Mount Washington Light Rail Stop]], and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the [[East Coast Greenway]] through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets.

In 2015, 30.7 percent of Baltimore households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 28.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

The first [[limited-access highway]] serving Baltimore was the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway]], which opened in stages between 1950 and 1954. Maintenance of it is split: the half closest to Baltimore is maintained by the state of Maryland, and the half closest to Washington by the [[National Park Service]]. Trucks are only permitted to use the northern part of the parkway. Trucks (tractor-trailers) continued to use [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) until [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] (I-95) between Baltimore and Washington opened in 1971.\n\nThe Interstate highways serving Baltimore are [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]], I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95, [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|I-395]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] (the Baltimore Beltway), [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|I-795]] (the Northwest Expressway), [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and [[Interstate 97|I-97]]. The city's mainline Interstate highways\u2014I-95, I-83, and I-70\u2014do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of [[highway revolts|freeway revolts]] in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by [[Barbara Mikulski]], a former [[United States senator]] for Maryland, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] (opened in 1985 and serving I-95) and the two-bore [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel|Harbor Tunnel]] (opened in 1957 and serving I-895). The Baltimore Beltway crosses south of Baltimore Harbor over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore)|Francis Scott Key Bridge]].\n\n[[File:2019-07-15 13 34 07 View south along Interstate 395 (Cal Ripken Way) at its junction with Interstate 95 from the overpass for the ramp from Interstate 395 southbound to Interstate 95 northbound in Baltimore City, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-95 from the ramp from I-395 to I-95 northbound in Baltimore]]\nThe first interstate highway built in Baltimore was I-83, called the Jones Falls Expressway (first portion built in the early 1960s). Running from the downtown toward the northwest (NNW), it was built through a natural corridor, which meant that no residents or housing were directly affected. A planned section from what is now its southern terminus to I-95 was abandoned. Its route through parkland received criticism.\n\nPlanning for the Baltimore Beltway antedates the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The first portion completed was a small strip connecting the two sections of I-83, the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway and the Jones Falls Expressway.\n\nThe only [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in the city are US 1, which bypasses downtown, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]], which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|Interstate 170]]. State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 295]], which carries the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway.\n\nThe Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems.<ref name=bcdot>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation.aspx| title=Home| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and [[traffic camera]]s.<ref name=bcdot2>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/VehicleTowing.aspx| title=Vehicle Towing| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=bcdot3>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| title=Traffic Cameras| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation|access-date=January 21, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127061625/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| archive-date= January 27, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore.

Additionally, [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail service connects the city's two main intercity rail stations, Camden Station and Penn Station, with Washington, D.C.'s [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] as well as stops in between. The MARC consists of 3 lines; the Brunswick, Camden and Penn.

It is accessible by I-95 and the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway via [[Interstate 195 (Maryland)|Interstate 195]], the [[Baltimore Light Rail]], and Amtrak and MARC Train at [[BWI Rail Station]].\n\nBaltimore is also served by [[Martin State Airport]], a [[general aviation]] facility, to the northeast in Baltimore County. Martin State Airport is linked to [[downtown Baltimore]] by [[Maryland Route 150]] (Eastern Avenue) and by MARC Train at [[Martin State Airport (MARC station)|its own station]].\n\n===Pedestrians and bicycles===\nBaltimore has a comprehensive system of bicycle routes in the city. These routes are not numbered, but are typically denoted with green signs displaying a silhouette of a bicycle upon an outline of the city's border, and denote the distance to destinations, much like bicycle routes in the rest of the state. The roads carrying bicycle routes are also labelled with either bike lanes, sharrows, or Share the Road signs. Many of these routes pass through the downtown area. The network of bicycle lanes in the city continues to expand, with over {{convert|140|mi}} added between 2006 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-01-22/entertainment/bs-b-0122-baltimore-bikes-20140121_1_downtown-baltimore-penny-troutner-nathan-krasnopoler|title=Wheels of Change: Baltimore's bike crusade|work=The Baltimore Sun|author=Andrew Zaleski|date=January 22, 2014|access-date=September 2, 2014}}</ref> Alongside bike lanes, Baltimore has also built [[bike boulevard]]s, starting with Guilford Avenue in 2012.\n\nBaltimore currently has three major trail systems within the city. The [[Gwynns Falls Trail]] runs from the Inner Harbor to the I-70 Park and Ride, passing through [[Gwynns Falls Park]] and possessing numerous branches. There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The [[Jones Falls Trail]] currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long term plans call for it to extend to the [[Mount Washington (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Mount Washington Light Rail Stop]], and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the [[East Coast Greenway]] through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets. A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Baltimore the 14th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Port of Baltimore===\n{{Main|Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore}}\n[[File:Baltimoreharborview.jpg|thumb|left|Eastward view Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Washington Monument, 1849, from Federal Hill 1a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Baltimore harbor in 1849 with the prominent [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]] in the background north of the city]]\n[[File:The Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore)|Francis Scott Key Bridge]] over the Baltimore harbor.]]\nThe port was founded in 1706, preceding the founding of Baltimore. The Maryland colonial legislature made the area near [[Locust Point, Baltimore|Locust Point]] as the [[port of entry]] for the [[tobacco]] trade with England.

The club plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), the highest league in the country.\n\nThe club was established in 1873 and its name originates from the Melbourne suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. The club was a foundation team of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1877 and in 1897 became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which was renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nThe club does not acknowledge any connection to the original St Kilda football club (1858-1864) or the 1872 St Kilda club.\n\n== Victorian Football Association: 1877\u201396 ==\n\nThe St Kilda Football Club itself was not formed until 1873, containing many elements of the previously strong South Yarra club which had disbanded a year earlier, after falling on hard times. South Yarra had won the Challenge Cup in 1866 and many of its better players lined up under the St Kilda banner. In the early stages the club played at an area known as the \"Alpaca Paddock\", next to the present site of the St Kilda Bowling Club near the St Kilda railway station. Alpacas were a kind of llama with long wool which had been imported from South America as a money-raising venture. St Kilda soon boasted a membership of 60 and showed that it would exceed its initial aim of being a junior club. By the end of the first season the Saints were able to force a draw with the top-ranking Carlton and everything looked rosy. There were tough times ahead but St Kilda's uphill battle was not without its humorous moments. Only 12 St Kilda players turned up for a match in  Bendigo and the game against Albert Park started 90 minutes late after the ball burst when it was being inflated prior to the match. Amalgamation with University did not help the cause either, but the club was still one of the original members of the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] when it was formed in 1877. That year St Kilda became only the second team to journey interstate (Melbourne had gone to South Australia a fortnight earlier) and beat Adelaide, then a combined South Australian side.\n\nBy 1879 the club slipped to its lowest ebb and after the side failed to turn up for a game at Essendon, all further matches were abandoned. St Kilda sank into junior ranks for the next six years. The club returned to senior competition in 1886 and struggled to make its mark. A decision was made to amalgamate with nearby Prahran and the St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground, as well as picking up a number of Prahran players. Even at this early point St Kilda had a reputation for being able to lift miraculously on their day and roll the best teams in the competition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Another trademark was the presence of some of the foremost players in football. Alf Smith, a champion rover, was one of the earliest stars, but the hot and cold Saints could never sustain their brilliance for long. Proof of the team's quixotic nature came in the last season it played in the VFA, when several top players missed the Collingwood game because they chose to go to the races instead!\n\nSt Kilda competed as a senior club in the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] from 1877 to 1879, 1881 to 1882 and 1886 to 1896 before competing in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) from 1897 onwards.<ref>[http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-118-0-0-0&sID=54554&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=4834479&sectionID=54554 History of the VFL: 1877 - 2007]</ref>\n\n== Early years in the VFL: 1897\u20131915 ==\nSt Kilda's early years in the Victorian Football League were not successful, finishing last in nine of the first 14 seasons. In 1899, St Kilda scored the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p 45.</ref>\n\nIn 1897, 1898 and 1899 St Kilda finished eighth on the ladder.  In the opening round of 1900 St Kilda and Melbourne tied, but a St Kilda protest over an incorrectly awarded point was upheld.  The relief was only temporary as the team lost every other game for the year. By an ironical twist, Melbourne went on to the premiership. The Saints finished last on the ladder again in 1901 and 1902, setting a record for ineptitude unequalled in a major Australian football league until [[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] took its seventh consecutive wooden spoon in [[1995 Sturt Football Club season|the 1995 season]] and finished with eight consecutive from 1989 to 1996.<ref>[http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/Sturt/322 Sturt football Club Biography]</ref> In 1903 St Kilda finished fifth on the ladder. In 1904 a committee shake-up heralded a bold new recruiting drive and the club netted much-travelled ruckman Vic Cumberland and champion Tasmanian rover Vic Barwick, but in 1904 St Kilda finished eighth on the ladder and in 1905 seventh. Within two years of the bold new recruiting drive the brilliant young forward Dave McNamara and a talented batch of interstate men were on the books and St Kilda rose to sixth place in 1906.\n\nThe St Kilda team took the football world by storm early in 1907 by winning the opening six games. Six successive wins to start the 1907 season saw the club make the finals for the first time, finishing third with nine wins and eight losses. St Kilda 4.11 (35) were beaten by Carlton 13.13 (91) in the club's first VFL final by 56 points in front of 26,100 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The team again finished third in 1908 and qualified for the finals again. St Kilda 3.8 (26) were  eliminated by Carlton 12.12 (84) by 58 points in front of 25,531 at the MCG. In 1909 and 1010 St Kilda finished last on the ladder after a protest by [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] over the eligibility of Bill Stewart whom the Saints played when suspended, second last in 1911 and third last in 1912.\n\n===1913 season===\nIn the 1913 season, St Kilda finished fourth and  made a storming run to the 1913 finals. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 10.10 (70) defeated Fitzroy 6.9 (45), in front of 54,846 at the MCG making it into the grand final. St Kilda ended up playing Fitzroy for the Premiership in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 Grand Final]] for the first time in the club's history. The match became a nightmare for the Saints when they hadn't scored a goal by half-time. At the last change they trailed by 25 points.<ref>[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1913/061519130927.html 1913 VFL Grand Final statistics]</ref> Suddenly St Kilda sparked to life and four goals brought the within a point.<ref>Ross, J.

Fitzroy then scored two more goals to win by 13 points.<ref>''The Complete History of Every club in the VFL/AFL'' p 323.</ref> Fitzroy 7-14 (56) to St Kilda 5-13 (43).\n\n===1914 and 1915 seasons===\nIn the 1914 season the St Kilda finished seventh on the ladder and did not make the finals. In 1915 they were also disappointing as the club finished eighth on the ladder. Due to [[World War I]], the St Kilda team were in recess in 1916 and 1917.\n\n== Resuming after recess: 1918\u201339 ==\nThe club resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position, but was eliminated by Collingwood in the semi-finals by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\nResults declined in the early 1920s, with the club finishing last in 1920 and 1924. The following years saw St Kilda establish itself as more consistently competitive, despite being the poorest club in the league apart from new entrants [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] owing to an absence of wealthy industrial and political patrons.<ref name=\"history\">Booth, Ross; [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ASSH%20Bulletins/No%2026/ASSHBulletin26e.pdf \u201cHistory of player recruitment, transfer and payment rules in the Victorian and Australian Football League\u201d] by LA84 Foundation</ref> [[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] played brilliantly in 1925, winning the [[Brownlow Medal]].<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/wa-wh.htm#Colin%20Watson%20(Port%20Melbourne%20&%20St%20Kilda) Football profile from FullPointsFooty.]</ref>\n\nThe St Kilda team made the finals in 1929 and were eliminated by Carlton 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals. However, financial problems and committee disputes meant that the club fell into the bottom four every year from 1931 and 1933, only avoiding the wooden spoon by eight percent in 1932.\n\nThe mid-to-late 1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making the finals again in 1939 by finishing fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and 5 losses: the best home and away season in the club's history up to that point. Unfortunately for the Saints, three other clubs did even better, but going into the first semi final against Richmond there was felt to be substantial ground for optimism as the Saints had won their last four meetings. St Kilda had not been victorious in a finals match for twenty-six years (though they had engaged in only two finals matches during that time) but for once the optimism was not misplaced as the Saints raced to a comfortable 30 point win, 10.12 (72) to 6.6 (42).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/St_Kilda_part_2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182347/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/St_Kilda_part_2.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe team had its first finals win since 1913 over [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] in the Semi Final winning 10.12 (72) to 6.6 (42) at the MCG in front of 51,411. Then in the Preliminary Final, St Kilda 15.15 (105) lost to Collingwood 20.14 (134) in front of 66,848 at the MCG on the 23/9/1939, with [[Ron Todd (footballer)|Ron Todd]] kicking eleven goals.\n\n== 1940\u201359 ==\n\nThe breakthrough win in the finals of 1939 did not herald a period of success for the club and St Kilda's fortunes took a rapid nose-dive in 1940 and thereafter the club continued to struggle. The club won three of the first four games early in the 1940 season and was on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Though there was some high-class players like [[Harold Bray]], Keith Drinan, Peter Bennett and later Neil Roberts, St Kilda were rarely competitive. Indeed, it is doubtful if the club has ever experienced a worse decade than the 1940s which yielded only 34 wins and 4 draws from 174 matches for a paltry success rate of just over 20%. During the entire decade the Saints (or the 'Panthers' as they were briefly known at around this time) only twice finished outside the bottom two, and never once achieved as many wins in a season as defeats. The club finished last seven times in 13 years between 1943 and 1955.\n\nThe 1950 season saw the club win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. The 1950s brought improvement of sorts, at least when compared to the 1940s, but St Kilda could still hardly be regarded as a glamorous club.\n\nIn 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the most massive clean-outs  of players in the history of any VFL club.  It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, while 11 new players appeared in the club's opening match of 1956.  The appointment of [[Alan Killigrew]] as coach eliminated the defeat-accepting attitude of St Kilda and soon made the team more competitive.  In the late 1950s St Kilda vied for finals berths without making the finals.  St Kilda had three consecutive Brownlow Medal winners; [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] in 1957, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] in 1958 and [[Verdun Howell]] in 1959.\n\nIn 1958 St Kilda won the Consolation Night Series competition, a competition played at night at the end of the home and away rounds between the eight teams that finished between 5th and 12th and failed to qualify for the VFL Premiership Season Finals Series.  St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\n== 1960\u201373 ==\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach.  St Kilda made the final four for the first time since 1939, finishing third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with star full-back [[Verdun Howell]] unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] 9.15 (69) to St Kilda 8.12 (60) in the first semi-final, in front of 86,411 at the MCG. In 1962 [[St Kilda Football Club]] finished 9th on the Ladder with a modest nine wins and nine losses during the home and away season. St Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins ever over the last six rounds of the 1963 season to finish in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers Hawthorn.  The club lost to [[Melbourne]] 9.17 (71) to St Kilda 8.16 (64) in the first semi-final, in front of 88,914 at the MCG. In 1964 St Kilda was defeated in the final of the [[1964 VFL season|Consolation Night Series]] competition, a competition played at night at the end of the home and away rounds between the eight teams that finished between 5th and 12th and failed to qualify for the VFL Premiership Season Finals Series. St Kilda was defeated by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73) in the final.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:180px; text-align:center; float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| '''[[1965 VFL season|1965 VFL SEASON]]'''\n|-\n| '''1st Minor Premiership'''\n|}\n\nAfter the 1964 season, the club moved to [[Moorabbin Oval]] in the south-eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]] in an effort to attract the population of a rapidly growing region. The move was a success and in 1965 St Kilda finished a game clear on top of the [[1965 VFL season|standings]] with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for the finals series in first position and winning the minor premiership for the first time in 1965. [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] won the 1965 [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nFinishing second on the table St Kilda went into the 1965 Finals Series confident. In the second semi final St Kilda 13.24 (102) defeated Collingwood 14.17 (101) by 1 point in front of 98,395 at the MCG on the 11/9/1965, which meant that they progressed to the Grand Final. St Kilda played in the Grand Final against the Essendon Football Club and lost 14.21 (105) to St Kilda's 9.16 (70) in front of 104,846 at the MCG on the 25/9/1965.\n\n===1966 season===\nIn round 1 of the 1966 VFL season, St Kilda thrashed Melbourne by 76 points at the MCG. This was followed by a 53-point win against Carlton the following round at Moorabbin Oval. In Round 3, St Kilda continued its winning streak by defeating North Melbourne 9.13.67 to St Kilda 15.13.103 and followed this by pushing aside Geelong the next week by 43 points. In the following rounds St Kilda defeated South Melbourne by 42 points, Fitzroy by 64 points, Hawthorn by 24 points and Essendon by 7 points. In Round 9, St Kilda's undefeated streak came to an end when they were defeated by Richmond at the MCG by 35 points. St Kilda were thrashed by Collingwood the following round at Victoria Park by 72 points. St Kilda won their next two games against Footscray and Melbourne before being defeated by Carlton by 16 points in Round 13. St Kilda's 38 point win against North Melbourne was followed by a loss to Geelong in round 15 by 23 points. St Kilda then won its final 3 games against South Melbourne, Fitzroy and Hawthorn. St Kilda finished with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for the finals in second place and Ian Stewart won his second consecutive [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\n{{Aussie rules team old|align=right\n| title             = St Kilda 1966 Grand Final Side\n| backpocket1       = [[Rodger Head]]\n| fullback          = [[Bob Murray (Australian footballer)|Bob Murray]]\n| backpocket2       = [[Brian Sierakowski]]\n| halfbackflank1    = [[Verdun Howell]]\n| centrehalfback    = [[Ian Synman]]\n| halfbackflank2    = [[John Bingley]]\n| wing1             = [[Jeff Moran]]\n| centre            = [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]]\n| wing2             = [[Jim Read (footballer)|Jim Read]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = [[Ian Cooper (Australian footballer born 1946)|Ian Cooper]]\n| centrehalfforward = [[Darrel Baldock]] (c)\n| halfforwardflank2 = [[Barry Breen]]\n| forwardpocket1    = [[Alan Morrow]]\n| fullforward       = [[Kevin Neale]]\n| forwardpocket2    = [[Allan Davis (footballer)|Allan Davis]]\n| ruck              = [[Brian Mynott]]\n| ruckrover         = [[Daryl Griffiths (Australian rules footballer)|Daryl Griffiths]]\n| rover             = [[Ross G.

This took St Kilda to the preliminary in which St Kilda 15.4 (94) defeated Essendon 7.10 (52) in front of 93,543 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the grand final against Collingwood. Twenty-five minutes into the final quarter and with scores level, Collingwood's Wayne Richardson had a shot at goal on the run but kicked it out of bounds on the full. St Kilda then began to work the ball out of defence after winning the boundary throw in.  A kick from Ian Cooper saw the ball make its way to centre half forward. Collingwood defender Ted Potter failed to mark the ball low down and with the players scrummaging for the ball a bounce was called. Brian Mynott won the tap for the Saints but it was intercepted by Potter who was quickly tackled. Potter however managed to get out a hand pass but it found its way to St Kilda's Barry Breen who snapped at goal and kicked a behind to put his side in front. With about a minute left on the clock, Collingwood were able to work the ball towards their forward line. Robert Murray, however, was able to take a mark at centre half back and the siren sounded after he kicked the ball towards the wing. St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final|1966 grand final]] 10-14 (74) to 10-13 (73), winning the premiership for the first time.\n\n===Post 1966===\nIn the 1967 VFL Season, Ross Smith won the leagues highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal. The 1968 season saw the Saints qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. In the 1968 Finals Series St Kilda played Geelong in the First Semi Final. St Kilda lost 11.17 (83) to Geelong 19.13 (127) at the MCG in front of 98,885 people. A disappointing seventh place home and away season finish in 1969 was followed by another finals appearance in 1970, where St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses. The St Kilda Football Club qualified for the 1970 Finals Series, in which it played South Melbourne in the First Semi Final. St Kilda ended up winning the match by 53 points, 22.11 (143) to South Melbourne 13.12 (90), in front of 104,239 at the MCG. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 7.19 (61) lost to [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] 17.21 (123) in front of 108,215 at the MCG. In the 1971 Premiership season St Kilda qualified for the Finals Series in second place at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins. In the 1971 Finals Series  St Kilda played [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the Second Semi Final in which St Kilda lost 12.16 (88) to Hawthorn 12.18 (90) in front of 99,822 at the MCG. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 16.12 (108) defeated Richmond 12.6 (78) in front of 102,484 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the Grand Final against Hawthorn in front of 118,192 at the [[MCG]]. St Kilda 11.9 (75) lost to Hawthorn 12.10 (82) on the 25/9/1971. The club then qualified fourth for the finals series in 1972, with 14 wins and 8 losses. In the 1972 Finals Series  St Kilda played Essendon in the Elimination Final in which St Kilda won 18.16 (124) to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 10.11 (71) in front of 52,499 at Waverley Park. In the First Semi Final St Kilda 11.17 (83) defeated [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] 8.17 (65) in front of 91,857 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the Preliminary Final against Carlton in front of 92,272 at the MCG. St Kilda 13.15 (93) lost to Carlton 16.13 (109) on the 30/9/1972. 1973 saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth with 12 wins. In the 1973 Finals Series  St Kilda played Essendon in the Elimination Final in which St Kilda won 24.14 (134) to Essendon 13.13 (91) in front of 53,405 at Waverley Park.

The club won one premiership and one minor premiership from 1960 to 1973.  [[Allan Jeans]] coaching career at St Kilda ended with his retirement from St Kilda's coaching team at the end of the 1976 season.\n\n== 1974\u20131989 ==\nThe 1974 season saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins. The club failed to build on competitive seasons in 1975 and 1976, finishing last in 1977. 1978 began and ended in excellent form, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. The 1979 season began well with a win over Hawthorn despite serious financial problems at the club, but thereafter St Kilda had a run of defeats and finished a clear last. Continuing financial pressure and bad on-field performances saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nThe Saints finished last 7 times in 12 seasons from 1977 to 1988. \n\nIn 1987 St Kilda, with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, moved off the bottom for the first time since 1982 with nine wins. Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season with 117 goals. He went on to win the AFL's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]], the same year.\n\n== VFL to AFL: 1990\u20132000 ==\nUnder Ken Sheldon, coach from 1990 to 1993, St Kilda underwent a brief revival, contesting finals series in 1991 and 1992 with limited success. At their best, the Saints of the early 1990s were as good as any other side in the competition. Boasting arguably the game's premier key forwards in [[Tony Lockett]] and [[Stewart Loewe]], and with a formidable midfield set up incorporating the likes of [[Nicky Winmar]], [[Nathan Burke]], [[Gilbert McAdam]] and [[Dean Greig]], St Kilda were capable, on their day, of producing some high standard football.\n\nThe Victorian Football League was renamed the Australian Football League prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season. A very competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for the finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. With Tony Lockett winning the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season with 118 goals. In the 1991 finals series St Kilda, 14.13 (97), were defeated by Geelong, 15.14 (104), in an elimination final in front of 63,796 people at Waverley Park on 8 September 1991 and were eliminated from the finals.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. In an elimination final St Kilda, 13.13 (91), defeated Collingwood, 12.11 (83), to progress to the semi-finals when, on 12 September 1992, in front of 60,000 people at Waverley Park, St Kilda, 14.6 (90), were defeated by Footscray, 19.5 (119), and were eliminated from the finals.\n\nA mediocre season in 1993 precipitated Sheldon's departure.\n\n=== Stan Alves era: 1994\u201398 ===\nUnder Stan Alves, there was little immediate indication that the club was about to turn the corner. A combination of continued financial pressures and unpredictable factors, such as the loss of glamour full forward Lockett to Sydney, made St Kilda's long-term prospects begin to look precarious.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:180px; text-align:center; float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| '''[[1996 Ansett Australia Cup|1996 AFL Ansett Cup]]'''\n|-\n| '''1st AFL Cup'''\n|}\n\nIn the 1994 premership season St Kilda finished 13th on the ladder out of 15 teams in a disappointing season. The following 1995 season, St Kilda once again disappointed as they finished 14th out of 16 teams.

St Kilda played well in the first half to lead at the main break by 13 points, but the second half was a disaster as the Crows added 14 goals to 6 to win pulling away. Players like Harvey, Cook and Jones were conspicuous for the Saints, but too many of their colleagues went missing when the action heated up. St Kilda 13.16 (94) lost to Adelaide 19.11 (125) in front of 98,828 at the MCG. In 1998 St Kilda also won through to the Ansett Australia Cup Final before being eliminated by North Melbourne. St Kilda  12.11 (83) lost to North Melbourne 14.13 (97) by 14 points at Waverley Park. In a competitive [[1998 AFL season|1998 Premiership season]], St Kilda had a great start winning 11 of its first 14 Games, but unfortunately an end of season drop of in from saw St Kilda drop down the Ladder.

The club plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), the highest league in the country.\n\nThe club was established in 1873 and its name originates from the Melbourne suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. The club was a foundation team of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1877 and in 1897 became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which was renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nThe club does not acknowledge any connection to the original St Kilda football club (1858-1864) or the 1872 St Kilda club.\n\n== Victorian Football Association: 1877\u201396 ==\n\nThe St Kilda Football Club itself was not formed until 1873, containing many elements of the previously strong South Yarra club which had disbanded a year earlier, after falling on hard times. South Yarra had won the Challenge Cup in 1866 and many of its better players lined up under the St Kilda banner. In the early stages the club played at an area known as the \"Alpaca Paddock\", next to the present site of the St Kilda Bowling Club near the St Kilda railway station. Alpacas were a kind of llama with long wool which had been imported from South America as a money-raising venture. St Kilda soon boasted a membership of 60 and showed that it would exceed its initial aim of being a junior club. By the end of the first season the Saints were able to force a draw with the top-ranking Carlton and everything looked rosy. There were tough times ahead but St Kilda's uphill battle was not without its humorous moments. Only 12 St Kilda players turned up for a match in  Bendigo and the game against Albert Park started 90 minutes late after the ball burst when it was being inflated prior to the match. Amalgamation with University did not help the cause either, but the club was still one of the original members of the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] when it was formed in 1877. That year St Kilda became only the second team to journey interstate (Melbourne had gone to South Australia a fortnight earlier) and beat Adelaide, then a combined South Australian side.\n\nBy 1879 the club slipped to its lowest ebb and after the side failed to turn up for a game at Essendon, all further matches were abandoned. St Kilda sank into junior ranks for the next six years. The club returned to senior competition in 1886 and struggled to make its mark. A decision was made to amalgamate with nearby Prahran and the St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground, as well as picking up a number of Prahran players. Even at this early point St Kilda had a reputation for being able to lift miraculously on their day and roll the best teams in the competition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Another trademark was the presence of some of the foremost players in football. Alf Smith, a champion rover, was one of the earliest stars, but the hot and cold Saints could never sustain their brilliance for long. Proof of the team's quixotic nature came in the last season it played in the VFA, when several top players missed the Collingwood game because they chose to go to the races instead!\n\nSt Kilda competed as a senior club in the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] from 1877 to 1879, 1881 to 1882 and 1886 to 1896 before competing in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) from 1897 onwards.<ref>[http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-118-0-0-0&sID=54554&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=4834479&sectionID=54554 History of the VFL: 1877 - 2007]</ref>\n\n== Early years in the VFL: 1897\u20131915 ==\nSt Kilda's early years in the Victorian Football League were not successful, finishing last in nine of the first 14 seasons. In 1899, St Kilda scored the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p 45.</ref>\n\nIn 1897, 1898 and 1899 St Kilda finished eighth on the ladder.  In the opening round of 1900 St Kilda and Melbourne tied, but a St Kilda protest over an incorrectly awarded point was upheld.  The relief was only temporary as the team lost every other game for the year. By an ironical twist, Melbourne went on to the premiership. The Saints finished last on the ladder again in 1901 and 1902, setting a record for ineptitude unequalled in a major Australian football league until [[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] took its seventh consecutive wooden spoon in [[1995 Sturt Football Club season|the 1995 season]] and finished with eight consecutive from 1989 to 1996.<ref>[http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/Sturt/322 Sturt football Club Biography]</ref> In 1903 St Kilda finished fifth on the ladder. In 1904 a committee shake-up heralded a bold new recruiting drive and the club netted much-travelled ruckman Vic Cumberland and champion Tasmanian rover Vic Barwick, but in 1904 St Kilda finished eighth on the ladder and in 1905 seventh. Within two years of the bold new recruiting drive the brilliant young forward Dave McNamara and a talented batch of interstate men were on the books and St Kilda rose to sixth place in 1906.\n\nThe St Kilda team took the football world by storm early in 1907 by winning the opening six games. Six successive wins to start the 1907 season saw the club make the finals for the first time, finishing third with nine wins and eight losses. St Kilda 4.11 (35) were beaten by Carlton 13.13 (91) in the club's first VFL final by 56 points in front of 26,100 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The team again finished third in 1908 and qualified for the finals again. St Kilda 3.8 (26) were  eliminated by Carlton 12.12 (84) by 58 points in front of 25,531 at the MCG. In 1909 and 1010 St Kilda finished last on the ladder after a protest by [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] over the eligibility of Bill Stewart whom the Saints played when suspended, second last in 1911 and third last in 1912.\n\n===1913 season===\nIn the 1913 season, St Kilda finished fourth and  made a storming run to the 1913 finals. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 10.10 (70) defeated Fitzroy 6.9 (45), in front of 54,846 at the MCG making it into the grand final. St Kilda ended up playing Fitzroy for the Premiership in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 Grand Final]] for the first time in the club's history. The match became a nightmare for the Saints when they hadn't scored a goal by half-time. At the last change they trailed by 25 points.<ref>[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1913/061519130927.html 1913 VFL Grand Final statistics]</ref> Suddenly St Kilda sparked to life and four goals brought the within a point.<ref>Ross, J.

In 1915 they were also disappointing as the club finished eighth on the ladder. Due to [[World War I]], the St Kilda team were in recess in 1916 and 1917.\n\n== Resuming after recess: 1918\u201339 ==\nThe club resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position, but was eliminated by Collingwood in the semi-finals by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\nResults declined in the early 1920s, with the club finishing last in 1920 and 1924. The following years saw St Kilda establish itself as more consistently competitive, despite being the poorest club in the league apart from new entrants [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] owing to an absence of wealthy industrial and political patrons.<ref name=\"history\">Booth, Ross; [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ASSH%20Bulletins/No%2026/ASSHBulletin26e.pdf \u201cHistory of player recruitment, transfer and payment rules in the Victorian and Australian Football League\u201d] by LA84 Foundation</ref> [[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] played brilliantly in 1925, winning the [[Brownlow Medal]].<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/wa-wh.htm#Colin%20Watson%20(Port%20Melbourne%20&%20St%20Kilda) Football profile from FullPointsFooty.]</ref>\n\nThe St Kilda team made the finals in 1929 and were eliminated by Carlton 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals. However, financial problems and committee disputes meant that the club fell into the bottom four every year from 1931 and 1933, only avoiding the wooden spoon by eight percent in 1932.\n\nThe mid-to-late 1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making the finals again in 1939 by finishing fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and 5 losses: the best home and away season in the club's history up to that point. Unfortunately for the Saints, three other clubs did even better, but going into the first semi final against Richmond there was felt to be substantial ground for optimism as the Saints had won their last four meetings. St Kilda had not been victorious in a finals match for twenty-six years (though they had engaged in only two finals matches during that time) but for once the optimism was not misplaced as the Saints raced to a comfortable 30 point win, 10.12 (72) to 6.6 (42).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/St_Kilda_part_2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182347/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/St_Kilda_part_2.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe team had its first finals win since 1913 over [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] in the Semi Final winning 10.12 (72) to 6.6 (42) at the MCG in front of 51,411. Then in the Preliminary Final, St Kilda 15.15 (105) lost to Collingwood 20.14 (134) in front of 66,848 at the MCG on the 23/9/1939, with [[Ron Todd (footballer)|Ron Todd]] kicking eleven goals.\n\n== 1940\u201359 ==\n\nThe breakthrough win in the finals of 1939 did not herald a period of success for the club and St Kilda's fortunes took a rapid nose-dive in 1940 and thereafter the club continued to struggle. The club won three of the first four games early in the 1940 season and was on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Though there was some high-class players like [[Harold Bray]], Keith Drinan, Peter Bennett and later Neil Roberts, St Kilda were rarely competitive. Indeed, it is doubtful if the club has ever experienced a worse decade than the 1940s which yielded only 34 wins and 4 draws from 174 matches for a paltry success rate of just over 20%. During the entire decade the Saints (or the 'Panthers' as they were briefly known at around this time) only twice finished outside the bottom two, and never once achieved as many wins in a season as defeats. The club finished last seven times in 13 years between 1943 and 1955.\n\nThe 1950 season saw the club win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. The 1950s brought improvement of sorts, at least when compared to the 1940s, but St Kilda could still hardly be regarded as a glamorous club.\n\nIn 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the most massive clean-outs  of players in the history of any VFL club.  It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, while 11 new players appeared in the club's opening match of 1956.  The appointment of [[Alan Killigrew]] as coach eliminated the defeat-accepting attitude of St Kilda and soon made the team more competitive.  In the late 1950s St Kilda vied for finals berths without making the finals.  St Kilda had three consecutive Brownlow Medal winners; [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] in 1957, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] in 1958 and [[Verdun Howell]] in 1959.\n\nIn 1958 St Kilda won the Consolation Night Series competition, a competition played at night at the end of the home and away rounds between the eight teams that finished between 5th and 12th and failed to qualify for the VFL Premiership Season Finals Series.  St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\n== 1960\u201373 ==\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach.  St Kilda made the final four for the first time since 1939, finishing third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with star full-back [[Verdun Howell]] unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] 9.15 (69) to St Kilda 8.12 (60) in the first semi-final, in front of 86,411 at the MCG. In 1962 [[St Kilda Football Club]] finished 9th on the Ladder with a modest nine wins and nine losses during the home and away season. St Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins ever over the last six rounds of the 1963 season to finish in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers Hawthorn.  The club lost to [[Melbourne]] 9.17 (71) to St Kilda 8.16 (64) in the first semi-final, in front of 88,914 at the MCG. In 1964 St Kilda was defeated in the final of the [[1964 VFL season|Consolation Night Series]] competition, a competition played at night at the end of the home and away rounds between the eight teams that finished between 5th and 12th and failed to qualify for the VFL Premiership Season Finals Series. St Kilda was defeated by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73) in the final.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:180px; text-align:center; float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| '''[[1965 VFL season|1965 VFL SEASON]]'''\n|-\n| '''1st Minor Premiership'''\n|}\n\nAfter the 1964 season, the club moved to [[Moorabbin Oval]] in the south-eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]] in an effort to attract the population of a rapidly growing region. The move was a success and in 1965 St Kilda finished a game clear on top of the [[1965 VFL season|standings]] with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for the finals series in first position and winning the minor premiership for the first time in 1965. [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] won the 1965 [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nFinishing second on the table St Kilda went into the 1965 Finals Series confident. In the second semi final St Kilda 13.24 (102) defeated Collingwood 14.17 (101) by 1 point in front of 98,395 at the MCG on the 11/9/1965, which meant that they progressed to the Grand Final. St Kilda played in the Grand Final against the Essendon Football Club and lost 14.21 (105) to St Kilda's 9.16 (70) in front of 104,846 at the MCG on the 25/9/1965.\n\n===1966 season===\nIn round 1 of the 1966 VFL season, St Kilda thrashed Melbourne by 76 points at the MCG. This was followed by a 53-point win against Carlton the following round at Moorabbin Oval. In Round 3, St Kilda continued its winning streak by defeating North Melbourne 9.13.67 to St Kilda 15.13.103 and followed this by pushing aside Geelong the next week by 43 points. In the following rounds St Kilda defeated South Melbourne by 42 points, Fitzroy by 64 points, Hawthorn by 24 points and Essendon by 7 points. In Round 9, St Kilda's undefeated streak came to an end when they were defeated by Richmond at the MCG by 35 points. St Kilda were thrashed by Collingwood the following round at Victoria Park by 72 points. St Kilda won their next two games against Footscray and Melbourne before being defeated by Carlton by 16 points in Round 13. St Kilda\u2019s 38 point win against North Melbourne was followed by a loss to Geelong in round 15 by 23 points. St Kilda then won its final 3 games against South Melbourne, Fitzroy and Hawthorn. St Kilda finished with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for the finals in second place and Ian Stewart won his second consecutive [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\n{{Aussie rules team old|align=right\n| title             = St Kilda 1966 Grand Final Side\n| backpocket1       = [[Rodger Head]]\n| fullback          = [[Bob Murray (Australian footballer)|Bob Murray]]\n| backpocket2       = [[Brian Sierakowski]]\n| halfbackflank1    = [[Verdun Howell]]\n| centrehalfback    = [[Ian Synman]]\n| halfbackflank2    = [[John Bingley]]\n| wing1             = [[Jeff Moran]]\n| centre            = [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]]\n| wing2             = [[Jim Read (footballer)|Jim Read]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = [[Ian Cooper (Australian footballer born 1946)|Ian Cooper]]\n| centrehalfforward = [[Darrel Baldock]] (c)\n| halfforwardflank2 = [[Barry Breen]]\n| forwardpocket1    = [[Alan Morrow]]\n| fullforward       = [[Kevin Neale]]\n| forwardpocket2    = [[Allan Davis (footballer)|Allan Davis]]\n| ruck              = [[Brian Mynott]]\n| ruckrover         = [[Daryl Griffiths (Australian rules footballer)|Daryl Griffiths]]\n| rover             = [[Ross G.

This took St Kilda to the preliminary in which St Kilda 15.4 (94) defeated Essendon 7.10 (52) in front of 93,543 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the grand final against Collingwood. Twenty-five minutes into the final quarter and with scores level, Collingwood's Wayne Richardson had a shot at goal on the run but kicked it out of bounds on the full. St Kilda then began to work the ball out of defence after winning the boundary throw in.  A kick from Ian Cooper saw the ball make its way to centre half forward. Collingwood defender Ted Potter failed to mark the ball low down and with the players scrummaging for the ball a bounce was called. Brian Mynott won the tap for the Saints but it was intercepted by Potter who was quickly tackled. Potter however managed to get out a hand pass but it found its way to St Kilda's Barry Breen who snapped at goal and kicked a behind to put his side in front. With about a minute left on the clock, Collingwood were able to work the ball towards their forward line. Robert Murray, however, was able to take a mark at centre half back and the siren sounded after he kicked the ball towards the wing. St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final|1966 grand final]] 10-14 (74) to 10-13 (73), winning the premiership for the first time.\n\n===Post 1966===\nIn the 1967 VFL Season, Ross Smith won the leagues highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal. The 1968 season saw the Saints qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. In the 1968 Finals Series St Kilda played Geelong in the First Semi Final. St Kilda lost 11.17 (83) to Geelong 19.13 (127) at the MCG in front of 98,885 people. A disappointing seventh place home and away season finish in 1969 was followed by another finals appearance in 1970, where St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses. The St Kilda Football Club qualified for the 1970 Finals Series, in which it played South Melbourne in the First Semi Final. St Kilda ended up winning the match by 53 points, 22.11 (143) to South Melbourne 13.12 (90), in front of 104,239 at the MCG. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 7.19 (61) lost to [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] 17.21 (123) in front of 108,215 at the MCG. In the 1971 Premiership season St Kilda qualified for the Finals Series in second place at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins. In the 1971 Finals Series  St Kilda played [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the Second Semi Final in which St Kilda lost 12.16 (88) to Hawthorn 12.18 (90) in front of 99,822 at the MCG. In the Preliminary Final St Kilda 16.12 (108) defeated Richmond 12.6 (78) in front of 102,484 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the Grand Final against Hawthorn in front of 118,192 at the [[MCG]]. St Kilda 11.9 (75) lost to Hawthorn 12.10 (82) on the 25/9/1971. The club then qualified fourth for the finals series in 1972, with 14 wins and 8 losses. In the 1972 Finals Series  St Kilda played Essendon in the Elimination Final in which St Kilda won 18.16 (124) to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 10.11 (71) in front of 52,499 at Waverley Park. In the First Semi Final St Kilda 11.17 (83) defeated [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] 8.17 (65) in front of 91,857 at the MCG. This took St Kilda to the Preliminary Final against Carlton in front of 92,272 at the MCG. St Kilda 13.15 (93) lost to Carlton 16.13 (109) on the 30/9/1972. 1973 saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth with 12 wins. In the 1973 Finals Series  St Kilda played Essendon in the Elimination Final in which St Kilda won 24.14 (134) to Essendon 13.13 (91) in front of 53,405 at Waverley Park. In the First Semi Final St Kilda 9.14 (68) lost to Richmond 15.18 (108) in front of 86,483at the MCG.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1973, St Kilda qualified for 9 finals series in 13 years, four preliminary finals including three in a row in 1970, 1971 & 1972, and 3 Grand Finals in 1965, 1966 and 1971. The club won one premiership and one minor premiership from 1960 to 1973.  [[Allan Jeans]] coaching career at St Kilda ended with his retirement from St Kilda's coaching team at the end of the 1976 season.\n\n== 1974\u20131989 ==\nThe 1974 season saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins. The club failed to build on competitive seasons in 1975 and 1976, finishing last in 1977. 1978 began and ended in excellent form, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. The 1979 season began well with a win over Hawthorn despite serious financial problems at the club, but thereafter St Kilda had a run of defeats and finished a clear last. Continuing financial pressure and bad on-field performances saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nThe Saints finished last 7 times in 12 seasons from 1977 to 1988. \n\nIn 1987 St Kilda, with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, moved off the bottom for the first time since 1982 with nine wins. Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season with 117 goals. He went on to win the AFL's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]], the same year.\n\n== VFL to AFL: 1990\u20132000 ==\nUnder Ken Sheldon, coach from 1990 to 1993, St Kilda underwent a brief revival, contesting finals series in 1991 and 1992 with limited success. At their best, the Saints of the early 1990s were as good as any other side in the competition. Boasting arguably the game's premier key forwards in [[Tony Lockett]] and [[Stewart Loewe]], and with a formidable midfield set up incorporating the likes of [[Nicky Winmar]], [[Nathan Burke]], [[Gilbert McAdam]] and [[Dean Greig]], St Kilda were capable, on their day, of producing some high standard football.\n\nThe Victorian Football League was renamed the Australian Football League prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season. A very competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for the finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. With Tony Lockett winning the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season with 118 goals. In the 1991 finals series St Kilda, 14.13 (97), were defeated by Geelong, 15.14 (104), in an elimination final in front of 63,796 people at Waverley Park on 8 September 1991 and were eliminated from the finals.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. In an elimination final St Kilda, 13.13 (91), defeated Collingwood, 12.11 (83), to progress to the semi-finals when, on 12 September 1992, in front of 60,000 people at Waverley Park, St Kilda, 14.6 (90), were defeated by Footscray, 19.5 (119), and were eliminated from the finals.\n\nA mediocre season in 1993 precipitated Sheldon's departure.\n\n=== Stan Alves era: 1994\u201398 ===\nUnder Stan Alves, there was little immediate indication that the club was about to turn the corner. A combination of continued financial pressures and unpredictable factors, such as the loss of glamour full forward Lockett to Sydney, made St Kilda's long-term prospects begin to look precarious.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:180px; text-align:center; float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| '''[[1996 Ansett Australia Cup|1996 AFL Ansett Cup]]'''\n|-\n| '''1st AFL Cup'''\n|}\n\nIn the 1994 premership season St Kilda finished 13th on the ladder out of 15 teams in a disappointing season. The following 1995 season, St Kilda once again disappointed as they finished 14th out of 16 teams. St Kilda won the [[1996 Ansett Australia Cup]] pre-season competition with a 58 point defeat of reigning day premiers Carlton. The team had wins over Hawthorn in the round of 16, Adelaide in the quarter finals, West Coast in the semi-finals and defeated Carlton in the final 20-10 (130) to 10-12 (72) in front of 66,888 people at Waverley Park, with [[Nicky Winmar]] winning the [[Michael Tuck Medal]] for the player judged best on ground. In the 1996 season St Kilda disappointed its supporters after a promising pre-season competition to find itself finished 10th after round 22. St Kilda won just 10 games for the season.\n\n[[File:St Kilda FC Cross Jumper.png|thumb|right|130px| [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda's]] home jumper in 1997.]]\n\nIn the [[1997 AFL season|1997 premiership season]], St Kilda had a consistent home and away season. St Kilda qualified for the 1997 finals series in first position at the end of the home and away rounds with 15 wins and 7 losses and [[1997 AFL season|winning the minor premiership]] for the second time in the club's history.

In a preliminary final St Kilda 15.14 (104) defeated North Melbourne 11.7 (73) by 31 points at the MCG in front of 77,531. St Kilda was now in the [[AFL Grand Final]] against Adelaide. St Kilda played well in the first half to lead at the main break by 13 points, but the second half was a disaster as the Crows added 14 goals to 6 to win pulling away. Players like Harvey, Cook and Jones were conspicuous for the Saints, but too many of their colleagues went missing when the action heated up. St Kilda 13.16 (94) lost to Adelaide 19.11 (125) in front of 98,828 at the MCG. In 1998 St Kilda also won through to the Ansett Australia Cup Final before being eliminated by North Melbourne. St Kilda  12.11 (83) lost to North Melbourne 14.13 (97) by 14 points at Waverley Park. In a competitive [[1998 AFL season|1998 Premiership season]], St Kilda had a great start winning 11 of its first 14 Games, but unfortunately an end of season drop of in from saw St Kilda drop down the Ladder. St Kilda again qualified for the Finals Series finishing sixth. [[Robert Harvey (footballer)|Robert Harvey]] won his second successive Brownlow Medal. In the 1998 Finals Series St Kilda 13.9 (87) was defeated by Sydney 12.17 (89) in the Qualifying Final in front of 36,076 at the SCG on the 5/9/1998. In the Semi Final, St Kilda 7.14 (56) lost to Melbourne 15.17 (107) by 51 in front of 88,456 at the MCG.

Thomas had a focus on 'man-management' in his coaching style, as well as conducting practices on the running of the club that are common in the business world.  This new style of coaching was characterised by Thomas's occasional use of jargon such as \"processes\" and \"outcomes\" - although they are now terms almost universally used by all coaches.\n\nIn the 2001 season St Kilda finished 15th (out of 16) with four wins.

This version had been prepared for rehearsals of a ballet interpretation of the Concerto, to be performed by the Ballet Theatre in New York. This performance never took place, and the piano score was shelved.

The world premiere recording of this edited reduction was made by Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor in 1987, on CBS Masterworks: the CD also includes piano versions of the Dance Suite, Sz. 77 and Petite Suite, Sz. 105, which was adapted from some of the 44 Violin Duos.<ref>Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor, Liner notes to the cited recording (MK 44526)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMSLP2|work=Concerto_for_Orchestra%2C_Sz.116_%28Bart%C3%B3k%2C_B%C3%A9la%29|cname=Concerto for Orchestra}}\n\n{{Bartok concertos}}\n{{B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Concerto For Orchestra (Bartok)}}\n[[Category:Modernist compositions]]\n[[Category:Music commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky or the Koussevitzky Music Foundation]]\n[[Category:Concertos by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]\n[[Category:Concertos for orchestra|Bartok, Concerto for orchestra]]\n[[Category:1943 compositions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical composition\n| name                = Concerto for Orchestra\n| composer            = [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]\n| image               = Bart\u00f3k B\u00e9la 1927.jpg\n| caption             = The composer in 1927\n| catalogue           = [[Andr\u00e1s Sz\u00f6ll\u0151sy|Sz.]] 116, BB 123\n| composed            = 1943 rev. 1945\n|duration=About 38 minutes| movements           = Five\n| scoring             =[[Orchestra]] \n|premiere_date={{start date|1944|12|01|df=y}}|premiere_conductor=[[Serge Koussevitzky]]|premiere_location=[[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]], [[Boston]]|premiere_performers=[[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]}}\nThe '''Concerto for Orchestra''', [[Andr\u00e1s Sz\u00f6ll\u0151sy|Sz.]] 116, BB 123, is a five-movement [[orchestra|orchestral work]] composed by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] in 1943.

This version had been prepared for rehearsals of a ballet interpretation of the Concerto, to be performed by the Ballet Theatre in New York. This performance never took place, and the piano score was shelved. Soon after the discovery of this manuscript, Peter Bart\u00f3k asked the Hungarian pianist [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]] to prepare the manuscript for publication and performance. The world premiere recording of this edited reduction was made by Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor in 1987, on CBS Masterworks: the CD also includes piano versions of the Dance Suite, Sz. 77 and Petite Suite, Sz. 105, which was adapted from some of the 44 Violin Duos.<ref>Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor, Liner notes to the cited recording (MK 44526)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMSLP2|work=Concerto_for_Orchestra%2C_Sz.116_%28Bart%C3%B3k%2C_B%C3%A9la%29|cname=Concerto for Orchestra}}\n\n{{Bartok concertos}}\n{{B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Concerto For Orchestra (Bartok)}}\n[[Category:Modernist compositions]]\n[[Category:Music commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky or the Koussevitzky Music Foundation]]\n[[Category:Concertos by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]\n[[Category:Concertos for orchestra|Bartok, Concerto for orchestra]]\n[[Category:1943 compositions]]\n", "name_user": "Noahfgodard", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_for_Orchestra_(Bart%C3%B3k)"}

It is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} long, rises in [[Dodington Park]], South Gloucestershire, and flows in a south westerly direction through Bristol, joining the former course of the [[River Avon (Bristol)|river Avon]] in Bristol's [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]]. The mean flow at [[Frenchay]] is {{convert|60|cuft/s|m3/s}} The name ''Frome'' is shared with several other rivers in [[South West England]] and means 'fair, fine, brisk\u2019. The river is familiarly known in east Bristol as the ''Danny''.\n\nOriginally the Frome joined the Avon downstream of [[Bristol Bridge]], and formed part of the city defences, but in the thirteenth century the river was diverted through [[marshland]] belonging to [[Bristol Cathedral|St Augustine's Abbey]] (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the lower reaches of the river were [[culvert]]ed and the river now flows under [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]] into St Augustine's Reach.\n\nAs with many [[urban stream|urban rivers]], the Frome has suffered from [[Water pollution|pollution]], but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many [[watermill]]s and the area around the river mouth was developed as [[shipyard]]s by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of [[storm drain]]s and diversions.\n\n==Course==\n{{Convert|20|mi|km}} long, the River Frome rises in the grounds of [[Dodington Park]] in the [[Cotswolds]] of [[South Gloucestershire]], flows through [[Chipping Sodbury]] in a north westerly direction through [[Yate]], and is then joined by the Nibley brook at [[Nibley, South Gloucestershire|Nibley]] and the Mayshill brook at Algars Manor near Iron Acton, both on the left. The river turns south towards the next settlement of [[Frampton Cotterell]], where it is met by the Ladden brook on the right bank.  Continuing southwards between Yate and [[Winterbourne, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], the Frome crosses [[Winterbourne Down, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne Down]], to Damsons Bridge where the Folly brook tributary merges on the left bank.\n\nThe Bradley brook joins on the right bank at [[Hambrook]] just before the river passes underneath the [[M4 motorway]] and, also on the right, the Stoke brook (or Hambrook) joins at Bromley Heath. After passing under the [[A4174]] the Frome enters a more urban environment passing between [[Frenchay]] on the right and [[Bromley Heath]] and [[Downend, South Gloucestershire|Downend]] on the left. Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters [[Oldbury Court]] estate, a [[Parks of Bristol|city park]] also known as Vassal's, where it is joined by the first of two Fishponds brooks both on the left. The river then passes [[Snuff Mills]], entering a steep valley at [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]], where the second Fishponds brook joins, then passing Eastville park, where it feeds the former boating lake.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Environment-Planning/Pollution/bristol-living-rivers--watercourses.en?page=11#internalSection11\n|title=Waterways Monitoring - Fishponds Brook\n|publisher=Bristol City Council\n|accessdate=2009-11-27\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe river then flows under the [[M32 motorway]] and parallels its course for a while before disappearing into an underground culvert at Eastville Sluices, upstream of [[Baptist Mills]].

At the site of the former Stone Bridge, near the junction of Rupert Street and Christmas Street, the main flow is channelled through Mylnes Culvert. This follows the course of Marsh Street, Prince Street and Wapping Road, and joins the New Cut close to Gaol Ferry Bridge. The culverted section between Stone Bridge and St Augustine's Reach is now a flood relief channel.\n\n===Navigation===\n\nFrom Damsons Bridge ([[British national grid reference system|Grid Reference]] {{Gbmappingsmall|ST657794}}) to [[Snuff Mills]] ({{Gbmappingsmall|ST623764}}) the river is navigable, but only by canoe (kayak) though some [[portage|portaging]] may be required.

The narrow strip of high land between the two rivers was a naturally strategic place for the Saxon town of Brigstow, later the walled centre of the city, to develop.  When [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], rebuilt [[Bristol Castle]], the Frome was diverted (at present-day Broad Weir) to form the castle moat, so that the city was entirely surrounded by water.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 93\u201396]].</ref>\n\nIn the mid-thirteenth century the harbour had become so busy that it was decided to divert the Frome into a new course through a marsh belonging to [[Bristol Cathedral|St Augustine's Abbey]] into a \"Deep Ditch\" that was dug from Stone Bridge to join the Avon at the present site of Prince Street bridge.  This has been the line of the river ever since, known as St Augustine's Reach.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 97\u201398]].</ref>\n\nThe [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]] was constructed in 1809, isolating the Avon and Frome from tides between [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] and Totterdown Lock.  The increasing use of the Frome as an open sewer combined with the loss of the scouring action of the tides meant that it was now becoming a health hazard and in 1825 it was again diverted, with locks at Stone House, channelling the main flow through Mylne's Culvert to the tidal Avon at New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge.  Up to 1858 the Frome was open along its whole length, and crossed by some 13 bridges.  During the latter half of the nineteenth century, a culvert was built from Wade Street in St Judes to Stone Bridge, covering this stretch completely: Rupert Street, Fairfax Street and Broad Weir run over this culverted section.  St Augustine's Trench from Stone Bridge to Draw Bridge (near the northern end of Baldwin Street) was covered over in 1893 and the section between that point and the bottom of Park Street was covered over in 1938.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 99\u2013102]].</ref>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n[[Shipbuilding]] on the River Frome may have been carried out for centuries, with docks on the northern part of Narrow Quay (St Clements Dock and Aldworth's Dock) being archaeologically excavated. By the seventeenth century, [[Francis Baylie]] built [[warship]]s on the east bank at Narrow [[Quay]].  Tombs' [[Dock (maritime)|Dock]] was built opposite at Dean's Marsh in 1760, on the west bank of the Frome and was later lengthened to 435 feet, the builders including [[FW Green]], and two additional docks were built by at [[Sydenham Teast|Teast]]'s Docks in 1790; a drydock later known as Albert Dock and a mud dock at Mansfield's point.

It is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} long, rises in [[Dodington Park]], South Gloucestershire, and flows in a south westerly direction through Bristol, joining the former course of the [[River Avon (Bristol)|river Avon]] in Bristol's [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]]. The mean flow at [[Frenchay]] is {{convert|60|cuft/s|m3/s}} The name ''Frome'' is shared with several other rivers in [[South West England]] and means 'fair, fine, brisk\u2019. The river is familiarly known in east Bristol as the ''Danny''.\n\nOriginally the Frome joined the Avon downstream of [[Bristol Bridge]], and formed part of the city defences, but in the thirteenth century the river was diverted through [[marshland]] belonging to [[Bristol Cathedral|St Augustine's Abbey]] (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the lower reaches of the river were [[culvert]]ed and the river now flows under [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]] into St Augustine's Reach.\n\nAs with many [[urban stream|urban rivers]], the Frome has suffered from [[Water pollution|pollution]], but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many [[watermill]]s and the area around the river mouth was developed as [[shipyard]]s by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of [[storm drain]]s and diversions.\n\n==Course==\n{{Convert|20|mi|km}} long, the River Frome rises in the grounds of [[Dodington Park]] in the [[Cotswolds]] of [[South Gloucestershire]], flows through [[Chipping Sodbury]] in a north westerly direction through [[Yate]], and is then joined by the Nibley brook at [[Nibley, South Gloucestershire|Nibley]] and the Mayshill brook at Algars Manor near Iron Acton, both on the left. The river turns south towards the next settlement of [[Frampton Cotterell]], where it is met by the Ladden brook on the right bank.  Continuing southwards between Yate and [[Winterbourne, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], the Frome crosses [[Winterbourne Down, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne Down]], to Damsons Bridge where the Folly brook tributary merges on the left bank.\n\nThe Bradley brook joins on the right bank at [[Hambrook]] just before the river passes underneath the [[M4 motorway]] and, also on the right, the Stoke brook (or Hambrook) joins at Bromley Heath. After passing under the [[A4174]] the Frome enters a more urban environment passing between [[Frenchay]] on the right and [[Bromley Heath]] and [[Downend, South Gloucestershire|Downend]] on the left. Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters [[Oldbury Court]] estate, a [[Parks of Bristol|city park]] also known as Vassal's, where it is joined by the first of two Fishponds brooks both on the left. The river then passes [[Snuff Mills]], entering a steep valley at [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]], where the second Fishponds brook joins, then passing Eastville park, where it feeds the former boating lake.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Environment-Planning/Pollution/bristol-living-rivers--watercourses.en?page=11#internalSection11\n|title=Waterways Monitoring - Fishponds Brook\n|publisher=Bristol City Council\n|accessdate=2009-11-27\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe river then flows under the [[M32 motorway]] and parallels its course for a while before disappearing into an underground culvert at Eastville Sluices, upstream of [[Baptist Mills]].

At the site of the former Stone Bridge, near the junction of Rupert Street and Christmas Street, the main flow is channelled through Mylnes Culvert. This follows the course of Marsh Street, Prince Street and Wapping Road, and joins the New Cut close to Gaol Ferry Bridge. The culverted section between Stone Bridge and St Augustine's Reach is now a flood relief channel.\n\n===Navigation===\n\nFrom Damsons Bridge ([[British national grid reference system|Grid Reference]] {{Gbmappingsmall|ST657794}}) to [[Snuff Mills]] ({{Gbmappingsmall|ST623764}}) the river is navigable, but only by canoe (kayak) though some [[portage|portaging]] may be required.  It's also possible to start at Moorend Bridge ({{Gbmappingsmall|ST650794}}) or Frenchay Bridge ({{Gbmappingsmall|ST644777}}).

The narrow strip of high land between the two rivers was a naturally strategic place for the Saxon town of Brigstow, later the walled centre of the city, to develop.  When [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], rebuilt [[Bristol Castle]], the Frome was diverted (at present-day Broad Weir) to form the castle moat, so that the city was entirely surrounded by water.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 93\u201396]].</ref>\n\nIn the mid-thirteenth century the harbour had become so busy that it was decided to divert the Frome into a new course through a marsh belonging to [[Bristol Cathedral|St Augustine's Abbey]] into a \"Deep Ditch\" that was dug from Stone Bridge to join the Avon at the present site of Prince Street bridge.  This has been the line of the river ever since, known as St Augustine's Reach.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 97\u201398]].</ref>\n\nThe [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]] was constructed in 1809, isolating the Avon and Frome from tides between [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland Basin]] and Totterdown Lock.  The increasing use of the Frome as an open sewer combined with the loss of the scouring action of the tides meant that it was now becoming a health hazard and in 1825 it was again diverted, with locks at Stone House, channelling the main flow through Mylne's Culvert to the tidal Avon at New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge.  Up to 1858 the Frome was open along its whole length, and crossed by some 13 bridges.  During the latter half of the nineteenth century, a culvert was built from Wade Street in St Judes to Stone Bridge, covering this stretch completely: Rupert Street, Fairfax Street and Broad Weir run over this culverted section.  St Augustine's Trench from Stone Bridge to Draw Bridge (near the northern end of Baldwin Street) was covered over in 1893 and the section between that point and the bottom of Park Street was covered over in 1938.<ref>[[#refWatson1991|Watson, 99\u2013102]].</ref>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n\n[[Shipbuilding]] on the River Frome may have been carried out for centuries, with docks on the northern part of Narrow Quay (St Clements Dock and Aldworth's Dock) being archaeologically excavated. By the seventeenth century, [[Francis Baylie]] built [[warship]]s on the east bank at Narrow [[Quay]].  Tombs' [[Dock (maritime)|Dock]] was built opposite at Dean's Marsh in 1760, on the west bank of the Frome and was later lengthened to 435 feet, the builders including [[FW Green]], and two additional docks were built by at [[Sydenham Teast|Teast]]'s Docks in 1790; a drydock later known as Albert Dock and a mud dock at Mansfield's point.

That was the last year that the [[Arizona Cardinals|now-Arizona Cardinals]] played there before moving to [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] in 1988. The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history; the team previously called Cleveland, Ohio home until 1946.\n\nThe Rams played their home games at what is now known as [[The Dome at America's Center]] in downtown St. Louis, which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team. The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the [[New England Patriots]] was forced out of power by their stadium's owner and operator.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri, so they were forced to temporarily share [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Their first game in St. Louis against [[1995 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] was played on September 10, 1995 with the Rams winning 17\u201313. The then- [[Trans World Airlines|Trans World]] Dome opened on November 12, 1995 with the home team scoring a 28\u201317 victory against [[1995 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]]. \n\nThe Rams' last game played in St. Louis, in what was by then known as the [[Edward Jones Dome]], was against [[2015 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31\u201323. The Rams\u2019 last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at [[Levi's Stadium]], when they lost in overtime 19\u201316. Following the 2015 NFL season, the team returned to Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the Rams' tenure in St. Louis, the franchise won its first and, to date, only [[Super Bowl]] title in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] and made a second appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]]. Assisted by [[the Greatest Show on Turf]] offense, the Rams enjoyed their greatest period of success from [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|1999]] to [[2003 St. Louis Rams season|2003]], but struggled throughout their remaining years in St. Louis. Upon their relocation back to Los Angeles, the Rams had gone twelve seasons without obtaining a winning record and eleven seasons without qualifying for the postseason.\n\n==Origins==\n{{main|History of the Cleveland Rams|History of the Los Angeles Rams}}\n\n===Cardinals move to Arizona and begin new approach===\n{{further|History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)}}\nFor 22 of their 28 years the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] called [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] home after it opened in 1966, after spending their first six seasons in St. Louis at [[Sportsman's Park]]; they shared both stadiums with [[St. Louis Cardinals|the baseball team of the same name]]. However, the overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with stadium issues,<ref>Kiley, Mike; \u2018New Stadium at Issue in St. Louis, Too\u2019; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', June 22, 1987, p. 7</ref> caused game attendance to dwindle. Consequently, the Bidwills, the family that owned the Cardinals, decided to move the team for a second time after having relocated the franchise from [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago]] to St. Louis in 1960. The cities the Bidwills considered included [[Baltimore]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[New York City]], and [[Jacksonville]], whilst [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] also made overtures without Bidwell considering them.<ref>Asher, Mark; \u2018Cardinals Owner Seen Leaning to Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 24, 1987, p. E01</ref> Nonetheless, Cardinals fans were unhappy at losing their team,<ref>Litsky, Frank; \u2018Cardinals Struggle Before Empty Seats\u2019; ''New York Times''; December 10, 1987, p. D1</ref> and [[Bill Bidwill]], fearing for his safety, stayed away from several of the 1987 home games. The Cardinals\u2019 final home game in St. Louis was on December 13, 1987, which they won 27\u201324 over [[1987 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in front of 29,623 fans on a late Sunday afternoon.\n\nNot long after the 1987 season, Bidwill agreed to move to the [[Phoenix area]] on a handshake deal with state and local officials,<ref>\u2018Football Cardinals Settle on Phoenix\u2019; ''[[New York Times]]'', January 16, 1988, p. 47</ref> and the team became [[History of the Arizona Cardinals|the Phoenix Cardinals]]. They planned to play at [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State University]]\u2019s [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] on a temporary basis while a new stadium was being built. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, the [[savings and loan crisis]] derailed financing for the stadium, forcing the Cardinals to play at Arizona State for 18 years. The team changed its name to the Arizona Cardinals for [[1994 Arizona Cardinals season|the 1994 season]].\n\n==== The move to Anaheim ====\nPrior to the Rams\u2019 [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|1979 Super Bowl season]], owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] drowned in an accident. His widow, [[Georgia Frontiere]], inherited 70% ownership of the team. Frontiere fired her step-son, Steve Rosenbloom, and assumed total control of the franchise. As had been planned prior to Carroll Rosenbloom's death, the Rams moved from their longtime home at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in nearby [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in 1980. The move was necessitated in part by the fact that the Coliseum was difficult to sell out because of its abnormally large [[seating capacity]] (100,000),<ref>Riess, Steven A.; ''Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century: An Encyclopedia'', p. 754 {{ISBN|1317459474}}</ref> subjecting the team to the league's local-market TV [[NFL blackout|blackout rule]], whenever home games did not sell out. Also, Southern California's population patterns were changing; there was rapid growth in L.A.\u2019s affluent suburbs (e.g. greater Orange County) and a decline in the city of Los Angeles\u2019 citizenship and earning power.<ref name=\"shopping\">Stellino, Vito; \u2018Rams\u2019 shopping bag is filled with NFL frustration\u2019; ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', November 25, 1993, p. 1D</ref> Anaheim Stadium was originally built in 1966 as the home of the [[History of the Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]] Major League Baseball franchise. To accommodate the Rams\u2019 move, the ballpark was reconfigured with luxury suites and enclosed to accommodate crowds of about 65,000 for football.\n\nIn 1982 the Coliseum was occupied by the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] (now the [[History of the Oakland Raiders|Oakland Raiders]] and from 2020 the [[Las Vegas Raiders]]). The combined effect of these two factors was to force the Rams\u2019 traditional fan base to be split between two teams. Making matters even worse, at this time the Rams were unsuccessful on the field, while the Raiders were thriving \u2014 even winning [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1983. Meanwhile, [[List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons|the Los Angeles Lakers]] won [[NBA Finals|championships]] in 1980 and 1982 en route to winning five titles in that decade, [[List of Los Angeles Dodgers seasons|the Los Angeles Dodgers]] won the [[World Series]] in 1981 and 1988, and [[List of Los Angeles Kings seasons|the Los Angeles Kings]], buoyed by the acquisition of [[Wayne Gretzky]] in August 1988, advanced to the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\n===1990\u201394: Frontiere\u2019s end game for the L.A. Rams===\nAlthough not apparent at the time, the Rams\u2019 loss in the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|1989 NFC Championship Game]] marked the end of an era. The Rams would not have another winning season in Los Angeles before relocation. The first half of the 1990s featured four straight 10-loss (or worse) seasons, no playoff appearances and waning fan interest. The return of [[Chuck Knox]] as head coach after successful stints as head coach of [[List of Buffalo Bills seasons|the Buffalo Bills]] and [[List of Seattle Seahawks seasons|Seattle Seahawks]] would not boost the Rams\u2019 fortunes. Knox's run-oriented offense brought about the end of offensive coordinator [[Ernie Zampese]]\u2019s tenure in 1993. General manager John Shaw was perceived by some to continually squander [[NFL Draft]] picks on sub-standard talent. The offensive scheme was not only unspectacular to watch, but dull by 1990s standards, further alienating fans. One bright spot for the offense during this time would be running back [[Jerome Bettis]], a bruising running back from Notre Dame. Bettis flourished in Knox\u2019s offense, running for 1,429 yards as a rookie and 1,025 in his sophomore effort.\n\nAs early as the close [[1992 Los Angeles Rams season|of the 1992 season]], Georgia Frontiere announced she wanted to break the Rams\u2019 lease of Anaheim Stadium.<ref>Shaffer, Gina; \u2018Pasadena, Los Angeles looking into bids for Rams: The field of potential rivals for the team widens after Rams officials announce their intention to break their lease\u2019; ''[[Orange County Register]]'', January 11, 1933, p. B08</ref> After the 1993 season, Frontiere attempted to move the Rams to Baltimore,<ref>\u2018Frontiere Might Move Rams to Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'', December 25, 1993, p. E3</ref> but her fellow owners turned that proposal down. Frontiere then sought to relocate the team to [[St. Louis]]. This move was initially voted down as well, with 21 opposed, 3 in favor (the Rams, [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]), and 6 abstaining.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/sports/pro-football-nfl-owners-reject-rams-bid-to-move-to-st-louis.html | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=George | title=PRO FOOTBALL; N.F.L.

As part of the relocation deal, the city of St. Louis agreed to build a taxpayer-financed stadium, the [[The Dome at America's Center|Trans World Dome]], and guaranteed that the stadium's amenities would be maintained in the top 25% of all NFL stadiums. Frontiere waived the clause after a 10-year threshold period passed, as the city implemented a later plan to improve the stadium.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-13/news/mn-54268_1_rams-owner | title=NFL Owners OK Rams\u2019 Move to St. Louis | author=T.J. Simers | date=April 13, 1995 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe move left many in the [[Los Angeles area]], and many of those indifferent to the whole situation, embittered toward the NFL. That sentiment was best expressed by actor and ex-Ram [[Fred Dryer]], who at the time said \u201cI hate these people [the organization and its owner] for what they did, taking the Rams logo with them when they moved to St. Louis. That logo belonged to Southern California.\u201d Steve Rosenbloom, general manager of the team during his father's tenure as owner, opined that teams come and go, but for a team to leave Los Angeles \u2014 the second largest media market in America \u2014 for St. Louis (approximately the 18th-largest) was simply irresponsible and foolish, in spite of the notoriously fickle support of Los Angeles fans. With the Raiders moving from L.A. back to Oakland only a few months later, the NFL would have no franchise in Los Angeles for two decades, although the Coliseum was used for professional football in 2001 by the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] of the now-defunct [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].\n\n==First years (1995 to 1998)==\nWhile the Rams dealt with stadium concerns in Los Angeles, efforts were under way to regain an NFL franchise in St. Louis to play in a new domed stadium slated to open in 1995. First, [[Anheuser-Busch]] scion [[James Orthwein|Jim Orthwein]] tried, and ultimately failed, to move [[History of the New England Patriots|the New England Patriots]] to St. Louis. Then, despite being heavily favored along with [[Charlotte]] to win an expansion team, St. Louis lost to a group from [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. So certain, in fact, did it appear that St. Louis would gain an expansion franchise, that the team had a name selected \u2013 [[St. Louis Stallions|the Stallions]] \u2013 and T-shirts with the team's logo were made very briefly available for sale at a number of St. Louis area sports shops.\n\nJust before moving to St. Louis, the Rams fired Knox and hired [[Rich Brooks]], longtime successful football coach at [[Oregon Ducks football|the University of Oregon]], to replace him. The team played its first several games in St. Louis at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] (the home of the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals from 1966 until 1987) as work finished on their new home, the Trans World Dome. Brooks jettisoned Knox's run-oriented scheme in favor of a powerful air attack. Bettis all but disappeared from the offense, rushing for only 637 yards. Despite this, the Rams started off well, getting off to a 5\u20131 start. However, a 44\u201310 thumping by the 49ers in the last game at Busch Stadium sent the team into a downward spiral, and they ultimately finished 7\u20139 \u2014 still the franchise's closest to \u201ccontention\u201d since 1989. Perhaps the most memorable aspect was that veteran offensive lineman and future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jackie Slater]] played his 20th and final season with the team in its new St. Louis location.\n\n===Vermeil era===\nThe next three seasons would largely be a repeat of the Rams\u2019 last five seasons in Los Angeles. The team drafted highly touted [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] running back [[Lawrence Phillips]] with the sixth overall pick in the [[1996 NFL Draft]], making Bettis expendable. Bettis would be traded to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in exchange for draft picks, a move now seen as one of the most lopsided trades in professional sports history, strongly favoring the Steelers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap2000000336962|title=Top 15 trades in NFL history|work=NFL.com|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> After regressing to 6\u201310 in 1996, Brooks was replaced by [[Dick Vermeil]]. Vermeil had enjoyed success as the head coach of [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] (where he won a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]]) and [[List of Philadelphia Eagles seasons|the Philadelphia Eagles]], whom he had led to [[Super Bowl XV]]. However, Vermeil left the Eagles after an unsuccessful [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], claiming burnout, and proceeded to spend much of the next decade and a half as a college football commentator for [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]].\n\nVermeil's first two seasons as Rams coach were as unsuccessful as many of the preceding seasons. Phillips was cut from the team mid-season in 1997, cementing his status as a [[Draft (sports)#Other terminology|draft bust]].\n\nThe Rams\u2019 struggles continued in 1998. At the close of that season the franchise had suffered a nine-season streak in which the team compiled a dismal record of 45\u201399, the worst in the NFL for the period and rivalled only by [[List of Cincinnati Bengals seasons|the Cincinnati Bengals]] who went 49\u201397 over the same span.\n\n==1999 to 2001: The Greatest Show on Turf==\n{{Main|The Greatest Show on Turf}}\n\n===1999: Second Super Bowl appearance and Super Bowl champions===\n{{details|1999 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|1999\u20132000 NFL playoffs|Super Bowl XXXIV}}\nFinally in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], there appeared to be reason for hope as the Rams obtained quarterback [[Trent Green]] and running back [[Marshall Faulk]] in two separate trades. However, in the preseason Green would blow out his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and miss the entire season. A tearful Vermeil vowed that the Rams would \u201cplay good football\u201d behind Green's backup, a 28-year-old former [[Arena Football League]] [[New York Dragons|Iowa Barnstormers]] and [[NFL Europe]] [[Amsterdam Admirals]] player named [[Kurt Warner]]. However, most observers believed Green's injury set up the Rams for another long season of failure. Indeed, [[ESPN The Magazine|ESPN Magazine]] had predicted that the Rams would finish with the worst record in the league (even below that of the expansion [[History of the Cleveland Browns|Cleveland Browns]]).\n\nWarner's unexpected success was perhaps the biggest story of the 1999 NFL season. He proved to be the catalyst that would spark an explosive offense nicknamed \u201c[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\u201d, capturing the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL MVP]] award at season's end. The 1999 [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]] would go to Faulk.\n\n[[1999 St. Louis Rams season|The 1999 St. Louis Rams]] were also noted for a colorful celebration conducted by their offensive players in the [[end zone]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. The celebration, which involved a group of players standing in a circle and swaying their arms as a football spun like a top in the center of the circle, was known as the \u201cBob 'N Weave.\u201d This type of \u201cpremeditated and prolonged\u201d display was shortly thereafter subject to \u201cexcessive celebration\u201d penalties installed by the league.\n\nAfter finishing the 1999 season 13\u20133 (the franchise's second-best regular season record), the Rams started out the playoffs by defeating [[1999 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]] 49\u201337 to achieve their first NFC championship game since 1989. The opponent would be the [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who proved successful in shutting down the Rams\u2019 vaunted offense. Still, the Rams managed to win the game 11\u20136, with the one touchdown coming on Warner's 30-yard touchdown pass to [[Ricky Proehl]], who made an amazing one-handed catch. Proehl, a 10-year NFL veteran who was in the playoffs for the first time in his NFL career, said after the game \u201cThere are a lot of people who say there are 500 Ricky Proehls out there. I beg to differ.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2019 opponent in Super Bowl XXXIV would be [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|the Tennessee Titans]], who, like the Rams, had recently relocated from a major metropolis ([[Houston, Texas]]) to a mid-sized city ([[Nashville, Tennessee]]). In a game that many consider the best Super Bowl ever, Tennessee played the Rams tough throughout, achieving a 16\u201316 tie with 2:12 left on an [[Al Del Greco]] field goal. On the next drive, Warner, who had been a clutch performer all season long, came through once again, connecting with [[Isaac Bruce]] for a 73-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the drive to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead with 1:53 to play.\n\nTennessee then mounted a desperate, last-minute drive, reaching the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds left and no timeouts. Titans quarterback [[Steve McNair]] threw to [[Kevin Dyson]] on a slant. Dyson caught the pass at the 3-yard line but was stopped in a play known as \u201c[[The Tackle]]\u201d; Rams linebacker Mike Jones brought Dyson down just 18 inches shy of the goal line, ending the game and giving the Rams and coach Dick Vermeil their first Super Bowl victory. Warner was named Super Bowl MVP. Following the Rams\u2019 Super Bowl victory, Vermeil retired from football (though he came back in 2001 as head coach of [[2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]]) and was replaced by offensive coordinator (and apprentice) [[Mike Martz]].\n\n===2000: Wild card loss===\n{{details|2000 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|2000\u201301 NFL playoffs}}\nIn Mike Martz\u2019 first year as Rams head coach, the defending-champion [[2000 St. Louis Rams season|Rams]] started the season by winning their first six games as they went 7\u20131 in the [[2000 NFL season|first half of the season]]. However, their season started getting ugly. They went 3\u20135 during the last half of the season, including a three-game skid. They still managed to get into the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] with a 10\u20136 record and the NFC's #6 seed, but had to face the NFC West champion [[2000 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], the #3 seed, in the Wild Card round. Playing at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], the Rams\u2019 24th-ranked defense yielded New Orleans a 31\u20137 lead, but the Rams valiantly fought back, scoring three straight touchdowns. However, the comeback fell short as the Saints triumphed 31\u201328, the first playoff win in New Orleans franchise history.\n\n===2001: Third Super Bowl appearance===\n{{details|2001 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|Super Bowl XXXVI}}\nIn [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|\u201cMax Q\u201d Rams]] went 14\u20132 (including a spectacular 8\u20130 on the road), led not only by a sensational offense (their third straight year of scoring 500 or more points), but a good defense as well, coached by [[Lovie Smith]] and led by [[Adam Archuleta]]. After easily handling [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]] in the divisional playoffs, the Rams fought off a pesky Philadelphia Eagles team 29\u201324 to reach their second Super Bowl in three seasons. Their opponents in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] would be the [[2001 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] who, much as the Rams had had two years previous, had enjoyed a Cinderella playoff run, highlighted by [[Tuck Rule Game|a dramatic and controversial 16\u201313 divisional playoff win]] against the [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]].\n\nThe talent-laden Rams appeared to be primed to become the first professional football dynasty of the 21st century. However, despite being a 14-point favorite, the Rams were dominated by the Patriots for most of the game. The Patriots chipped the Rams wideouts and running backs, disrupting their precision passing patterns. They also beat up Kurt Warner, forcing him into uncharacteristic mistakes, including a 47-yard touchdown interception return by [[Ty Law]].\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Rams mounted a comeback attempt. Two plays after an apparent game-clinching 95-yard fumble return by the Patriots was reversed on a penalty, Kurt Warner scored on a two-yard keeper to bring the Rams to within seven points, 17\u201310. After holding the Patriots on the next drive, the Rams were in much the same situation as they had been against Tennessee. Warner came through once again, quickly leading the Rams on a dramatic drive culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl. The extra point by Jeff Wilkins tied the game at 17 with 90 seconds left.\n\nWith the Patriots holding no timeouts and the Rams having seized the momentum, overtime seemed assured. [[Fox Sports]] commentator [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] opined that the Patriots should run out the clock to end regulation time. Nevertheless, quarterback [[Tom Brady]] led the Patriots down the field, completing all but one pass (an intentional spike to stop the clock) before [[Adam Vinatieri]]\u2019s last-second 48-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] defeated the Rams 20\u201317.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVI later became part of the wider [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy]], also known as \u201cSpygate\". The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported, citing an unnamed source, that the Patriots had taped the Rams\u2019 walkthrough practice prior to the game.<ref name=\"Tomase\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1070762&srvc=home&position=0|title=Source: Pats Employee Filmed Rams |first=John|last=Tomase|work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2008-02-02|accessdate=2008-02-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080206045732/http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1070762&srvc=home&position=0| archivedate= 6 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> After further investigation, the league determined that no tape of the Rams\u2019 Super Bowl walkthrough was made,<ref name=\"GlobeMeeting\">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/05/13/meeting_between_goodell_walsh_provides_no_new_information_on_patriots_videotaping_procedures/|title=Goodell: Walsh says Pats didn't have Super Bowl walk-through tape|work=The Boston Globe|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2008-05-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121022124445/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/05/13/meeting_between_goodell_walsh_provides_no_new_information_on_patriots_videotaping_procedures/| archivedate=October 22, 2012| url-status= live}}</ref> and the ''Herald'' later issued an apology in 2008 for the article.<ref name=\"Apology\">{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1093898&srvc=home&position=0|title=Apology|work=Boston Herald|date=2008-05-14|accessdate=2008-05-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132526/http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1093898&srvc=home&position=0| archivedate= 15 May 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==2002 to 2014: Struggles==\n[[File:Marc-Bulger-Rams-vs-Jets-Nov-9-08.jpg|thumb|[[Marc Bulger]] spent several seasons as the Rams quarterback.]]\nIn [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the [[2002 St. Louis Rams season|Rams]] had a very disappointing 7\u20139 final record (after starting out 0\u20135). The silver lining was the emergence of young quarterback [[Marc Bulger]], from [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], who, after Kurt Warner was injured, won every game in which he both started and finished. Though not as intriguing a story as Warner's emergence in 1999 (the season in which Trent Green was injured and Warner became the star quarterback), Bulger's emergence was a highlight of the Rams\u2019 2002 NFL season, demonstrating Martz's knack for developing lightly regarded or overlooked players into top-quality, productive quarterbacks. Also, the Rams gained two new divisional rivals in the NFC West thanks to a league-wide realignment that created eight new divisions of four teams each. One of these new rivals, [[history of the Arizona Cardinals|the Arizona Cardinals]], played in St. Louis [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|from 1960 until the end of the 1987 season]], and the other, [[history of the Seattle Seahawks|the Seattle Seahawks]], returned to the NFC for the first time since [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|their inaugural 1976 season]].\n\nIn 2003, Warner lost the starting job to Bulger after suffering six fumbles in the season opener against [[2003 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Warner was released by the Rams in June 2004 and quickly signed a [[free agent]] contract with the Giants, effectively ending the \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d era.\n\n[[2003 NFL season|The 2003 season]] saw the Rams go 12\u20134, winning the NFC West again. However, the Rams lost a crushing divisional-round defeat to [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]] (29\u201323 in double overtime), who went on to become NFC champions.\n\nDuring the [[2004 NFL Draft]], the Rams used their first pick (24th overall) to select running back [[Steven Jackson]] from [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]].\n\nThe Rams began their 10th year in St. Louis at home, winning their home opener over [[2004 Arizona Cardinals season|the Arizona Cardinals]] 17\u201310. They then lost the next two games: to the eventual [[NFC South]] champion [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 34\u201317, and to [[2004 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] at home 28\u201325 in overtime. The Rams got to 2\u20132 on the season with a 24\u201314 road victory over [[2004 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]]. In Week 5, they defeated [[2004 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seattle Seahawks]] 33\u201327 on the road, as Bulger connected with [[Shaun McDonald]] for the 52-yard winning score in overtime. Next came a home win over Tampa Bay, 28\u201321 before a road loss to the hapless [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], 31\u201314. Following a Week 8 bye, the Rams lost to the defending champion Patriots at home 40\u201322. The Rams then downed the Seahawks 23\u201312 but then lost their next games on the road, losing to the [[Buffalo Bills]] 37\u201317 and to the eventual NFC North champion [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 45\u201317. The team rebounded with a 16\u20136 home win over the 49ers, but their playoff hopes continued to shrink with two more road losses, falling to [[2004 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]] 20\u20137 and to the Cardinals 31\u20137. At 6\u20138, the Rams rallied for home wins against [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] (20\u20137) and [[2004 New York Jets season|the New York Jets]] (32\u201329 in overtime), snatching the NFC's #5 seed despite finishing with an 8\u20138 record.\n\nFor the Wild Card round, the Rams faced the Seahawks for the third time. The visiting Rams took the lead on a 17-yard Bulger touchdown pass to [[Cam Cleeland]] with just 2:11 left in regulation time and then held off the Seahawks on 4th and goal to earn a 27\u201320 victory. The Rams made NFL history by becoming the first team to go .500 (8\u20138) in the regular season and then win a playoff game. However, St. Louis was thrashed in the divisional round by the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 47\u201317.\n\n===2005 to 2015: Playoff drought===\n[[File:Rams on offense at St. Louis at SF 11-16-08 05.JPG|thumb|right|The St. Louis Rams on offense during an away game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]]]\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Rams used their first pick on OT [[Alex Barron (football player)|Alex Barron]] from Florida State. They lost on the road in Week 1 to the 49ers, 28\u201325, but rebounded with a 17\u201312 road win over Arizona and former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner. The Rams won their Week 3 home opener against the Titans 31\u201327 before dropping three straight games. In Week 5, Martz was diagnosed with an infection in his heart, and [[Joe Vitt]] was named interim head coach. In Vitt's first game at the helm, Bulger sprained an [[Acromioclavicular joint|AC joint]] in a loss to Indianapolis. Replacement quarterback [[Jamie Martin (American football)|Jamie Martin]] then led the team to home victories against the Saints (28\u201317) and Jaguars (24\u201321). After a Week 9 bye, Bulger returned but the Rams fell in Seattle 31\u201316. The Rams next lost a rematch to the Cardinals, with Bulger suffering another shoulder injury. Against Houston, Martin was knocked out of the game with a concussion, giving rookie [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] his first playing time in the NFL. The Rams won 33\u201327 in overtime on a 56-yard touchdown strike from Fitzpatrick to receiver [[Kevin Curtis]]. However, they lost their next four games. Martin and the Rams managed to end their disastrous season on a positive note, beating Dallas on the road in [[ESPN]]\u2019s [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|final Sunday night game]]. Martz was fired at season\u2019s end.\n\nDespite having a talent-laden roster, the Rams\u2019 front-office dysfunction had traveled from [[California]] to [[Missouri]]. With team president John Shaw remaining in Los Angeles after the relocation, president of football operations Jay Zygmunt clashed with head coach Martz, including an incident in which Zygmunt prevented the ill Martz from phoning in a play to his offensive coordinator. Poor draft choices and mediocre records began to pile up for the once-budding dynasty as the post-Martz era found the Rams in chaos. Hoping to regain control within the franchise, the Rams hired former Dolphins offensive coordinator [[Scott Linehan]] as head coach on January 19, 2006.<ref>Pasquarelli, Len (Jan. 19, 2006).

In spite of his success with the Giants, Spagnuolo's first season as Rams head coach was terribly disappointing as the team went 1\u201315, beginning with a shutout at the hands of the Seahawks. The team's lone victory came in Week 8 over the 2\u201314 Detroit Lions. However, Spagnuolo was not fired after his poor first season.

In order to make room for the new QB, [[Keith Null]] and several other unproductive players were cut from the roster. The Rams lost their season opener against the Cardinals with Bradford throwing three interceptions, including one on the last play of the game. They recorded their first win by beating Washington and ending a 14-game home-losing streak in Week 3. In Week 4, the Rams ended a 10-game losing streak against Seattle, 20\u20133. After being trounced 44\u20136 by Detroit, they returned home in Week 6 to beat San Diego 20\u201317. Bradford continued to show promise through the season despite struggling from his inexperience. Despite a 7\u20138 record, the Rams had a chance to win the NFC West when they traveled to 6\u20139 Seattle for a [[Prime time|prime-time]] matchup. However, the Seahawks won the game and the division, 16\u20136. Bradford went on to win the 2010 Offensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe 2011 season started disastrously, with the Rams opening 0\u20136, finally winning an improbable victory over the Saints in Week 8. The team finished 2\u201314, with their only other win being a Week 10 victory over Cleveland. Bradford missed half the season with an ankle injury, and the Rams\u2019 offense was rated the worst in the league.\n\nAt the conclusion of a poor 2011, [[Steve Spagnulo|Spagnulo]] and nearly all of the coaching staff were fired except offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]], who was asked by the [[New England Patriots]] to return during the playoffs (he had been an assistant coach there prior to his disastrous stint as [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|Denver Broncos head coach]] in 2009). The Rams then hired head coach [[Jeff Fisher]], who had led the Tennessee Titans in their [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] loss to the Rams 12 years earlier. Fisher would then influence the hiring of new GM Les Snead and an all-new coaching staff including offensive coordinator [[Brian Schottenheimer]] and defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]]. Williams was eventually suspended for the entire 2012 season for his part in the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|Saints bounty scandal]].\n\nDespite the 2011 fiasco, the Rams continued with their plans to rebuild the team around Bradford and convinced the Redskins to give up two first-round draft picks and one second-round draft pick in exchange for the Rams\u2019 #2 overall pick. This moved the Rams down to the #6 pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], which they in turn traded to Dallas, but were left with an abundance of others for future use. Following the draft, they signed undrafted Oregon State punter [[Johnny Hekker]], who would become a [[Pro Bowl]]-caliber player.\n\nThe Rams started 2012 with low hopes, but the draft trade with Washington confirmed Bradford would be their quarterback of the future. The team then surprised some by starting off 3\u20132, their first winning record since 2006. They then lost three straight, but rebounded with a solid 4\u20134\u20131 finish, including a 24\u201324 road tie with eventual NFC champion San Francisco, to finish 7\u20138\u20131, a five-game improvement over 2011 and an impressive 4\u20131\u20131 record in the very competitive NFC West.\n\nIn 2013, the Rams finished with a 7\u20139 record. In the 2014 season, their 20th in St. Louis, the team would again miss the playoffs with a 6\u201310 record. Bradford missed the entire 2014 season with an injury, allowing [[Shaun Hill]] and [[Austin Davis]] opportunities at quarterback.\n\n==2015: Nick Foles and the final season in St. Louis==\nOn March 10, 2015, the Rams were involved in a rare trade of starting quarterbacks as they traded Bradford along with a fifth-round pick in 2015 to [[2015 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for the Eagles' [[Nick Foles]] along with a fourth-round pick in 2015 and a second round pick in 2016. Foles had a 14\u20134 record as starter and an impressive TD\u2013INT ratio of 46\u201317, while Bradford had an 18\u201330\u20131 record. On the day of the 2015 draft the Rams traded [[Zac Stacy]], the Rams\u2019 2013 rushing leader, for a 7th round pick to the Jets.\n\nThe Rams opened their 2015 season at home against Seattle. In Foles\u2019 Rams debut, he threw for 297 yards and a touchdown. Following the dramatic win, Foles struggled against his former divisional rival, the Redskins as the Rams lost 24\u201310. Foles' accuracy improved the following week but he threw no touchdowns and his first interception as a Ram against the Steelers, dropping the team to 1\u20132. Following the two losses Foles bounced back, handing the unbeaten Cardinals their first loss of the season. After that game, Foles\u2019 problems with turnovers from 2014 started to show, as he completed 11 passes out of 30 for 141 yards, 1 touchdown, and a career-high 4 interceptions against the Green Bay Packers. On November 16, Foles was benched in favor of [[Case Keenum]], who would start the remainder of the season.\n\n===Todd Gurley\u2019s arrival and the beginning of Jared Goff===\nLeading the team through their turbulence was rookie RB [[Todd Gurley]]. Gurley was drafted 10th overall in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2015/04/30/st-louis-rams-select-Todd-Gurley-2015-nfl-draft |title=St. Louis Rams select Todd Gurley No. 10 in 2015 NFL draft |first=Chris|last=Burke|work=Sports Illustrated|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref> Gurley, who tore his ACL in November 2014,  saw his rehabilitation go ahead of schedule and during the team's preseason, while he did not play, he practiced without pads on. Soon after, Gurley was medically cleared for full contact by St. Louis team physicians. On Sept 27, 2015, he made his NFL debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was eased into action and finished the game with 6 rushes for 9 yards. The following week, the Rams visited undefeated Arizona for an NFC west divisional matchup. Again Gurley started slow with just 2 yards at halftime, but rushed for 144 yards in the second half as the Rams edged the Cardinals 24\u201322. The next three games against the Packers, Browns, and 49ers would see Gurley rush for at least 128 rushing yards per game. He scored his first NFL touchdown on Oct 25th, 2015 against the Cleveland Browns. With 566 yards in his first four NFL starts, Gurley became the most prolific rusher in his first four NFL games since the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14028672/todd-gurley-st-louis-rams-sets-yardage-mark-first-four-starts-career|title=Todd Gurley sets mark for most yards in first four starts |first=Nick|last=Wagoner|publisher=\"ESPN\"|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref> In Week 15, Gurley became the third rookie in Rams history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season after [[Jerome Bettis]] and [[Eric Dickerson]] in the Rams 31\u201323 victory over the Buccaneers. and in their 23\u201317 victory over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and becoming the second Rams rookie to rush for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns since Eric Dickerson in 1983.\n\nThe Rams played their final home game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], on December 17, 2015. While the Edward Jones Dome was not at sell out capacity, a sizeable group of Rams fans attended the game, holding signs that read \u201cKeep the Rams in St. Louis.\u201d Enthusiastic chants of \u201cKeep the Rams\u201d and \u201cKroenke Sucks\u201d were heard during and after the game. Despite offensive production from Tampa Bay, the Rams still managed a 31\u201323 victory with [[Case Keenum]] throwing for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns, Todd Gurley rushing 48 yards, [[Tavon Austin]] rushing 32 yards and a touchdown, [[Kenny Britt]] receiving for 71 yards and 1 touchdown, and [[Jared Cook]] receiving for 64 yards. The Rams offense dominated this game as well the defense also put pressure on the Buccaneers quarterback [[Jameis Winston]].\n\nOn December 22, 2015, [[Todd Gurley]] along with fellow Rams players [[Aaron Donald]] and [[Johnny Hekker]]  were selected to be part of the [[2016 Pro Bowl]]. Gurley was one of three rookies to be selected to the Pro Bowl, along with [[2015 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] [[cornerback]] [[Marcus Peters]] and [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] [[wide receiver]] and [[Kickoff returner|kick returner]] [[Tyler Lockett]].\nThe Rams concluded their season with two road games in the West, winning 23\u201317 against the Seahawks and losing 19\u201316 in overtime against the 49ers. Overall, the team finished their final season in St. Louis with a 7\u20139 record.\n\n==Stadium problems; return relocation to Los Angeles==\n{{main|Edward Jones Dome#Future}}\n{{NFL Rams history}}\n\n===Stadium issues in St. Louis===\nThe Rams and the St. Louis CVC began negotiating a deal to get the Rams\u2019 home stadium, the [[Edward Jones Dome]], into the top 25 percent of stadiums in the league (i.e., top eight of 32 NFL teams, in reference to luxury boxes, amenities and overall fan experience).  Under the terms of the lease agreement, the St. Louis CVC was required to make modifications to the Edward Jones Dome in 2005.  However, then-owner Georgia Frontiere waived this provision, in exchange for cash that served as a penalty for the city's noncompliance.  The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, did make changes to the scoreboard and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remained dark.  The minor renovations which totaled about $70 million did not bring the stadium within the specifications required under the lease agreement, thus keeping the Dome in a state of uncertainty.\nOn February 1, 2013, a three-panel arbitrator selected to preside over the arbitration process found that the Edward Jones Dome was not in the top 25 percent of all NFL venues, as required under the terms of the lease agreement between the Rams and the CVC.  The arbitrator further found that the estimated $700 million in proposed renovations by the Rams was not unreasonable, given the terms of the lease agreement.  Finally, the [[City of St. Louis]] was ordered to pay the Rams\u2019 attorney fees which totaled a reported $2 million. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nPublicly, no interest was expressed by city, county and state officials in providing further funding to the Edward Jones Dome, in light of those entities (and taxpayers) continuing to owe approximately $300 million on the facility.  A resolution was not reached by the end of the [[2014 NFL season]]; therefore, with the City of St. Louis remaining in non-compliance with its obligations under the lease agreement, the Rams were free to nullify the lease and change to a year-to-year lease. Months later, the Rams scheduled a game to be played in [[London]], violating the Edward Jones Dome's terms of lease. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====National Car Rental Field proposal====\n{{main|National Car Rental Field}}\nIn an effort to try to keep the team in St. Louis, a multipurpose stadium, [[National Car Rental Field]], was proposed in 2015, estimated to cost $1.1 billion. The initial proposal called for the stadium to be paid for by a combination of $250 million from Rams, a $200 million loan from the NFL, $130 million from personal seat license sales, $55 million in tax credits and other public incentives, $350 million from extending the state bonds originally issued for the construction of the Edward Jones Dome.<ref name=financing>{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Tim|title=Edward Jones Dome authority to seek state tax credits|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/edward-jones-dome-authority-to-seek-state-tax-credits/article_262eb5e4-0704-58ff-bad3-5c6f2dd6fd59.html|website=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn January 9, 2016, the NFL distributed a report to team owners calling the St. Louis stadium plan \"unsatisfactory and inadequate\" to keep the Rams in St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|last2=Fenno|first2=Nathan|title=Roger Goodell says NFL stadium proposals are not viable in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-nfl-la-stadium-20160110-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n====City of Champions Revitilization Initiative; Los Angeles Entertainment Center====\n{{main|SoFi Stadium}}\nOn January 31, 2014, both the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' reported that Rams owner Stan Kroenke purchased approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the [[The Forum (Inglewood)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]] for a purchase price rumored to be between $90 million and $100 million.  Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Mr. Kroenke informed the league of the purchase.  As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. Kroenke subsequently announced plans to build an NFL stadium on the site, in connection with the owners of the adjacent 238-acre Hollywood Park site, Stockbridge Capital Group.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\"/> This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California.  The land had been originally intended for a Walmart Supercenter, but [[Walmart]] could not get the necessary permits to build it.  Kroenke is married to [[Ann Walton Kroenke]], who is a member of the [[Walton family]], and many of Kroenke's real estate deals have involved Walmart properties.\n\nOn January 5, 2015, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Stan Kroenke and [[Stockbridge Capital Group]] were partnering up to develop a new NFL stadium on the [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] property owned by Kroenke. The project includes a stadium of 80,000 seats, and a performance venue of 6,000 seats, while reconfiguring the previously approved [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] plan for up to 890,000 square feet of retail, 780,000 square feet of office space, 2,500 new residential units, a 300-room hotel and 25 acres of public parks, playgrounds, open space and pedestrian and bicycle access.

They were among three teams (the others being the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[L.A. Chargers|San Diego Chargers]]) that had filed for relocation to Los Angeles. All three franchises had previously played in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. Weeks later, the NFL owners gathered in Houston for a meeting on January 12 to decide which teams, if any, would win relocation rights to Los Angeles. A few days before the scheduled owners meeting, [[Dallas Cowboys]] owner [[Jerry Jones]] suggested that the Rams and Chargers share Stan Kroenke's [[SoFi Stadium|Los Angeles Entertainment Center]]. This suggestion was taken as a possible option discussed in the Houston meetings. During the Los Angeles meeting, the Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, which consists of six NFL owners, favored the Carson project over the Rams\u2019 Inglewood project. However, in the first round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got the greater number of votes (21) while the Carson project received far fewer (11). This, however, did not meet the required threshold of 24 votes. In the second round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got 20 votes while the Carson proposal got 12. After hours of trying to reach a compromise, the Rams succeeded and announced their relocation to Los Angeles, effectively ending the team's 21-year tenure in St. Louis. The Chargers organization was given the first option to join the Rams after a year (if they failed to reach a new stadium deal with the city of San Diego); the Chargers exercised this option on January 12, 2017, making Los Angeles home to two NFL franchises again. (Had the Chargers declined to exercise this option, then the Raiders would have had this option).<ref>{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Rams to relocate to L.A.; Chargers first option to join|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000621645/article/rams-to-relocate-to-la-chargers-first-option-to-join|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rams to Return to Los Angeles|url=http://www.therams.com/news-and-events/article-1/Rams-to-Return-to-Los-Angeles/802b4e16-671e-4864-97b6-943115cdc4cf|publisher=St. Louis Rams|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120221040/http://www.therams.com/news-and-events/article-1/Rams-to-Return-to-Los-Angeles/802b4e16-671e-4864-97b6-943115cdc4cf|archive-date=January 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Season Results==\n===Key===\n*''The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.

That was the last year that the [[Arizona Cardinals|now-Arizona Cardinals]] played there before moving to [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] in 1988. The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history; the team previously called Cleveland, Ohio home until 1946.\n\nThe Rams played their home games at what is now known as [[The Dome at America's Center]] in downtown St. Louis, which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team. The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the [[New England Patriots]] was forced out of power by their stadium's owner and operator.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri, so they were forced to temporarily share [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Their first game in St. Louis against [[1995 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] was played on September 10, 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13. The then- [[Trans World Airlines|Trans World]] Dome opened on November 12, 1995 with the home team scoring a 28\u201317 victory against [[1995 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]]. \n\nThe Rams' last game played in St. Louis, in what was by then known as the [[Edward Jones Dome]], was against [[2015 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|the Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31\u201323. The Rams\u2019 last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at [[Levi's Stadium]], when they lost in overtime 19\u201316. Following the 2015 NFL season, the team returned to Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the Rams' tenure in St. Louis, the franchise won its first and, to date, only [[Super Bowl]] title in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] and made a second appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]]. Assisted by [[the Greatest Show on Turf]] offense, the Rams enjoyed their greatest period of success from [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|1999]] to [[2003 St. Louis Rams season|2003]], but struggled throughout their remaining years in St. Louis. Upon their relocation back to Los Angeles, the Rams had gone twelve seasons without obtaining a winning record and eleven seasons without qualifying for the postseason.\n\n==Origins==\n{{main|History of the Cleveland Rams|History of the Los Angeles Rams}}\n\n===Cardinals move to Arizona and begin new approach===\n{{further|History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)}}\nFor 22 of their 28 years the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] called [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] home after it opened in 1966, after spending their first six seasons in St. Louis at [[Sportsman's Park]]; they shared both stadiums with [[St. Louis Cardinals|the baseball team of the same name]]. However, the overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with stadium issues,<ref>Kiley, Mike; \u2018New Stadium at Issue in St. Louis, Too\u2019; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', June 22, 1987, p. 7</ref> caused game attendance to dwindle. Consequently, the Bidwills, the family that owned the Cardinals, decided to move the team for a second time after having relocated the franchise from [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago]] to St. Louis in 1960. The cities the Bidwills considered included [[Baltimore]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[New York City]], and [[Jacksonville]], whilst [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] also made overtures without Bidwell considering them.<ref>Asher, Mark; \u2018Cardinals Owner Seen Leaning to Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 24, 1987, p. E01</ref> Nonetheless, Cardinals fans were unhappy at losing their team,<ref>Litsky, Frank; \u2018Cardinals Struggle Before Empty Seats\u2019; ''New York Times''; December 10, 1987, p. D1</ref> and [[Bill Bidwill]], fearing for his safety, stayed away from several of the 1987 home games. The Cardinals\u2019 final home game in St. Louis was on December 13, 1987, which they won 27\u201324 over [[1987 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in front of 29,623 fans on a late Sunday afternoon.\n\nNot long after the 1987 season, Bidwill agreed to move to the [[Phoenix area]] on a handshake deal with state and local officials,<ref>\u2018Football Cardinals Settle on Phoenix\u2019; ''[[New York Times]]'', January 16, 1988, p. 47</ref> and the team became [[History of the Arizona Cardinals|the Phoenix Cardinals]]. They planned to play at [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State University]]\u2019s [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] on a temporary basis while a new stadium was being built. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, the [[savings and loan crisis]] derailed financing for the stadium, forcing the Cardinals to play at Arizona State for 18 years. The team changed its name to the Arizona Cardinals for [[1994 Arizona Cardinals season|the 1994 season]].\n\n==== The move to Anaheim ====\nPrior to the Rams\u2019 [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|1979 Super Bowl season]], owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] drowned in an accident. His widow, [[Georgia Frontiere]], inherited 70% ownership of the team. Frontiere fired her step-son, Steve Rosenbloom, and assumed total control of the franchise. As had been planned prior to Carroll Rosenbloom's death, the Rams moved from their longtime home at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in nearby [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in 1980. The move was necessitated in part by the fact that the Coliseum was difficult to sell out because of its abnormally large [[seating capacity]] (100,000),<ref>Riess, Steven A.; ''Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century: An Encyclopedia'', p. 754 {{ISBN|1317459474}}</ref> subjecting the team to the league's local-market TV [[NFL blackout|blackout rule]], whenever home games did not sell out. Also, Southern California's population patterns were changing; there was rapid growth in L.A.\u2019s affluent suburbs (e.g. greater Orange County) and a decline in the city of Los Angeles\u2019 citizenship and earning power.<ref name=\"shopping\">Stellino, Vito; \u2018Rams\u2019 shopping bag is filled with NFL frustration\u2019; ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', November 25, 1993, p. 1D</ref> Anaheim Stadium was originally built in 1966 as the home of the [[History of the Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]] Major League Baseball franchise. To accommodate the Rams\u2019 move, the ballpark was reconfigured with luxury suites and enclosed to accommodate crowds of about 65,000 for football.\n\nIn 1982 the Coliseum was occupied by the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] (now the [[History of the Oakland Raiders|Oakland Raiders]] and from 2020 the [[Las Vegas Raiders]]). The combined effect of these two factors was to force the Rams\u2019 traditional fan base to be split between two teams. Making matters even worse, at this time the Rams were unsuccessful on the field, while the Raiders were thriving \u2014 even winning [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1983. Meanwhile, [[List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons|the Los Angeles Lakers]] won [[NBA Finals|championships]] in 1980 and 1982 en route to winning five titles in that decade, [[List of Los Angeles Dodgers seasons|the Los Angeles Dodgers]] won the [[World Series]] in 1981 and 1988, and [[List of Los Angeles Kings seasons|the Los Angeles Kings]], buoyed by the acquisition of [[Wayne Gretzky]] in August 1988, advanced to the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\n===1990\u201394: Frontiere\u2019s end game for the L.A. Rams===\nAlthough not apparent at the time, the Rams\u2019 loss in the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|1989 NFC Championship Game]] marked the end of an era. The Rams would not have another winning season in Los Angeles before relocation. The first half of the 1990s featured four straight 10-loss (or worse) seasons, no playoff appearances and waning fan interest. The return of [[Chuck Knox]] as head coach after successful stints as head coach of [[List of Buffalo Bills seasons|the Buffalo Bills]] and [[List of Seattle Seahawks seasons|Seattle Seahawks]] would not boost the Rams\u2019 fortunes. Knox's run-oriented offense brought about the end of offensive coordinator [[Ernie Zampese]]\u2019s tenure in 1993. General manager John Shaw was perceived by some to continually squander [[NFL Draft]] picks on sub-standard talent. The offensive scheme was not only unspectacular to watch, but dull by 1990s standards, further alienating fans. One bright spot for the offense during this time would be running back [[Jerome Bettis]], a bruising running back from Notre Dame. Bettis flourished in Knox\u2019s offense, running for 1,429 yards as a rookie and 1,025 in his sophomore effort.\n\nAs early as the close [[1992 Los Angeles Rams season|of the 1992 season]], Georgia Frontiere announced she wanted to break the Rams\u2019 lease of Anaheim Stadium.<ref>Shaffer, Gina; \u2018Pasadena, Los Angeles looking into bids for Rams: The field of potential rivals for the team widens after Rams officials announce their intention to break their lease\u2019; ''[[Orange County Register]]'', January 11, 1933, p. B08</ref> After the 1993 season, Frontiere attempted to move the Rams to Baltimore,<ref>\u2018Frontiere Might Move Rams to Baltimore\u2019; ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'', December 25, 1993, p. E3</ref> but her fellow owners turned that proposal down. Frontiere then sought to relocate the team to [[St. Louis]]. This move was initially voted down as well, with 21 opposed, 3 in favor (the Rams, [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]), and 6 abstaining.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/sports/pro-football-nfl-owners-reject-rams-bid-to-move-to-st-louis.html | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=George | title=PRO FOOTBALL; N.F.L.

As part of the relocation deal, the city of St. Louis agreed to build a taxpayer-financed stadium, the [[The Dome at America's Center|Trans World Dome]], and guaranteed that the stadium's amenities would be maintained in the top 25% of all NFL stadiums. Frontiere waived the clause after a 10-year threshold period passed, as the city implemented a later plan to improve the stadium.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-13/news/mn-54268_1_rams-owner | title=NFL Owners OK Rams\u2019 Move to St. Louis | author=T.J. Simers | date=April 13, 1995 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe move left many in the [[Los Angeles area]], and many of those indifferent to the whole situation, embittered toward the NFL. That sentiment was best expressed by actor and ex-Ram [[Fred Dryer]], who at the time said \u201cI hate these people [the organization and its owner] for what they did, taking the Rams logo with them when they moved to St. Louis. That logo belonged to Southern California.\u201d Steve Rosenbloom, general manager of the team during his father's tenure as owner, opined that teams come and go, but for a team to leave Los Angeles \u2014 the second largest media market in America \u2014 for St. Louis (approximately the 18th-largest) was simply irresponsible and foolish, in spite of the notoriously fickle support of Los Angeles fans. With the Raiders moving from L.A. back to Oakland only a few months later, the NFL would have no franchise in Los Angeles for two decades, although the Coliseum was used for professional football in 2001 by the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] of the now-defunct [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].\n\n==First years (1995 to 1998)==\nWhile the Rams dealt with stadium concerns in Los Angeles, efforts were under way to regain an NFL franchise in St. Louis to play in a new domed stadium slated to open in 1995. First, [[Anheuser-Busch]] scion [[James Orthwein|Jim Orthwein]] tried, and ultimately failed, to move [[History of the New England Patriots|the New England Patriots]] to St. Louis. Then, despite being heavily favored along with [[Charlotte]] to win an expansion team, St. Louis lost to a group from [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. So certain, in fact, did it appear that St. Louis would gain an expansion franchise, that the team had a name selected \u2013 [[St. Louis Stallions|the Stallions]] \u2013 and T-shirts with the team's logo were made very briefly available for sale at a number of St. Louis area sports shops.\n\nJust before moving to St. Louis, the Rams fired Knox and hired [[Rich Brooks]], longtime successful football coach at [[Oregon Ducks football|the University of Oregon]], to replace him. The team played its first several games in St. Louis at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] (the home of the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals from 1966 until 1987) as work finished on their new home, the Trans World Dome. Brooks jettisoned Knox's run-oriented scheme in favor of a powerful air attack. Bettis all but disappeared from the offense, rushing for only 637 yards. Despite this, the Rams started off well, getting off to a 5\u20131 start. However, a 44\u201310 thumping by the 49ers in the last game at Busch Stadium sent the team into a downward spiral, and they ultimately finished 7\u20139 \u2014 still the franchise's closest to \u201ccontention\u201d since 1989. Perhaps the most memorable aspect was that veteran offensive lineman and future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jackie Slater]] played his 20th and final season with the team in its new St. Louis location.\n\n===Vermeil era===\nThe next three seasons would largely be a repeat of the Rams\u2019 last five seasons in Los Angeles. The team drafted highly touted [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] running back [[Lawrence Phillips]] with the sixth overall pick in the [[1996 NFL Draft]], making Bettis expendable. Bettis would be traded to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in exchange for draft picks, a move now seen as one of the most lopsided trades in professional sports history, strongly favoring the Steelers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap2000000336962|title=Top 15 trades in NFL history|work=NFL.com|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> After regressing to 6\u201310 in 1996, Brooks was replaced by [[Dick Vermeil]]. Vermeil had enjoyed success as the head coach of [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] (where he won a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]]) and [[List of Philadelphia Eagles seasons|the Philadelphia Eagles]], whom he had led to [[Super Bowl XV]]. However, Vermeil left the Eagles after an unsuccessful [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], claiming burnout, and proceeded to spend much of the next decade and a half as a college football commentator for [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]].\n\nVermeil's first two seasons as Rams coach were as unsuccessful as many of the preceding seasons. Phillips was cut from the team mid-season in 1997, cementing his status as a [[Draft (sports)#Other terminology|draft bust]].\n\nThe Rams\u2019 struggles continued in 1998. At the close of that season the franchise had suffered a nine-season streak in which the team compiled a dismal record of 45\u201399, the worst in the NFL for the period and rivalled only by [[List of Cincinnati Bengals seasons|the Cincinnati Bengals]] who went 49\u201397 over the same span.\n\n==1999 to 2001: The Greatest Show on Turf==\n{{Main|The Greatest Show on Turf}}\n\n===1999: Second Super Bowl appearance and Super Bowl champions===\n{{details|1999 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|1999\u20132000 NFL playoffs|Super Bowl XXXIV}}\nFinally in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], there appeared to be reason for hope as the Rams obtained quarterback [[Trent Green]] and running back [[Marshall Faulk]] in two separate trades. However, in the preseason Green would blow out his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and miss the entire season. A tearful Vermeil vowed that the Rams would \u201cplay good football\u201d behind Green's backup, a 28-year-old former [[Arena Football League]] [[New York Dragons|Iowa Barnstormers]] and [[NFL Europe]] [[Amsterdam Admirals]] player named [[Kurt Warner]]. However, most observers believed Green's injury set up the Rams for another long season of failure. Indeed, [[ESPN The Magazine|ESPN Magazine]] had predicted that the Rams would finish with the worst record in the league (even below that of the expansion [[History of the Cleveland Browns|Cleveland Browns]]).\n\nWarner's unexpected success was perhaps the biggest story of the 1999 NFL season. He proved to be the catalyst that would spark an explosive offense nicknamed \u201c[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\u201d, capturing the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL MVP]] award at season's end. The 1999 [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]] would go to Faulk.\n\n[[1999 St. Louis Rams season|The 1999 St. Louis Rams]] were also noted for a colorful celebration conducted by their offensive players in the [[end zone]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. The celebration, which involved a group of players standing in a circle and swaying their arms as a football spun like a top in the center of the circle, was known as the \u201cBob 'N Weave.\u201d This type of \u201cpremeditated and prolonged\u201d display was shortly thereafter subject to \u201cexcessive celebration\u201d penalties installed by the league.\n\nAfter finishing the 1999 season 13\u20133 (the franchise's second-best regular season record), the Rams started out the playoffs by defeating [[1999 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]] 49\u201337 to achieve their first NFC championship game since 1989. The opponent would be the [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who proved successful in shutting down the Rams\u2019 vaunted offense. Still, the Rams managed to win the game 11\u20136, with the one touchdown coming on Warner's 30-yard touchdown pass to [[Ricky Proehl]], who made an amazing one-handed catch. Proehl, a 10-year NFL veteran who was in the playoffs for the first time in his NFL career, said after the game \u201cThere are a lot of people who say there are 500 Ricky Proehls out there. I beg to differ.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2019 opponent in Super Bowl XXXIV would be [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|the Tennessee Titans]], who, like the Rams, had recently relocated from a major metropolis ([[Houston, Texas]]) to a mid-sized city ([[Nashville, Tennessee]]). In a game that many consider the best Super Bowl ever, Tennessee played the Rams tough throughout, achieving a 16\u201316 tie with 2:12 left on an [[Al Del Greco]] field goal. On the next drive, Warner, who had been a clutch performer all season long, came through once again, connecting with [[Isaac Bruce]] for a 73-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the drive to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead with 1:53 to play.\n\nTennessee then mounted a desperate, last-minute drive, reaching the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds left and no timeouts. Titans quarterback [[Steve McNair]] threw to [[Kevin Dyson]] on a slant. Dyson caught the pass at the 3-yard line but was stopped in a play known as \u201c[[The Tackle]]\u201d; Rams linebacker Mike Jones brought Dyson down just 18 inches shy of the goal line, ending the game and giving the Rams and coach Dick Vermeil their first Super Bowl victory. Warner was named Super Bowl MVP. Following the Rams\u2019 Super Bowl victory, Vermeil retired from football (though he came back in 2001 as head coach of [[2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]]) and was replaced by offensive coordinator (and apprentice) [[Mike Martz]].\n\n===2000: Wild card loss===\n{{details|2000 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|2000\u201301 NFL playoffs}}\nIn Mike Martz\u2019 first year as Rams head coach, the defending-champion [[2000 St. Louis Rams season|Rams]] started the season by winning their first six games as they went 7\u20131 in the [[2000 NFL season|first half of the season]]. However, their season started getting ugly. They went 3\u20135 during the last half of the season, including a three-game skid. They still managed to get into the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] with a 10\u20136 record and the NFC's #6 seed, but had to face the NFC West champion [[2000 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], the #3 seed, in the Wild Card round. Playing at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], the Rams\u2019 24th-ranked defense yielded New Orleans a 31\u20137 lead, but the Rams valiantly fought back, scoring three straight touchdowns. However, the comeback fell short as the Saints triumphed 31\u201328, the first playoff win in New Orleans franchise history.\n\n===2001: Third Super Bowl appearance===\n{{details|2001 St. Louis Rams season}}\n{{further|2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|Super Bowl XXXVI}}\nIn [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|\u201cMax Q\u201d Rams]] went 14\u20132 (including a spectacular 8\u20130 on the road), led not only by a sensational offense (their third straight year of scoring 500 or more points), but a good defense as well, coached by [[Lovie Smith]] and led by [[Adam Archuleta]]. After easily handling [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]] in the divisional playoffs, the Rams fought off a pesky Philadelphia Eagles team 29\u201324 to reach their second Super Bowl in three seasons. Their opponents in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] would be the [[2001 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] who, much as the Rams had had two years previous, had enjoyed a Cinderella playoff run, highlighted by [[Tuck Rule Game|a dramatic and controversial 16\u201313 divisional playoff win]] against the [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]].\n\nThe talent-laden Rams appeared to be primed to become the first professional football dynasty of the 21st century. However, despite being a 14-point favorite, the Rams were dominated by the Patriots for most of the game. The Patriots chipped the Rams wideouts and running backs, disrupting their precision passing patterns. They also beat up Kurt Warner, forcing him into uncharacteristic mistakes, including a 47-yard touchdown interception return by [[Ty Law]].\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Rams mounted a comeback attempt. Two plays after an apparent game-clinching 95-yard fumble return by the Patriots was reversed on a penalty, Kurt Warner scored on a two-yard keeper to bring the Rams to within seven points, 17\u201310. After holding the Patriots on the next drive, the Rams were in much the same situation as they had been against Tennessee. Warner came through once again, quickly leading the Rams on a dramatic drive culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl. The extra point by Jeff Wilkins tied the game at 17 with 90 seconds left.\n\nWith the Patriots holding no timeouts and the Rams having seized the momentum, overtime seemed assured. [[Fox Sports]] commentator [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] opined that the Patriots should run out the clock to end regulation time. Nevertheless, quarterback [[Tom Brady]] led the Patriots down the field, completing all but one pass (an intentional spike to stop the clock) before [[Adam Vinatieri]]\u2019s last-second 48-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] defeated the Rams 20\u201317.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVI later became part of the wider [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy]], also known as \u201cSpygate\". The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported, citing an unnamed source, that the Patriots had taped the Rams\u2019 walkthrough practice prior to the game.<ref name=\"Tomase\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1070762&srvc=home&position=0|title=Source: Pats Employee Filmed Rams |first=John|last=Tomase|work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2008-02-02|accessdate=2008-02-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080206045732/http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1070762&srvc=home&position=0| archivedate= 6 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> After further investigation, the league determined that no tape of the Rams\u2019 Super Bowl walkthrough was made,<ref name=\"GlobeMeeting\">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/05/13/meeting_between_goodell_walsh_provides_no_new_information_on_patriots_videotaping_procedures/|title=Goodell: Walsh says Pats didn't have Super Bowl walk-through tape|work=The Boston Globe|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2008-05-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121022124445/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/05/13/meeting_between_goodell_walsh_provides_no_new_information_on_patriots_videotaping_procedures/| archivedate=October 22, 2012| url-status= live}}</ref> and the ''Herald'' later issued an apology in 2008 for the article.<ref name=\"Apology\">{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1093898&srvc=home&position=0|title=Apology|work=Boston Herald|date=2008-05-14|accessdate=2008-05-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515132526/http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1093898&srvc=home&position=0| archivedate= 15 May 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==2002 to 2014: Struggles==\n[[File:Marc-Bulger-Rams-vs-Jets-Nov-9-08.jpg|thumb|[[Marc Bulger]] spent several seasons as the Rams quarterback.]]\nIn [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the [[2002 St. Louis Rams season|Rams]] had a very disappointing 7\u20139 final record (after starting out 0\u20135). The silver lining was the emergence of young quarterback [[Marc Bulger]], from [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], who, after Kurt Warner was injured, won every game in which he both started and finished. Though not as intriguing a story as Warner's emergence in 1999 (the season in which Trent Green was injured and Warner became the star quarterback), Bulger's emergence was a highlight of the Rams\u2019 2002 NFL season, demonstrating Martz's knack for developing lightly regarded or overlooked players into top-quality, productive quarterbacks. Also, the Rams gained two new divisional rivals in the NFC West thanks to a league-wide realignment that created eight new divisions of four teams each. One of these new rivals, [[history of the Arizona Cardinals|the Arizona Cardinals]], played in St. Louis [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|from 1960 until the end of the 1987 season]], and the other, [[history of the Seattle Seahawks|the Seattle Seahawks]], returned to the NFC for the first time since [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|their inaugural 1976 season]].\n\nIn 2003, Warner lost the starting job to Bulger after suffering six fumbles in the season opener against [[2003 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Warner was released by the Rams in June 2004 and quickly signed a [[free agent]] contract with the Giants, effectively ending the \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d era.\n\n[[2003 NFL season|The 2003 season]] saw the Rams go 12\u20134, winning the NFC West again. However, the Rams lost a crushing divisional-round defeat to [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]] (29\u201323 in double overtime), who went on to become NFC champions.\n\nDuring the [[2004 NFL Draft]], the Rams used their first pick (24th overall) to select running back [[Steven Jackson]] from [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]].\n\nThe Rams began their 10th year in St. Louis at home, winning their home opener over [[2004 Arizona Cardinals season|the Arizona Cardinals]] 17\u201310. They then lost the next two games: to the eventual [[NFC South]] champion [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 34\u201317, and to [[2004 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] at home 28\u201325 in overtime. The Rams got to 2\u20132 on the season with a 24\u201314 road victory over [[2004 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]]. In Week 5, they defeated [[2004 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seattle Seahawks]] 33\u201327 on the road, as Bulger connected with [[Shaun McDonald]] for the 52-yard winning score in overtime. Next came a home win over Tampa Bay, 28\u201321 before a road loss to the hapless [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], 31\u201314. Following a Week 8 bye, the Rams lost to the defending champion Patriots at home 40\u201322. The Rams then downed the Seahawks 23\u201312 but then lost their next games on the road, losing to the [[Buffalo Bills]] 37\u201317 and to the eventual NFC North champion [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 45\u201317. The team rebounded with a 16\u20136 home win over the 49ers, but their playoff hopes continued to shrink with two more road losses, falling to [[2004 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]] 20\u20137 and to the Cardinals 31\u20137. At 6\u20138, the Rams rallied for home wins against [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] (20\u20137) and [[2004 New York Jets season|the New York Jets]] (32\u201329 in overtime), snatching the NFC's #5 seed despite finishing with an 8\u20138 record.\n\nFor the Wild Card round, the Rams faced the Seahawks for the third time. The visiting Rams took the lead on a 17-yard Bulger touchdown pass to [[Cam Cleeland]] with just 2:11 left in regulation time and then held off the Seahawks on 4th and goal to earn a 27\u201320 victory. The Rams made NFL history by becoming the first team to go .500 (8\u20138) in the regular season and then win a playoff game. However, St. Louis was thrashed in the divisional round by the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 47\u201317.\n\n===2005 to 2015: Playoff drought===\n[[File:Rams on offense at St. Louis at SF 11-16-08 05.JPG|thumb|right|The St. Louis Rams on offense during an away game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]]]\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Rams used their first pick on OT [[Alex Barron (football player)|Alex Barron]] from Florida State. They lost on the road in Week 1 to the 49ers, 28\u201325, but rebounded with a 17\u201312 road win over Arizona and former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner. The Rams won their Week 3 home opener against the Titans 31\u201327 before dropping three straight games. In Week 5, Martz was diagnosed with an infection in his heart, and [[Joe Vitt]] was named interim head coach. In Vitt's first game at the helm, Bulger sprained an [[Acromioclavicular joint|AC joint]] in a loss to Indianapolis. Replacement quarterback [[Jamie Martin (American football)|Jamie Martin]] then led the team to home victories against the Saints (28\u201317) and Jaguars (24\u201321). After a Week 9 bye, Bulger returned but the Rams fell in Seattle 31\u201316. The Rams next lost a rematch to the Cardinals, with Bulger suffering another shoulder injury. Against Houston, Martin was knocked out of the game with a concussion, giving rookie [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] his first playing time in the NFL. The Rams won 33\u201327 in overtime on a 56-yard touchdown strike from Fitzpatrick to receiver [[Kevin Curtis]]. However, they lost their next four games. Martin and the Rams managed to end their disastrous season on a positive note, beating Dallas on the road in [[ESPN]]\u2019s [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|final Sunday night game]]. Martz was fired at season\u2019s end.\n\nDespite having a talent-laden roster, the Rams\u2019 front-office dysfunction had traveled from [[California]] to [[Missouri]]. With team president John Shaw remaining in Los Angeles after the relocation, president of football operations Jay Zygmunt clashed with head coach Martz, including an incident in which Zygmunt prevented the ill Martz from phoning in a play to his offensive coordinator. Poor draft choices and mediocre records began to pile up for the once-budding dynasty as the post-Martz era found the Rams in chaos. Hoping to regain control within the franchise, the Rams hired former Dolphins offensive coordinator [[Scott Linehan]] as head coach on January 19, 2006.<ref>Pasquarelli, Len (Jan. 19, 2006).

Despite a 7\u20138 record, the Rams had a chance to win the NFC West when they traveled to 6\u20139 Seattle for a [[Prime time|prime-time]] matchup. However, the Seahawks won the game and the division, 16\u20136. Bradford went on to win the 2010 Offensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe 2011 season started disastrously, with the Rams opening 0\u20136, finally winning an improbable victory over the Saints in Week 8. The team finished 2\u201314, with their only other win being a Week 10 victory over Cleveland. Bradford missed half the season with an ankle injury, and the Rams\u2019 offense was rated the worst in the league.\n\nAt the conclusion of a poor 2011, [[Steve Spagnulo|Spagnulo]] and nearly all of the coaching staff were fired except offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]], who was asked by the [[New England Patriots]] to return during the playoffs (he had been an assistant coach there prior to his disastrous stint as [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|Denver Broncos head coach]] in 2009). The Rams then hired head coach [[Jeff Fisher]], who had led the Tennessee Titans in their [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] loss to the Rams 12 years earlier. Fisher would then influence the hiring of new GM Les Snead and an all-new coaching staff including offensive coordinator [[Brian Schottenheimer]] and defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]]. Williams was eventually suspended for the entire 2012 season for his part in the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|Saints bounty scandal]].\n\nDespite the 2011 fiasco, the Rams continued with their plans to rebuild the team around Bradford and convinced the Redskins to give up two first-round draft picks and one second-round draft pick in exchange for the Rams\u2019 #2 overall pick. This moved the Rams down to the #6 pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], which they in turn traded to Dallas, but were left with an abundance of others for future use. Following the draft, they signed undrafted Oregon State punter [[Johnny Hekker]], who would become a [[Pro Bowl]]-caliber player.\n\nThe Rams started 2012 with low hopes, but the draft trade with Washington confirmed Bradford would be their quarterback of the future. The team then surprised some by starting off 3\u20132, their first winning record since 2006. They then lost three straight, but rebounded with a solid 4\u20134\u20131 finish, including a 24\u201324 road tie with eventual NFC champion San Francisco, to finish 7\u20138\u20131, a five-game improvement over 2011 and an impressive 4\u20131\u20131 record in the very competitive NFC West.\n\nIn 2013, the Rams finished with a 7\u20139 record. In the 2014 season, their 20th in St. Louis, the team would again miss the playoffs with a 6\u201310 record. Bradford missed the entire 2014 season with an injury, allowing [[Shaun Hill]] and [[Austin Davis]] opportunities at quarterback.\n\n==2015: Nick Foles and the final season in St. Louis==\nOn March 10, 2015, the Rams were involved in a rare trade of starting quarterbacks as they traded Bradford along with a fifth-round pick in 2015 to [[2015 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for the Eagles' [[Nick Foles]] along with a fourth-round pick in 2015 and a second round pick in 2016. Foles had a 14\u20134 record as starter and an impressive TD\u2013INT ratio of 46\u201317, while Bradford had an 18\u201330\u20131 record. On the day of the 2015 draft the Rams traded [[Zac Stacy]], the Rams\u2019 2013 rushing leader, for a 7th round pick to the Jets.\n\nThe Rams opened their 2015 season at home against Seattle. In Foles\u2019 Rams debut, he threw for 297 yards and a touchdown. Following the dramatic win, Foles struggled against his former divisional rival, the Redskins as the Rams lost 24\u201310. Foles' accuracy improved the following week but he threw no touchdowns and his first interception as a Ram against the Steelers, dropping the team to 1\u20132. Following the two losses Foles bounced back, handing the unbeaten Cardinals their first loss of the season. After that game, Foles\u2019 problems with turnovers from 2014 started to show, as he completed 11 passes out of 30 for 141 yards, 1 touchdown, and a career-high 4 interceptions against the Green Bay Packers. On November 16, Foles was benched in favor of [[Case Keenum]], who would start the remainder of the season.\n\n===Todd Gurley\u2019s arrival and the beginning of Jared Goff===\nLeading the team through their turbulence was rookie RB [[Todd Gurley]]. Gurley was drafted 10th overall in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2015/04/30/st-louis-rams-select-Todd-Gurley-2015-nfl-draft |title=St. Louis Rams select Todd Gurley No. 10 in 2015 NFL draft |first=Chris|last=Burke|work=Sports Illustrated|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref> Gurley, who tore his ACL in November 2014,  saw his rehabilitation go ahead of schedule and during the team's preseason, while he did not play, he practiced without pads on. Soon after, Gurley was medically cleared for full contact by St. Louis team physicians. On Sept 27, 2015, he made his NFL debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was eased into action and finished the game with 6 rushes for 9 yards. The following week, the Rams visited undefeated Arizona for an NFC west divisional matchup. Again Gurley started slow with just 2 yards at halftime, but rushed for 144 yards in the second half as the Rams edged the Cardinals 24\u201322. The next three games against the Packers, Browns, and 49ers would see Gurley rush for at least 128 rushing yards per game. He scored his first NFL touchdown on Oct 25th, 2015 against the Cleveland Browns. With 566 yards in his first four NFL starts, Gurley became the most prolific rusher in his first four NFL games since the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14028672/todd-gurley-st-louis-rams-sets-yardage-mark-first-four-starts-career|title=Todd Gurley sets mark for most yards in first four starts |first=Nick|last=Wagoner|publisher=\"ESPN\"|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref> In Week 15, Gurley became the third rookie in Rams history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season after [[Jerome Bettis]] and [[Eric Dickerson]] in the Rams 31\u201323 victory over the Buccaneers. and in their 23\u201317 victory over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and becoming the second Rams rookie to rush for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns since Eric Dickerson in 1983.\n\nThe Rams played their final home game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], on December 17, 2015. While the Edward Jones Dome was not at sell out capacity, a sizeable group of Rams fans attended the game, holding signs that read \u201cKeep the Rams in St. Louis.\u201d Enthusiastic chants of \u201cKeep the Rams\u201d and \u201cKroenke Sucks\u201d were heard during and after the game. Despite offensive production from Tampa Bay, the Rams still managed a 31\u201323 victory with [[Case Keenum]] throwing for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns, Todd Gurley rushing 48 yards, [[Tavon Austin]] rushing 32 yards and a touchdown, [[Kenny Britt]] receiving for 71 yards and 1 touchdown, and [[Jared Cook]] receiving for 64 yards. The Rams offense dominated this game as well the defense also put pressure on the Buccaneers quarterback [[Jameis Winston]].\n\nOn December 22, 2015, [[Todd Gurley]] along with fellow Rams players [[Aaron Donald]] and [[Johnny Hekker]]  were selected to be part of the [[2016 Pro Bowl]]. Gurley was one of three rookies to be selected to the Pro Bowl, along with [[2015 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] [[cornerback]] [[Marcus Peters]] and [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] [[wide receiver]] and [[Kickoff returner|kick returner]] [[Tyler Lockett]].\nThe Rams concluded their season with two road games in the West, winning 23\u201317 against the Seahawks and losing 19\u201316 in overtime against the 49ers. Overall, the team finished their final season in St. Louis with a 7\u20139 record.\n\n==Stadium problems; return relocation to Los Angeles==\n{{main|Edward Jones Dome#Future}}\n{{NFL Rams history}}\n\n===Stadium issues in St. Louis===\nThe Rams and the St. Louis CVC began negotiating a deal to get the Rams\u2019 home stadium, the [[Edward Jones Dome]], into the top 25 percent of stadiums in the league (i.e., top eight of 32 NFL teams, in reference to luxury boxes, amenities and overall fan experience).  Under the terms of the lease agreement, the St. Louis CVC was required to make modifications to the Edward Jones Dome in 2005.  However, then-owner Georgia Frontiere waived this provision, in exchange for cash that served as a penalty for the city's noncompliance.  The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, did make changes to the scoreboard and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remained dark.  The minor renovations which totaled about $70 million did not bring the stadium within the specifications required under the lease agreement, thus keeping the Dome in a state of uncertainty.\nOn February 1, 2013, a three-panel arbitrator selected to preside over the arbitration process found that the Edward Jones Dome was not in the top 25 percent of all NFL venues, as required under the terms of the lease agreement between the Rams and the CVC.  The arbitrator further found that the estimated $700 million in proposed renovations by the Rams was not unreasonable, given the terms of the lease agreement.  Finally, the [[City of St. Louis]] was ordered to pay the Rams\u2019 attorney fees which totaled a reported $2 million. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nPublicly, no interest was expressed by city, county and state officials in providing further funding to the Edward Jones Dome, in light of those entities (and taxpayers) continuing to owe approximately $300 million on the facility.  A resolution was not reached by the end of the [[2014 NFL season]]; therefore, with the City of St. Louis remaining in non-compliance with its obligations under the lease agreement, the Rams were free to nullify the lease and change to a year-to-year lease. Months later, the Rams scheduled a game to be played in [[London]], violating the Edward Jones Dome's terms of lease. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====National Car Rental Field proposal====\n{{main|National Car Rental Field}}\nIn an effort to try to keep the team in St. Louis, a multipurpose stadium, [[National Car Rental Field]], was proposed in 2015, estimated to cost $1.1 billion. The initial proposal called for the stadium to be paid for by a combination of $250 million from Rams, a $200 million loan from the NFL, $130 million from personal seat license sales, $55 million in tax credits and other public incentives, $350 million from extending the state bonds originally issued for the construction of the Edward Jones Dome.<ref name=financing>{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Tim|title=Edward Jones Dome authority to seek state tax credits|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/edward-jones-dome-authority-to-seek-state-tax-credits/article_262eb5e4-0704-58ff-bad3-5c6f2dd6fd59.html|website=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn January 9, 2016, the NFL distributed a report to team owners calling the St. Louis stadium plan \"unsatisfactory and inadequate\" to keep the Rams in St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|last2=Fenno|first2=Nathan|title=Roger Goodell says NFL stadium proposals are not viable in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-nfl-la-stadium-20160110-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n====City of Champions Revitilization Initiative; Los Angeles Entertainment Center====\n{{main|SoFi Stadium}}\nOn January 31, 2014, both the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' reported that Rams owner Stan Kroenke purchased approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the [[The Forum (Inglewood)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]] for a purchase price rumored to be between $90 million and $100 million.  Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Mr. Kroenke informed the league of the purchase.  As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. Kroenke subsequently announced plans to build an NFL stadium on the site, in connection with the owners of the adjacent 238-acre Hollywood Park site, Stockbridge Capital Group.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times\"/> This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California.  The land had been originally intended for a Walmart Supercenter, but [[Walmart]] could not get the necessary permits to build it.  Kroenke is married to [[Ann Walton Kroenke]], who is a member of the [[Walton family]], and many of Kroenke's real estate deals have involved Walmart properties.\n\nOn January 5, 2015, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Stan Kroenke and [[Stockbridge Capital Group]] were partnering up to develop a new NFL stadium on the [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] property owned by Kroenke. The project includes a stadium of 80,000 seats, and a performance venue of 6,000 seats, while reconfiguring the previously approved [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] plan for up to 890,000 square feet of retail, 780,000 square feet of office space, 2,500 new residential units, a 300-room hotel and 25 acres of public parks, playgrounds, open space and pedestrian and bicycle access.

They were among three teams (the others being the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[L.A. Chargers|San Diego Chargers]]) that had filed for relocation to Los Angeles. All three franchises had previously played in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. Weeks later, the NFL owners gathered in Houston for a meeting on January 12 to decide which teams, if any, would win relocation rights to Los Angeles. A few days before the scheduled owners meeting, [[Dallas Cowboys]] owner [[Jerry Jones]] suggested that the Rams and Chargers share Stan Kroenke's [[SoFi Stadium|Los Angeles Entertainment Center]]. This suggestion was taken as a possible option discussed in the Houston meetings. During the Los Angeles meeting, the Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, which consists of six NFL owners, favored the Carson project over the Rams\u2019 Inglewood project. However, in the first round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got the greater number of votes (21) while the Carson project received far fewer (11). This, however, did not meet the required threshold of 24 votes. In the second round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got 20 votes while the Carson proposal got 12. After hours of trying to reach a compromise, the Rams succeeded and announced their relocation to Los Angeles, effectively ending the team's 21-year tenure in St. Louis. The Chargers organization was given the first option to join the Rams after a year (if they failed to reach a new stadium deal with the city of San Diego); the Chargers exercised this option on January 12, 2017, making Los Angeles home to two NFL franchises again. (Had the Chargers declined to exercise this option, then the Raiders would have had this option).<ref>{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Rams to relocate to L.A.; Chargers first option to join|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000621645/article/rams-to-relocate-to-la-chargers-first-option-to-join|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rams to Return to Los Angeles|url=http://www.therams.com/news-and-events/article-1/Rams-to-Return-to-Los-Angeles/802b4e16-671e-4864-97b6-943115cdc4cf|publisher=St. Louis Rams|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120221040/http://www.therams.com/news-and-events/article-1/Rams-to-Return-to-Los-Angeles/802b4e16-671e-4864-97b6-943115cdc4cf|archive-date=January 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Season Results==\n===Key===\n*''The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal revenue, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but in at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Survey data from March in the USA indicated that, when museums were permitted to reopen, the public \"intent to visit\" metric for cultural activities should be unchanged overall from prior to the pandemic \u2013 but with a shifted preference for the ''kind'' of activity. Data indicated there would be a decreased willingness for attendance of activities in confined spaces, large immobile groups (such as cinemas), or tactile activities; with an increase in interest for activities outdoors or with large spaces (such as zoos and botanic gardens).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.colleendilen.com/2020/03/25/how-is-covid-19-impacting-likelihood-to-attend-different-cultural-entities-data/|title=Post-Pandemic, Which Cultural Entity Types Are People More Likely to Revisit?

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal revenue, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but in at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union.\" So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}\nStockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}</ref> In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.\n\nSome would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as \"orgasmic brinkmanship\", \"surfing\", or \"edging,\" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of \"karezza\".<ref>Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}</ref> In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.<ref>Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California</ref>\n\nOne purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... \"Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided\".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations, or, preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}\n\nKalman Andras Oszlar writes, \"Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship.\" Affected by this, we may get into the state of flow, and in the course of this, the couple charges up with energy, while \u2013 with focused attention ([[Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101]]) \u2013 the couple is submerging in that in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first, the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi]], and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor, the flow experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.\n\n===General===\nThere is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control.<ref name=\"Urban 1949\">{{cite web | last=Urban | first=Rudolf von | title=Sex perfection and marital happiness | publisher=Dial Press | year=1949 | oclc=688412035 | url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/14678823.html | access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\nLike [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the [[semen]].

The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative, and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Noyes 1872\">{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |url-status=live |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}</ref>\n\nEnglish novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is \"the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''.\"<ref>Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper & Row, 1962''</ref> Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W.

Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union.\" So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}\nStockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}</ref> In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.\n\nSome would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as \"orgasmic brinkmanship\", \"surfing\", or \"edging,\" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of \"karezza\".<ref>Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}</ref> In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.<ref>Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California</ref>\n\nOne purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... \"Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided\".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations, or, preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}\n\nKalman Andras Oszlar writes, \"Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship.\" Affected by this, we may get into the state of flow, and in the course of this, the couple charges up with energy, while \u2013 with focused attention ([[Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101]]) \u2013 the couple is submerging in that in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first, the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi]], and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor, the flow experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.\n\n===General===\nThere is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control.<ref name=\"Urban 1949\">{{cite web | last=Urban | first=Rudolf von | title=Sex perfection and marital happiness | publisher=Dial Press | year=1949 | oclc=688412035 | url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/14678823.html | access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\nLike [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the [[semen]].

The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative, and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Noyes 1872\">{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |url-status=live |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}</ref>\n\nEnglish novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is \"the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''.\"<ref>Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper & Row, 1962''</ref> Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W.
