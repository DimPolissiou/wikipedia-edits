It was last assigned to the [[10th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[RAF Alconbury]], England, where it was inactivated on 30 December 1992.\n\nThe squadron was first activated as the '''624th Bombardment Squadron''' in 1943, changing to the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' a few months later.  After training in the United States, it moved to England in March 1944, helping prepare for [[Operation Overlord]] by attacking targets in France.   Following [[D-Day]], the squadron moved to the continent, providing [[close air support]] for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.  The squadron earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] and was cited in the Order of the Day by the [[Belgian Army]].  After [[V-E Day]] The squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation.\n\nThe squadron was activated again in 1952, when it replaced an [[Air National Guard]] squadron that had been [[mobilization|mobilized]] for the [[Korean War]].  It trained for [[fighter bomber]] operations until inactivating in 1958.  A year later, it was activated in the Philippines as the '''509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' with an [[air defense]] mission.  It deployed [[interceptor aircraft]] to Taiwan and from 1962 to 1969 maintained detachments in Vietnam.\n\nThe squadron was inactivated in 1970, but returned in England in 1979. \n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was originally activated at [[Drew Field]], Florida on 1 March 1943 as the '''624th Bombardment Squadron''', one of the four original squadrons of the [[405th Bombardment Group]].  It was initially equipped with [[Douglas A-24 Banshee]]s and [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s.  Although retaining the same mission and equipment, in August the squadron was renamed the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron'''.  The following month, it moved to [[Walterboro Army Air Field]], South Carolina, where it began to fly the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s, with which it would be equipped for the rest of [[World War II]].  On 14 February 1944, the 509th left its training base for the [[European Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Maurer404FG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp.290\u2013291</ref>\n\n[[File:P-47D 509FS 405FG 1944-45.jpg|thumb|left|509th Fighter Squadron P-47D]] \nThe squadron arrived at its first station in the theater, [[RAF Christchurch]], England in early March 1944 and flew its first combat mission the following month.  It dropped the \"bomber\" portion of its designation in May, but retained the [[fighter bomber]] mission.  The 509th helped prepare for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, by striking [[military airfield]]s, and [[lines of communication]], particularly bridges and railroad marshalling yards.  On [[D-Day]], it flew combat patrols in the vicinity of [[Brest, France]], and in the following days flew [[armed reconnaissance]] missions over Normandy.<ref name=Maurer404FG/>\n\nToward the end of June, the squadron moved to [[Picauville Airfield]], France, and for the rest of the war concentrated on providing [[close air support]] for ground forces.  It supported [[Operation Cobra]], the breakout at [[Saint Lo]] in July with attacks on [[military vehicle]]s and [[artillery battery|artillery positions]].  The squadron engaged and destroyed a German armored column near [[Avranches]], France on 29 July 1944.  After immobilizing leading and trailing elements of the 3-mile (4.8&nbsp;km) long column, the rest of the tanks and trucks were systematically destroyed with multiple sorties.<ref>Rust, p. 97</ref> Its operations from D-Day through September 1944 supporting the liberation of Belgium earned the squadron a citation in the Order of the Day of the [[Belgian Army]].  The squadron received a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for action on 24 September 1944 when the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] experienced a [[counterattack]] by enemy forces and urgently needed air support.  Elements of the 405th Group attacked the enemy [[armoured fighting vehicle|armor]] despite an 800-foot ceiling that forced attacks to be made from low level in the face of intense [[flak]].  A second [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] element was unable to locate the tank battle because of the adverse weather, but located a reinforcing column of armor and trucks, causing major damage.  A third element attacked warehouses and other buildings in the vicinity that were being used by the enemy.<ref name=Maurer404FG/><ref group=note>Both Maurer and Rust identify the 405th Group's three attacks as being made by one of the group's three squadrons.  However, neither identifies which squadron was involved in which action.  All three of the group's squadrons were awarded a DUC for the day's attacks.  Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp.290\u2013291; Rust, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission of the war on 8 May 1945. It briefly served in the [[military occupation|occupation]] forces at [[AAF Station Straubing]], but by 8 July was mostly a paper unit.  Its remaining personnel returned to the United States in October and the squadron was inactivated upon arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Maurer404FG/>\n\n===Reactivation as a fighter bomber unit===\n[[File:509th Tactical Fighter Squadron - North American F-100D-40-NH Super Sabre - 55-2768.jpg|thumb|509th FBS F-100D 55-2768]]\nThe squadron returned to its designation as the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and was activated at [[Godman Air Force Base]], Kentucky on 1 December 1952, when it assumed the mission, personnel and F-47 Thunderbolt aircraft of the [[141st Fighter-Bomber Squadron]], a [[New Jersey Air National Guard]] unit that had been [[mobilization|called to active duty]] for the [[Korean War]].  However, Godman was not suitable for jet fighter operations, and in April 1953, the squadron moved to [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia<ref name=Maurer509FS/> as the Air Force prepared to transfer Godman to the Army.  After arriving at Langley, the squadron was able to upgrade to [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]s, later upgrading to [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]s.  The squadron was inactivated with the rest of the 405th Wing in July 1958.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Ravenstein405FW>Ravenstein, pp. 217\u2013219</ref>\n\n===Air defense in the Pacific===\n[[File:509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Convair TF-102A-30-CO Delta Dagger 55-4042.jpg|thumb| Squadron TF-102 at Clark Air Base, Philippines in 1962<ref group=note>Aircraft is Convair TF-102A-30-CO Delta Dagger, serial 55-4042.</ref>]]\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' and activated in April 1959, when the [[405th Fighter Wing]] replaced the [[6200th Air Base Wing]] at [[Clark Air Base]], Philippines.  The squadron assumed the mission, personnel and [[North American F-86D Sabre]]s of the [[26th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which was simultaneously inactivated.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 134\u2013135</ref> The following year, the squadron replaced its Sabres with [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]]s, which were armed with [[AIM-4 Falcon]]s and equipped with [[data link]] for intercept control.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Ravenstein405FW/>\n\nThe squadron mission was [[air defense]] of the Philippines, but as the only USAF interceptor unit in the southern Pacific, the squadron was called on to deploy elements to other countries.<ref name=Ravenstein405FW/> One of the earliest deployments was to [[Don Muang Airport]] outside [[Bangkok]], Thailand of six F-102s under [[Operation Bell Tone]].<ref>Futrell & Blumenson, p. 279</ref> It also deployed to Taiwan.  In March 1962, the American radar unit at [[Pleiku Air Base]] began to detect unknown aircraft entering South Vietnamese airspace.  In response, the squadron sent a detachment of four \"Deuces\" to [[Tan Son Nhut Airport]], near [[Saigon]].  One was a two-seat TF-102, which proved better at intercepting the slow-moving aircraft used for training to simulate the intruders.  As a result, more TF-102s were drawn from [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s for the detachment.  In July, the squadron's planes were replaced by [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-5Q Q-Birds]], and the Air Force and Navy began a series of six-week rotations for air defense in Vietnam.<ref>Futrell & Blumenson, pp. 130\u2013131</ref>\n\n[[File:F-102As 509FIS over Vietnam Nov1966.jpg|thumb|Squadron F-102As over Vietnam in November 1966.]]\nThe [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]] resulted in another deployment of squadron [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] to Vietnam.  On 5 August 1964, six F-102s deployed from Clark to [[Da Nang Air Base]] in the northern part of South Vietnam.<ref>Futrell & Blumenson, p. 229</ref> By the end of 1966, the squadron was maintaining six planes on alert at [[Bien Hoa Air Base]] in addition to the six at Da Nang, with another ten located in Thailand at Don Muang and at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]].  After June 1966, the detachments in Thailand were maintained jointly with the [[64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which had been activated as a second F-102 unit at Clark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433134/64-aggressor-squadron-acc/ |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 64 Aggressor Squadron (ACC)|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=CoronaHarvest>Corona Harvest Withdrawal, pp. 20\u201321</ref> Fourteen aircraft were kept on five-minute [[alert status|alert]], while the rest were expected to respond within an hour.

It was last assigned to the [[10th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[RAF Alconbury]], England, where it was inactivated on 30 December 1992.\n\nThe squadron was first activated as the '''624th Bombardment Squadron''' in 1943, changing to the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' a few months later.  After training in the United States, it moved to England in March 1944, helping prepare for [[Operation Overlord]] by attacking targets in France.   Following [[D-Day]], the squadron moved to the continent, providing [[close air support]] for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.  The squadron earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] and was cited in the Order of the Day by the [[Belgian Army]].  After [[V-E Day]] The squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation.\n\nThe squadron was activated again in 1952, when it replaced an [[Air National Guard]] squadron that had been [[mobilization|mobilized]] for the [[Korean War]].  It trained for [[fighter bomber]] operations until inactivating in 1958.  A year later, it was activated in the Philippines as the '''509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' with an [[air defense]] mission.  It deployed [[interceptor aircraft]] to Taiwan and from 1962 to 1969 maintained detachments in Vietnam.\n\nThe squadron was inactivated in 1970, but returned to the [[fighter bomber]] mission in England in 1979. \n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was originally activated at [[Drew Field]], Florida on 1 March 1943 as the '''624th Bombardment Squadron''', one of the four original squadrons of the [[405th Bombardment Group]].  It was initially equipped with [[Douglas A-24 Banshee]]s and [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s.  Although retaining the same mission and equipment, in August the squadron was renamed the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron'''.  The following month, it moved to [[Walterboro Army Air Field]], South Carolina, where it began to fly the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s, with which it would be equipped for the rest of [[World War II]].  On 14 February 1944, the 509th left its training base for the [[European Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Maurer404FG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp.290\u2013291</ref>\n\n[[File:P-47D 509FS 405FG 1944-45.jpg|thumb|left|509th Fighter Squadron P-47D]] \nThe squadron arrived at its first station in the theater, [[RAF Christchurch]], England in early March 1944 and flew its first combat mission the following month.  It dropped the \"bomber\" portion of its designation in May, but retained the [[fighter bomber]] mission.  The 509th helped prepare for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, by striking [[military airfield]]s, and [[lines of communication]], particularly bridges and railroad marshalling yards.  On [[D-Day]], it flew combat patrols in the vicinity of [[Brest, France]], and in the following days flew [[armed reconnaissance]] missions over Normandy.<ref name=Maurer404FG/>\n\nToward the end of June, the squadron moved to [[Picauville Airfield]], France, and for the rest of the war concentrated on providing [[close air support]] for ground forces.  It supported [[Operation Cobra]], the breakout at [[Saint Lo]] in July with attacks on [[military vehicle]]s and [[artillery battery|artillery positions]].  The squadron engaged and destroyed a German armored column near [[Avranches]], France on 29 July 1944.  After immobilizing leading and trailing elements of the 3-mile (4.8&nbsp;km) long column, the rest of the tanks and trucks were systematically destroyed with multiple sorties.<ref>Rust, p. 97</ref> Its operations from D-Day through September 1944 supporting the liberation of Belgium earned the squadron a citation in the Order of the Day of the [[Belgian Army]].  The squadron received a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for action on 24 September 1944 when the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] experienced a [[counterattack]] by enemy forces and urgently needed air support.  Elements of the 405th Group attacked the enemy [[armoured fighting vehicle|armor]] despite an 800-foot ceiling that forced attacks to be made from low level in the face of intense [[flak]].  A second [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] element was unable to locate the tank battle because of the adverse weather, but located a reinforcing column of armor and trucks, causing major damage.  A third element attacked warehouses and other buildings in the vicinity that were being used by the enemy.<ref name=Maurer404FG/><ref group=note>Both Maurer and Rust identify the 405th Group's three attacks as being made by one of the group's three squadrons.  However, neither identifies which squadron was involved in which action.  All three of the group's squadrons were awarded a DUC for the day's attacks.  Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp.290\u2013291; Rust, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission of the war on 8 May 1945. It briefly served in the [[military occupation|occupation]] forces at [[AAF Station Straubing]], but by 8 July was mostly a paper unit.  Its remaining personnel returned to the United States in October and the squadron was inactivated upon arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Maurer404FG/>\n\n===Reactivation as a fighter bomber unit===\n[[File:509th Tactical Fighter Squadron - North American F-100D-40-NH Super Sabre - 55-2768.jpg|thumb|509th FBS F-100D 55-2768]]\nThe squadron returned to its designation as the '''509th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and was activated at [[Godman Air Force Base]], Kentucky on 1 December 1952, when it assumed the mission, personnel and F-47 Thunderbolt aircraft of the [[141st Fighter-Bomber Squadron]], a [[New Jersey Air National Guard]] unit that had been [[mobilization|called to active duty]] for the [[Korean War]].  However, Godman was not suitable for jet fighter operations, and in April 1953, the squadron moved to [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia<ref name=Maurer509FS/> as the Air Force prepared to transfer Godman to the Army.  After arriving at Langley, the squadron was able to upgrade to [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]s, later upgrading to [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]s.  The squadron was inactivated with the rest of the 405th Wing in July 1958.<ref name=Maurer509FS/><ref name=Ravenstein405FW>Ravenstein, pp. 217\u2013219</ref>\n\n===Air defense in the Pacific===\n[[File:509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Convair TF-102A-30-CO Delta Dagger 55-4042.jpg|thumb| Squadron TF-102 at Clark Air Base, Philippines in 1962<ref group=note>Aircraft is Convair TF-102A-30-CO Delta Dagger, serial 55-4042.</ref>]]\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' and activated in April 1959, when the [[405th Fighter Wing]] replaced the [[6200th Air Base Wing]] at [[Clark Air Base]], Philippines.

In March 1962, the American radar unit at [[Pleiku Air Base]] began to detect unknown aircraft entering South Vietnamese airspace.  In response, the squadron sent a detachment of four \"Deuces\" to [[Tan Son Nhut Airport]], near [[Saigon]].  One was a two-seat TF-102, which proved better at intercepting the slow-moving aircraft used for training to simulate the intruders.  As a result, more TF-102s were drawn from [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s for the detachment.  In July, the squadron's planes were replaced by [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-5Q Q-Birds]], and the Air Force and Navy began a series of six-week rotations for air defense in Vietnam.<ref>Futrell & Blumenson, pp. 130\u2013131</ref>\n\n[[File:F-102As 509FIS over Vietnam Nov1966.jpg|thumb|Squadron F-102As over Vietnam in November 1966.]]\nThe [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]] resulted in another deployment of squadron [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] to Vietnam.  On 5 August 1964, six F-102s deployed from Clark to [[Da Nang Air Base]] in the northern part of South Vietnam.<ref>Futrell & Blumenson, p. 229</ref> By the end of 1966, the squadron was maintaining six planes on alert at [[Bien Hoa Air Base]] in addition to the six at Da Nang, with another ten located in Thailand at Don Muang and at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]].  After June 1966, the detachments in Thailand were maintained jointly with the [[64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which had been activated as a second F-102 unit at Clark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433134/64-aggressor-squadron-acc/ |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 64 Aggressor Squadron (ACC)|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=CoronaHarvest>Corona Harvest Withdrawal, pp. 20\u201321</ref> Fourteen aircraft were kept on five-minute [[alert status|alert]], while the rest were expected to respond within an hour.

The founding legend refers to the itinerant bishop [[Saint Pirmin]], with the first documentary mention of the abbey in 762.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|11595|Pf\u00e4fers (Kloster)}}</ref> The monastery controlled the important route through the [[Kunkels Pass]] to the passes into [[Italy]] in the [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. After the bishop's seat of [[Chur]] the monastery was the most important religious centre in Chur-Raetia and the [[diocese of Chur]]. Many parishes in the region were founded from Pf\u00e4fers in the 9th and 10th centuries. The substantial influence of the monastery was concentrated in eastern Switzerland, especially between [[Weesen]] and [[Maienfeld]], but reached as far as present-day [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the [[Val Bregaglia]], the [[Vinschgau]] and the [[County of Tyrol]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn 840, Emperor [[Lothair I]], king of Northern Italy and, nominally, [[Frankish Empire|Emperor of the Franks]], assured the monastery the right of freely electing its abbot. This was extended in 861 to include [[ecclesiastical immunity]] and royal protection. The [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Louis the Child]] gave Pf\u00e4fers, in 905, to [[Solomon III, Bishop of Constance]], who was also the abbot of [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St Gall]].<ref name=HDS/> Between 914 and 949, the Abbey of St. Gall and the bishop of Chur fought over the protectorship of the Abbey. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]], finally confirmed again in 949 the right of free election of the abbot to the monks themselves. During the [[Investiture Controversy]], Pf\u00e4fers again fell under foreign control, however. In 1095, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] gave the abbey to the [[diocese of Basel]], which exchanged the abbey with [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] in 1114 for the castle of [[Rappoltstein]] in [[Alsace]]; only the intervention of [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1116 restored the monastery's freedom.<ref name=HDS/> During the early Middle Ages Pf\u00e4fers remained the most important monastery in the diocese of Chur, and intellectual centre of the region. The three most important Chur-Raetian manuscripts were made in Pf\u00e4fers: ''Liber Aureus'' (the main source for the abbey's history), ''Liber viventium'' (the abbey's memorial book) and ''Vidimus Heider'' (the abbey's [[cartulary]]).\n\nIn 1208, [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], passed ''[[Vogt]]ei'' (protectorship) of the monastery to the [[Barony of Sax]], to whom the monks pledged at least partial allegiance. In 1257, Abbot Rudolf bought back their freedom for 300 silver [[mark (money)|mark]]s and, in 1261, transferred it to the {{ill|Freiherren von Wildenberg|lt=Lords of Wildenberg|de}} of [[Freudenberg Castle]]. In the 14th century there were two separate ''Vogtei'' over the monastery and the upper [[Tamina]]tal: Castle Freudenberg and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]]. Later, the protectorship passed to the counts of [[Werdenberg-Sargans]] and [[Werdenberg-Heiligenberg]]. In 1397, the monastery again bought back their ''Vogtei'' and, in 1408, [[Rupert of Germany|King Rupert]] granted the monastery the privilege to choose its own protector.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the [[county of Sargans]] as a ''[[Gemeine Herrschaft]]'' of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], the abbey became a [[Old Swiss Confederacy#Protectorates|Swiss protectorate]] in [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Sargans and the ''[[Acht Orte]]'' of the Confederacy minus Berne. The monastery was caught in the turmoil of the [[Swabian War]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the general financial and political difficulties that engulfed the region. Abbot John Heider (1586\u20131600) managed briefly to restore the original position of the monastery, but under his successors the situation worsened so the Swiss Confederacy took over administration of the monastery.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Pfaefers-Benediktinerabtei.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pf\u00e4fers Abbey and the [[Alps]].]]\n[[File:Klosterkirche pfaefers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church interior of Pf\u00e4fers Abbey.]]\nIn 1665 a fire destroyed the medieval monastery and church.<ref name=HDS/> In 1672, Abbot Justus Zink presented plans by John Serro and Giuglio Barbieri for rebuilding the abbey, in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], closer to the mountain slope, in the present dominant position, with the first rooms ready for occupation in 1674. Because of the disastrous financial situation, Abbot Zink was forced to resign in 1676, passing control to the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. His successor, Abbot Boniface I Tschupp, managed the financial recovery and completed the construction in 1694, with the new abbey church dedicated in the same year.\n\n===18th century===\nThe election of the abbot caused controversy in 1734 as [[Z\u00fcrich]]\u2014one of the Swiss cantons in condominium over the abbey\u2014refused to confirm the election of abbot Ambrosius M\u00fcller; Johann Jakob Scheuchzer was therefore commissioned to examine the royal privileges of the abbey. Some of the Imperial and Papal papers confirming rights of the monastery were identified as 17th-century forgeries. Negotiations at the 1738 [[Tagsatzung]] finally confirmed the rights of the abbey over the municipalities of [[Pf\u00e4fers]], [[V\u00e4ttis]], [[Valens]] and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]].\n\nIn 1794, a revolt of the monastery's subjects was crushed by the ''Vogt'' of Sargans. On 11 November 1798, during the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], the county of Sargans was released by the Confederation and Abbot Benedict Bochsler had to free his subjects in a similar manner. After the French invasion, the monastery was abolished and partially destroyed. In 1801, the abbot returned with some brothers and, in 1803, the monastery was formally restored, after the founding of the [[canton of St. Gallen]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===19th century===\nFinancial struggles prompted the last abbot of the monastery Plazidus Pfister to request the secularization of the abbey, a request to which [[Pope Gregory XVI]] acceded in a letter dated 20 March 1838. On 20 November 1838, the Great Council of the canton of St Gallen declared that the monastery be secularised and removed its assets. The Catholic Church tried to claim the assets in vain, conceding them to St Gallen in November 1839. On 14 November 1845, in the buildings of the abbey was founded the cantonal asylum of St. Pirminsberg, today's St Pirminsberg Psychiatric Hospital. The precious artefacts from the abbey were auctioned and scattered in museums around the world. Konrad von Ritter from [[Wolfurt]] took possession of the famous Wolfurter cup ({{lang-de|Wolfurter Kelch}}), created in the monastery in the 13th century. In 1853, the archives of the monastery were passed to Stiftsarchiv St Gallen, the archives of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]].\n\nFrom 1619 to 1845 the bones of the [[archpriest]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Rusca]] were kept in the Pf\u00e4fers monastery; he is currently nominated for [[beatification]]. Today these [[relic]]s are in the Collegiate Church of [[Sondrio]] in [[Valtellina]].\n\n== Sources ==\n''This article is based on a translation of the article [[:de:Kloster Pf\u00e4fers|Kloster Pf\u00e4fers]] from the [[German Wikipedia]].

Abbot John Heider (1586\u20131600) managed briefly to restore the original position of the monastery, but under his successors the situation worsened so the Swiss Confederacy took over administration of the monastery.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Pfaefers-Benediktinerabtei.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pf\u00e4fers Abbey and the [[Alps]].]]\n[[File:Klosterkirche pfaefers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church interior of Pf\u00e4fers Abbey.]]\nIn 1665 a fire destroyed the medieval monastery and church.<ref name=HDS/> In 1672, Abbot Justus Zink presented plans by John Serro and Giuglio Barbieri for rebuilding the abbey, in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], closer to the mountain slope, in the present dominant position, with the first rooms ready for occupation in 1674. Because of the disastrous financial situation, Abbot Zink was forced to resign in 1676, passing control to the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. His successor, Abbot Boniface I Tschupp, managed the financial recovery and completed the construction in 1694, with the new abbey church dedicated in the same year.\n\n===18th century===\nThe election of the abbot caused controversy in 1734 as [[Z\u00fcrich]] \u2014 one of the Swiss cantons in condominium over the abbey \u2014 refused to confirm the election of abbot Ambrosius M\u00fcller; Johann Jakob Scheuchzer was therefore commissioned to examine the royal privileges of the abbey. Some of the Imperial and Papal papers confirming rights of the monastery were identified as 17th-century forgeries. Negotiations at the 1738 [[Tagsatzung]] finally confirmed the rights of the abbey over the municipalities of [[Pf\u00e4fers]], [[V\u00e4ttis]], [[Valens]] and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]].\n\nIn 1794, a revolt of the monastery's subjects was crushed by the ''Vogt'' of Sargans. On 11 November 1798, during the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], the county of Sargans was released by the Confederation and Abbot Benedict Bochsler had to free his subjects in a similar manner. After the French invasion, the monastery was abolished and partially destroyed. In 1801, the abbot returned with some brothers and, in 1803, the monastery was formally restored, after the founding of the [[canton of St. Gallen]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===19th century===\nFinancial struggles prompted the last abbot of the monastery Plazidus Pfister, 1838 in Rome to request the secularization of the abbey, a request to which [[Pope Gregory XVI]] acceded in a letter dated 20 March 1838. On 20 November 1838, the Great Council of the canton of St Gallen declared that the monastery be secularised and removed its assets. The Catholic Church tried to claim the assets in vain, conceding them to St Gallen in November 1839. On 14 November 1845, in the buildings of the abbey was founded the cantonal asylum of St. Pirminsberg, today's St Pirminsberg Psychiatric Hospital. The precious artefacts from the abbey were auctioned and scattered in museums around the world. Konrad von Ritter from [[Wolfurt]] took  possession of the famous Wolfurter cup ({{lang-de|Wolfurter Kelch}}), created in the monastery in the 13th century. In 1853, the archives of the monastery were passed to Stiftsarchiv St Gallen, the archives of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]].\n\nFrom 1619 to 1845 the bones of the [[archpriest]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Rusca]] were kept in the monastery Pf\u00e4fers, who is currently nominated for [[beatification]]; today these [[relic]]s are in the Collegiate Church of [[Sondrio]] in [[Valtellina]].\n\n== Sources ==\n''This article is based on a translation of the article [[:de:Kloster Pf\u00e4fers|Kloster Pf\u00e4fers]] from the [[German Wikipedia]].

There are numerous research groups within each Global Challenge. They are:\n\n===Responding to Climate Change===\nThe Responding to Climate Change Global Challenge encapsulates a number of  research projects that address scientific, cultural, health and social issues relating to climate change. Broad themes of the research include: \n* Drivers and pressures of climate change\n* States of and impacts on systems affected by climate change\n* Managing a response to climate change.\n\n===Public Health and Non-Communicable Disease===\nThe Public Health and Non-Communicable Disease Global Challenge emphasizes a [[life course approach]] to opportunities for addressing non-communicable diseases, especially in low and middle income countries and transitioning populations, as well as developed societies where there are social disparities in risk. \nThere is a particular focus on:\n* Health of family and migrants across the lifecourse\n* Resilience of adolescents in different cultural contexts\n* Schools as a setting for reducing risk factors associated with NCDs.\n\n===Understanding Cultures===\nThe Understanding Cultures Global Challenge focuses on how globalization trends are challenging national, regional and individual cultural practices. These trends include A more integrated transnational economic system, the rise of global communications networks, increasing levels of population mobility, the advent of international consumer brands and widening social inequalities. \nThere is a particular focus on:\n* Global Migration and Population \n* Generations in Global Context\n* Chinese Culture in the World. \n\n===Global Higher Education and Research===\nThe Global Higher Education and Research Global Challenge addresses the sources, mechanisms and social structures that give rise to higher education challenges, and proposes reform policies for international research and education. There is a particular focus on issues of access and equity of higher education. \n\n'''QS & THE Rankings of Members (2019)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/|title=Top Universities|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/|title=Home|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Institution\n|Country\n|QS Ranking -  2019\n|THE Ranking -  2019\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|University of  Alberta\n|Canada\n|113\n|132\n|-\n|University of  Auckland\n|New Zealand\n|83\n|201-250\n|-\n|University of  Bergen\n|Norway\n|163\n|197\n|-\n|University of  Bristol\n|UK\n|49\n|78\n|-\n|University of  Cape Town\n|South Africa\n|198\n|156\n|-\n|University  College Dublin\n|Ireland\n|185\n|201-250\n|-\n|University of  Ghana\n|Ghana\n|801-1000\n|801-1000\n|-\n|Chinese  University of Hong Kong\n|China\n|46\n|53\n|-\n|University of  Leeds\n|UK\n|93\n|153\n|-\n|Maastricht  University\n|The Netherlands\n|239\n|128\n|-\n|University of  Massachusetts Amherst\n|USA\n|305\n|164\n|-\n|National Cheng  Kung University\n|Taiwan\n|225\n|501-600\n|-\n|Renmin  University of China\n|China\n| -\n|501-601\n|-\n|University of  Rochester\n|USA\n|170\n|163\n|-\n|University of  Sheffield\n|UK\n|78\n|106\n|-\n|University of  Southampton\n|UK\n|97\n|118\n|-\n|University of  Sydney\n|Australia\n|42\n|59\n|-\n|Tecnol\u00f3gico de  Monterrey\n|Mexico\n|158\n|601-800\n|-\n|Universidade  Federal de Minas Gerais\n|Brazil\n|651-700\n| -\n|-\n|University of  Western Australia\n|Australia\n|86\n|134\n|-\n|University of  York\n|UK\n|148\n|119\n|-\n|Zhejiang  University\n|China\n|54\n|101\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Worldwide Universities Network}}\n\n[[Category:International college and university associations and consortia]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2018}}\n{{Infobox\n| above = Worldwide Universities Network\n| image = [[File:WUN_Logo_2014.png|225px|Worldwide Universities Network logo]]\n| label1 = Established | data1 = 2000\n| label2 = Members     | data2 = 23\n| label3 = Continents  | data3 = [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Oceania]]\n| label4 = Countries   | data4 = [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ghana]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]], [[Taiwan]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]]\n| label5 = Chair       | data5 = Professor dr [[Martin Paul (professor)]], [[Maastricht University]]\n| label6 = Executive Director | data6 = Professor [[Peter Lennie]]\n| label7 = General Manager | data7 = Dr Mike Hasenmueller\n| label8 = Acronym     | data8 = WUN\n| label9 = Homepage    | data9 = http://www.wun.ac.uk\n}}\n\nThe '''Worldwide Universities Network''' ('''WUN''') is an alliance of 22 research-intensive universities.

It is made up senior administrators, usually at the level of Vice-President or Deputy Vice-Chancellor with responsibility for the research or internationalisation priorities of the member universities. \n\n\n'''Institutional Coordinators'''\n\nEach WUN member university appoints an administrator to manage the implementation of the WUN strategies and programs on campus and to serve as the main contact point for network initiatives. This group shares information on collaborative opportunities and develops WUN\u2019s research programs.\n\n==Global Challenges==\nWUN has identified four Global Challenges as the focus for its thematic research areas. There are numerous research groups within each Global Challenge. They are:\n\n===Responding to Climate Change===\nThe Responding to Climate Change Global Challenge encapsulates a number of  research projects that address scientific, cultural, health and social issues relating to climate change. Broad themes of the research include: \n* Drivers and pressures of climate change\n* States of and impacts on systems affected by climate change\n* Managing a response to climate change.\n\n===Public Health and Non-Communicable Disease===\nThe Public Health and Non-Communicable Disease Global Challenge emphasizes a [[life course approach]] to opportunities for addressing non-communicable diseases, especially in low and middle income countries and transitioning populations, as well as developed societies where there are social disparities in risk. \nThere is a particular focus on:\n* Health of family and migrants across the lifecourse\n* Resilience of adolescents in different cultural contexts\n* Schools as a setting for reducing risk factors associated with NCDs.\n\n===Understanding Cultures===\nThe Understanding Cultures Global Challenge focuses on how globalization trends are challenging national, regional and individual cultural practices. These trends include A more integrated transnational economic system, the rise of global communications networks, increasing levels of population mobility, the advent of international consumer brands and widening social inequalities. \nThere is a particular focus on:\n* Global Migration and Population \n* Generations in Global Context\n* Chinese Culture in the World. \n\n===Global Higher Education and Research===\nThe Global Higher Education and Research Global Challenge addresses the sources, mechanisms and social structures that give rise to higher education challenges, and proposes reform policies for international research and education. There is a particular focus on issues of access and equity of higher education. \n\n'''QS & THE Rankings of Members (2019)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/|title=Top Universities|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/|title=Home|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Institution\n|Country\n|QS Ranking -  2019\n|THE Ranking -  2019\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|University of  Alberta\n|Canada\n|113\n|132\n|-\n|University of  Auckland\n|New Zealand\n|83\n|201-250\n|-\n|University of  Bergen\n|Norway\n|163\n|197\n|-\n|University of  Bristol\n|UK\n|49\n|78\n|-\n|University of  Cape Town\n|South Africa\n|198\n|156\n|-\n|University  College Dublin\n|Ireland\n|185\n|201-250\n|-\n|University of  Ghana\n|Ghana\n|801-1000\n|801-1000\n|-\n|Chinese  University of Hong Kong\n|China\n|46\n|53\n|-\n|University of  Leeds\n|UK\n|93\n|153\n|-\n|Maastricht  University\n|The Netherlands\n|239\n|128\n|-\n|University of  Massachusetts Amherst\n|USA\n|305\n|164\n|-\n|National Cheng  Kung University\n|Taiwan\n|225\n|501-600\n|-\n|Renmin  University of China\n|China\n| -\n|501-601\n|-\n|University of  Rochester\n|USA\n|170\n|163\n|-\n|University of  Sheffield\n|UK\n|78\n|106\n|-\n|University of  Southampton\n|UK\n|97\n|118\n|-\n|University of  Sydney\n|Australia\n|42\n|59\n|-\n|Tecnol\u00f3gico de  Monterrey\n|Mexico\n|158\n|601-800\n|-\n|Universidade  Federal de Minas Gerais\n|Brazil\n|651-700\n| -\n|-\n|University of  Western Australia\n|Australia\n|86\n|134\n|-\n|University of  York\n|UK\n|148\n|119\n|-\n|Zhejiang  University\n|China\n|54\n|101\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Worldwide Universities Network}}\n\n[[Category:International college and university associations and consortia]]\n", "name_user": "Wungm", "label": "safe", "comment": "number of members adjusted - 22", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Universities_Network"}

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[transportation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.
