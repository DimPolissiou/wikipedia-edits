Courageously, Agassi made a few social [[political music|political songs]], forgetting the strong [[censorship in Iran]]. These songs, which were about humanity, equality, and freedom, were ultimately collected by the [[Iranian government]] and banned. \n\nDue to these distressing outcomes and also because of the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]], Agassi relocated to the United States in the late 1970s for the social and [[political freedom]] there. Meanwhile, the [[Iraqi government]] was also rather vehement towards his songs, as they emboldened the Assyrians of Iraq, who opted for peace, freedom and human rights. As such, a few of Agassi's songs were banned there and his name was registered on a [[blacklist]] by [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=halmon />\n\nTo this day, he gives concerts regularly in the United States, Europe and Australia. In 2010, he's travelled to [[Syria]], and in 2016 he has visited [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], to perform at the concerts and parties there.

Currently, in addition to the U.S., the drink is available in [[Albania]], [[China]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] (only in cans and 1-litre bottles),  [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] (only in cans), [[Romania]] and [[Peru]]. It is also available in [[Japan]], where it is still known as Cherry Coke. Until recently it was available in Ireland only through British pharmaceutical chains such as [[Boots UK|Boots]] and [[Superdrug]]; however, it returned officially to the country in 2014.\nIn [[New Zealand]], Coca-Cola Cherry can be found in some supermarkets (usually imported from the UK or US).\nIn the past, the product has been distributed in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Ukraine]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Israel]]. \nThe Australian version was released between 2003 and 2004 and was a different formula to the US version. It is no longer bottled in these countries, although the U.S. product is imported by some Canadian convenience stores near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], as well as by [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGA]], [[Costco]] and specialty retailers in Australia. It was reintroduced in all Canadian grocery stores in 2016. In Sweden it is available at different grocery stores. The grocery stores source import from the United States and the self-produced Coca-Cola Cherry from Coca-Cola enterprises Sweden. In Norway, Coca-Cola Cherry is available at select stores.\n\nSince January 2011, Coca-Cola Cherry is also available in [[Switzerland]], where it is distributed by [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]]. Since July 2013 Coca-Cola Cherry is available in [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Spain]]. It returned to [[Canada]] by the 2013, 2014, and 2015 holiday season in cases of 24 cans at Costco stores for the two former, and general retail in the latter. It featured the same flavour and formula as the United States flavour, with a slightly edited, bilingual version of that country's can design. In 2014, it was featured as one of the last major attempts by [[Target Canada]] in Ontario to gain market share before announcing its closing in January of the following year. It has been mentioned by Target Canada itself that Cherry Coke was the number one requested grocery request by shoppers.\n\nAs of July 2014 Coca-Cola Cherry is available in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (due to same label for the three countries). The label is same as regular Coke but with different cherry color and cherry word below Coca-Cola with an image of Cherry to the left of the word \"cherry\". Later in late 2014, it was introduced in [[Uruguay]] (only in cans).\n\nCoca-Cola Cherry returned to Canada once again in the summer of 2015 and 2016 as part of the \"Share a Coke\" campaign.  Cherry Coke, in flats of 24 cans, have recently been available at Safeway, Sobeys, and Loblaws-owned stores across Canada with markings indicating production at the Brampton, Ontario bottling facility.\n\nCoca-Cola Cherry returned to Brazil during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Originally available in certain markets in the country, availability of soft drink has expanded to other regions; while Cherry Coke has been relaunched, [[Vanilla Coke]] has also been launched.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coca-Cola lan\u00e7a sabores baunilha e cereja no Brasil em edi\u00e7\u00e3o limitada |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2016/06/1786656-coca-cola-lanca-sabores-baunilha-e-cereja-no-brasil-em-edicao-limitada.shtml |website=Folha de S.Paulo |language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging and marketing==\n\nPackaging for Coca-Cola Cherry differs greatly from country to country. Coca-Cola has altered the logos and label designs in the U.S. for Coca-Cola Cherry several times since it was introduced in 1985. In most areas, the current can and bottle label designs are based on the standard Coca-Cola label in a pink or purple hue, often with images of cherries.\n\nOn February 7, 2007, Coca-Cola launched a new campaign for the Coca-Cola Cherry brand in the U.S., resulting in a significant redesign of the product's label.  [[Jay-Z]] was chosen to be the spokesman and played a part in designing the new can graphics.  A new diet version, Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, was also introduced. The original Diet Coke Cherry had still remained available in 12-packs up until 2018 when it was replaced with Diet Coke Feisty Cherry. These designs remained in place until early 2011, when a cleaner design (closer to the label designs used overseas) was introduced.\n\nAs part of Coca-Cola's ongoing \"One Brand\" marketing campaign, a new U.S. packaging design for Coca-Cola Cherry was introduced in January 2019. The new packaging follows the design principles already employed in the United States for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Coca-Cola Zero Sugar]], and [[Coca-Cola Life]]. The word \"Coca-Cola\" is superimposed upon a red disc with a picture of a cherry below the text. The background color of the can or bottle remains the same shade of purple introduced in the 2007 design. The word \"Cherry\" is placed above the red disc, similar to the \"Original Taste\" text currently used on cans and bottles of original Coca-Cola.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Coca-Cola Cherry}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Varieties of Coca-Cola}}\n{{Coca-Cola brands}}\n{{Cherry colas}}\n\n[[Category:Coca-Cola brands]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Cherry colas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Cherry Coke|the historic house in the United States|Chericoke}}\n{{Infobox Beverage \n|name         = Coca-Cola Cherry \n|image        = [[File:Cherry Coke Bottle.jpeg|76px]]\n|type         = [[Cherry|Cherry-flavored]] [[cola]]\n|manufacturer = [[The Coca-Cola Company]]\n|origin       = [[United States]]\n|introduced   = 1985\n|discontinued =\n|related      = [[Coca-Cola Black Cherry Vanilla]]\n|variants     = Diet Coke Cherry, Coca-Cola Cherry Zero\n}}\n\n'''Coca-Cola Cherry''' (originally marketed as and still widely referred to as '''Cherry Coke''') is a [[cherry]]-flavored version of [[Coca-Cola]].

They are pioneers in the field of digital imaging and post-photography with projects exhibited at numerous venues including the 1995 Venice Biennale, the [[LA County Museum of Art]] and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].\n\n==Biography==\nAnthony Aziz received his BA from [[Boston College]] in 1983 and then went on to earn his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in 1990. Sammy Cucher received his BFA from [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1983 and then earned his MFA from SFAI in 1992. They live and work together in [[Brooklyn, NY]] and are both members of the faculty at [[Parsons The New School for Design]].\n\n==Work==\nAziz + Cucher have worked in many media including digital photography, video installation, sculpture, and textiles. They were among the first to use [[Adobe Photoshop]] in the context of [[fine art photography]]. The resulting series of images (1992\u20132002) can be seen as a commentary and reflection on the relationship between the human body and the technological forces that shape our society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.artpremium.com/motleys-the-only-wear/|title=ArtPremium \u2013 Motley\u2019s the Only Wear|last=|first=|date=2017-10-09|work=[[ArtPremium]]|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}</ref> In later projects (2003\u20132006), which grew to include video installation, their concerns shifted towards the way that our perception of nature and the landscape had been augmented and modified by technological mediation.\n\n==Significant examples==\n===The Dystopia series (1994-95)===\nConsists of large digitally manipulated portraits in which the orifices\u2014eyes, mouth and nostrils\u2014have been covered by a layer of skin. The intention was to suggest an evolutionary change signifying the loss of individuality in the face of advancing technology and the progressive disappearance of face-to-face, direct interaction.\n\n===Interior series (1999\u20132002)===\nThese are monumental images of architectural spaces seemingly constructed out of human skin. Created originally to metaphorically reflect the rapid proliferation of technological communications, these images have a haunting, lyrical quality which embodies the dichotomy between interior and exterior that will come to characterize their work subsequently.\n\n===Synaptic Bliss series (2003-07)===\nThe central piece in this series is a 4-channel video installation commissioned by the Festival Villette Numerique in Paris in 2004. The series is characterized by a shift in visual language from the human body to representing a landscape in which diverse forms are superimposed, becoming intertwined, and slowly emerging from an intensive colored flurry.

They are pioneers in the field of digital imaging and post-photography with projects exhibited at numerous venues including the 1995 Venice Biennale, the [[LA County Museum of Art]] and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].\n\n==Biography==\nAnthony Aziz received his BA from [[Boston College]] in 1983 and then went on to earn his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in 1990. Sammy Cucher received his BFA from [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1983 and then earned his MFA from SFAI in 1992. They live and work together in [[Brooklyn, NY]] and are both members of the faculty at [[Parsons The New School for Design]].\n\n==Work==\nAziz + Cucher have worked in many media including digital photography, video installation, sculpture, and textiles. They were among the first to use [[Adobe Photoshop]] in the context of [[fine art photography]]. The resulting series of images (1992\u20132002) can be seen as a commentary and reflection on the relationship between the human body and the technological forces that shape our society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.artpremium.com/motleys-the-only-wear/|title=ArtPremium \u2013 Motley\u2019s the Only Wear|last=|first=|date=2017-10-09|work=[[ArtPremium]]|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}</ref> In later projects (2003\u20132006), which grew to include video installation, their concerns shifted towards the way that our perception of nature and the landscape had been augmented and modified by technological mediation.\n\n==Significant examples==\n===The Dystopia series (1994-95)===\nConsists of large digitally manipulated portraits in which the orifices\u2014eyes, mouth and nostrils\u2014have been covered by a layer of skin. The intention was to suggest an evolutionary change signifying the loss of individuality in the face of advancing technology and the progressive disappearance of face-to-face, direct interaction.\n\n===Interior series (1999\u20132002)===\nThese are monumental images of architectural spaces seemingly constructed out of human skin. Created originally to metaphorically reflect the rapid proliferation of technological communications, these images have a haunting, lyrical quality which embodies the dichotomy between interior and exterior that will come to characterize their work subsequently.\n\n===Synaptic Bliss series (2003-07)===\nThe central piece in this series is a 4-channel video installation commissioned by the Festival Villette Numerique in Paris in 2004. The series is characterized by a shift in visual language from the human body to representing a landscape in which diverse forms are superimposed, becoming intertwined, and slowly emerging from an intensive colored flurry. Each individual shape seems in constant flux, becoming distinguished by a shift in tone, orientation, or size of its colored texture. The work in this series explores ideas of a digital consciousness that allows for the simultaneous perception of multiple perspectives and scales, as well as for the blurring of the distinctions between the body and its environment.\n\n==Important collections==\n*San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco\n*[[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], Los Angeles\n*Coleccion Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, Caracas-New York\n*C-Collection Switzerland, Lugano\n*Martin Z.

Not an ecologically dominant species, ''R. musicalis'' seems to be adapted to very specific environmental conditions.\n\n''R. musicalis'' has a unique life history. Its reproductive cycle more closely resembles mangroves than its fellow palms.The [[Iteroparity|pleonanthic]] palm flowers every year. ''R. musicalis'' is [[dioecious]], and female trees develop mature fruit during the wet season, in late February. Mature, floating fruits fall into the water where they are dispersed by the river away from the parent. Within each fruit is a single seed that begins to germinate while still inside the fruit. This seed is brown before germination and has a seed coat that is 0.2&nbsp;mm thick. Once germinated, the seeds develop a seed leaf that is hooked in shape. The fruit containing the germinated seed splits easily with slight disturbance. Once the fruit splits open, either by rot or collision, the seed will sink to the bottom and travel along the river floor until it catches upon a projection.<ref name=\":2\" /> The seedling will then begin to develop and take root. The seedlings will typically develop three to four leaves that increase in size as growth continues.<ref name=\":1\" /> The seedlings and the juvenile plants develop entirely underwater, remaining flaccid so as to not uproot in the river current. The young palm will emerge from the water and become rigid as the trunk develops.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Morphology==\n \nMature ''R. musicalis'' ranges from 2.5 to 8 meters tall. The bottle-shaped trunk tapers down, with the broadest diameter of about 0.5 meters occurring at water level. The wood is soft and cream colored. ''R. musicalis'' is the only species in the genus ''Ravenea'' that lacks a layer of dense, hard, vertical black fibers lining the outer part of the stem, thought to benefit the structural strength of the tree.\n\nFourteen to 16 [[pinnate]] ('feather-leaved') fronds emerge from the crown of the tree. They have been reported to reach up to 1.8 meters in length and have between 59 and 63 stiff leaflets, though the variation within the species can be considerable. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that is orange on the underside with thin, grey, [[Trichome|tomentum]]. On the top, the sheath is proximally orange near the [[rachis]] of the frond, and distally green. The leaves are [[Glossary of botanical terms|abaxially keeled]] with a glossy texture, and leaflets always occur within a single plane on either side of the rachis.\n\n[[Inflorescence]]s in the genus ''Ravenea'' are always interfoliar. ''R. musicalis'' is one of seven species in the genus observed to have apparent multiple [[staminate]] inflorescences, though, like the rest of its genus, it has solitary [[pistillate]] inflorescences. Whether or not any plants in the genus ''Ravenea'', including ''R. musicalis'' have true multiple inflorescence or false multiple inflorescence (a condensed branch system within a single [[prophyll]]) is debated. Staminate inflorescences occur in multiples of 5 and branch to 1 order. Pistillate inflorescences are solitary and branch to 1 order.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Flowers and fruit===\n\n''R. musicalis'' is dioecious and pleonanthic, like all Ravenea species.<ref name=\":0\" /> The flowers of ''R. musicalis'' open prior to the opening of the inflorescence.<ref name=\":1\" /> Little information exists on the flowers of this species, since no known expeditions took place during flowering season.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fruits of ''R. musicalis'' are orange and round, about 14\u201323&nbsp;mm in diameter. Though most fruits in the genus ''Ravenea'' have a fleshy [[mesocarp]], ''R. musicalis'' has a spongy mesocarp, allowing the fruits to float and rot. A single brown seed, which germinates within the fruit, is 10\u201314&nbsp;mm across with a hard, black seed coat.

Not an ecologically dominant species, ''R. musicalis'' seems to be adapted to very specific environmental conditions. \n\n''R. musicalis'' has a unique life history. Its reproductive cycle more closely resembles mangroves than its fellow palms.The [[Iteroparity|pleonanthic]] palm flowers every year. ''R. musicalis'' is [[dioecious]], and female trees develop mature fruit during the wet season, in late February. Mature, floating fruits fall into the water where they are dispersed by the river away from the parent. Within each fruit is a single seed that begins to germinate while still inside the fruit. This seed is brown before germination and has a seed coat that is 0.2 mm thick. Once germinated, the seeds develop a seed leaf that is hooked in shape. The fruit containing the germinated seed splits easily with slight disturbance. Once the fruit splits open, either by rot or collision, the seed will sink to the bottom and travel along the river floor until it catches upon a projection.<ref name=\":2\" /> The seedling will then begin to develop and take root. The seedlings will typically develop three to four leaves that increase in size as growth continues.<ref name=\":1\" /> The seedlings and the juvenile plants develop entirely underwater, remaining flaccid so as to not uproot in the river current. The young palm will emerge from the water and become rigid as the trunk develops.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Morphology==\n \nMature ''R. musicalis'' ranges from 2.5 to 8 meters tall. The bottle-shaped trunk tapers down, with the broadest diameter of about 0.5 meters occurring at water level. The wood is soft and cream colored. ''R. musicalis'' is the only species in the genus ''Ravenea'' that lacks a layer of dense, hard, vertical black fibers lining the outer part of the stem, thought to benefit the structural strength of the tree. \n\nFourteen to 16 [[pinnate]] ('feather-leaved') fronds emerge from the crown of the tree. They have been reported to reach up to 1.8 meters in length and have between 59 and 63 stiff leaflets, though the variation within the species can be considerable. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that is orange on the underside with thin, grey, [[Trichome|tomentum]]. On the top, the sheath is proximally orange near the [[rachis]] of the frond, and distally green. The leaves are [[Glossary of botanical terms|abaxially keeled]] with a glossy texture, and leaflets always occur within a single plane on either side of the rachis.\n\n[[Inflorescence|Inflorescences]] in the genus ''Ravenea'' are always interfoliar. ''R. musicalis'' is one of seven species in the genus observed to have apparent multiple [[staminate]] inflorescences, though, like the rest of its genus, it has solitary [[pistillate]] inflorescences. Whether or not any plants in the genus ''Ravenea'', including ''R. musicalis'' have true multiple inflorescence or false multiple inflorescence (a condensed branch system within a single [[prophyll]]) is debated. Staminate inflorescences occur in multiples of 5 and branch to 1 order. Pistillate inflorescences are solitary and branch to 1 order.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Flowers and fruit=== \n\n''R. musicalis'' is dioecious and pleonanthic, like all Ravenea species.<ref name=\":0\" /> The flowers of ''R. musicalis'' open prior to the opening of the inflorescence.<ref name=\":1\" /> Little information exists on the flowers of this species, since no known expeditions took place during flowering season.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nThe fruits of ''R. musicalis'' are orange and round, about 14-23 mm in diameter. Though most fruits in the genus ''Ravenea'' have a fleshy [[mesocarp]], ''R. musicalis'' has a spongy mesocarp, allowing the fruits to float and rot. A single brown seed, which germinates within the fruit, is 10-14 mm across with a hard, black seed coat.

They currently play in the [[Cymru South]], after two consecutive promotions as champions.\n\n==History<ref>[https://www.welshleague.org.uk/2014-15%20club%20info%20llantwit%20major1.pdf Welsh League Club History]</ref>==\nLlantwit Major Football Club was formed in 1962. A selection committee selected the team until entry to the [[South Wales Amateur League]] Second Division was gained in 1971. Life Member Gwyn John was appointed as the first team manager. Manager John's team were promoted to the 1st Division after finishing second in the 1976\u201377 season. Llantwit consolidated in the division before claiming their first Amateur League title under new manager Alan Foster in the 1979\u201380 season. This was closely followed by their second championship just a year later after retaining the title and adding the Corinthian Cup to achieve the double. This kick started a golden period in the 80's where the club won another double of league and Corinthian Cup in 1983\u201384. The hat-trick of Corinthian Cups came in the 1986\u201387 season. The club were also runners up in the league on a further two occasions during the decade. The 1990s by contrast was a very mixed period for the club, first relegation in 1991\u201392 under Rob Sherman's leadership, followed by promotion two years later with Steve Manning at the helm. Fast forward two years and relegation, this time with record appearance holder Pete Lingham as player/manager. However the club made sure they were in the first division again at the turn of the millennium, the management duo of Kev Pycroft and Phil Clay gaining promotion by winning a comfortable Second Division title. The club spent the next decade consistently flirting with the league title without ever looking like serious title contenders with Llantwit stalwarts Tim Watts and John Guy providing much needed stability in charge. The club also came runners up in the Corinthian Cup in 2005.  John Guy stepped down as manager in 2010 following a decade as manager to move upstairs as Chairman. Guy did this selflessly in order to allow the introduction of fresh ideas into the club from new boss Kevin Rees in partnership with Watts. Rees and Watts introduced flesh blood into the playing staff gaining instant success by lifting the SWFA Senior Cup in 2010\u201311. The bedrock of the new players was Darren Robinson who became player/coach/manager along with the irrepressible Watts.\n\n==Supporters and Rivalries==\n\nLlantwit Major supporters are known as the 'Windmill Army', and can draw crowds of up to 250 for important matches such as their 2018 title decider against STM Sports. For many years, the number one rival was St. Athan, however this rivalry has diminished due to Llantwit's rise through the leagues. Instead, Pen-Y-Bont FC have become the opposition most looked forward to by fans and players alike.\n\nMeanwhile, the club has friendly links with [[Bristol Rovers FC]] and Dutch club [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]].\n\n== Recent success (2016-onwards) ==\n\nLlantwit Major have enjoyed incredible success in recent years, rising from the amateur divisions to the second tier of Welsh football. Manager Karl Lewis has established a strong squad of players from the local area, many of whom have been playing together for their entire lives. The most notable success so far was lifting the [[Welsh Football League Division Two]] title in the 2017/18 season, in the club's first season at that level having been promoted from Division Three the season before. Former players Sam Snaith and Adam Roscrow have gone on to play in the [[Welsh Premier League]] with Cardiff Met, and the club also enjoyed a victory over Barry Town AFC \u2013 one of the biggest clubs in Wales.

They currently play in the [[Cymru South]], after two consecutive promotions as champions.\n\n==History<ref>[https://www.welshleague.org.uk/2014-15%20club%20info%20llantwit%20major1.pdf Welsh League Club History]</ref>==\nLlantwit Major Football Club was formed in 1962. A selection committee selected the team until entry to the [[South Wales Amateur League]] Second Division was gained in 1971. Life Member Gwyn John was appointed as the first team manager. Manager John's team were promoted to the 1st Division after finishing second in the 1976\u201377 season. Llantwit consolidated in the division before claiming their first Amateur League title under new manager Alan Foster in the 1979\u201380 season. This was closely followed by their second championship just a year later after retaining the title and adding the Corinthian Cup to achieve the double. This kick started a golden period in the 80's where the club won another double of league and Corinthian Cup in 1983\u201384. The hat-trick of Corinthian Cups came in the 1986\u201387 season. The club were also runners up in the league on a further two occasions during the decade. The 1990's by contrast was a very mixed period for the club, first relegation in 1991\u201392 under Rob Sherman's leadership, followed by promotion two years later with Steve Manning at the helm. Fast forward two years and relegation, this time with record appearance holder Pete Lingham as player/manager. However the club made sure they were in the first division again at the turn of the millennium, the management duo of Kev Pycroft and Phil Clay gaining promotion by winning a comfortable Second Division title. The club spent the next decade consistently flirting with the league title without ever looking like serious title contenders with Llantwit stalwarts Tim Watts and John Guy providing much needed stability in charge. The club also came runners up in the Corinthian Cup in 2005.  John Guy stepped down as manager in 2010 following a decade as manager to move upstairs as Chairman. Guy did this selflessly in order to allow the introduction of fresh ideas into the club from new boss Kevin Rees in partnership with Watts. Rees and Watts introduced flesh blood into the playing staff gaining instant success by lifting the SWFA Senior Cup in 2010\u201311. The bedrock of the new players was Darren Robinson who became player/coach/manager along with the irrepressible Watts.\n\n==Supporters and Rivalries==\n\nLlantwit Major supporters are known as the 'Windmill Army', and can draw crowds of up to 250 for important matches such as their 2018 title decider against STM Sports. For many years, the number one rival was St. Athan, however this rivalry has diminished due to Llantwit's rise through the leagues. Instead, Pen-Y-Bont FC have become the opposition most looked forward to by fans and players alike.\n\nMeanwhile, the club has friendly links with [[Bristol Rovers FC]] and Dutch club [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]].\n\n== Recent success (2016-onwards) ==\n\nLlantwit Major have enjoyed incredible success in recent years, rising from the amateur divisions to the second tier of Welsh football. Manager Karl Lewis has established a strong squad of players from the local area, many of whom have been playing together for their entire lives. The most notable success so far was lifting the [[Welsh Football League Division Two]] title in the 2017/18 season, in the club's first season at that level having been promoted from Division Three the season before. Former players Sam Snaith and Adam Roscrow have gone on to play in the [[Welsh Premier League]] with Cardiff Met, and the club also enjoyed a victory over Barry Town AFC \u2013 one of the biggest clubs in Wales. The Windmill Lane stadium has also seen improvements, with the addition of a new seating area and concrete standing areas, as well as improvements to the bar and clubhouse.\n\nFollowing a 4 - 3 victory over Pontypridd Town, Karl Lewis announced he would leave the club at the end of the season. Darren Robinson was announced as his replacement shortly after.\n\n== FAW Championship 2019/20 ==\n\nFor the 2019/20 season, Llantwit will be an inaugural member of the FAW Championship. A number of improvements were made to the ground and pitch to be ready for this campaign, with the highlight being the addition of a new main stand.\n\n== Honours<ref>[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/llantwitmajorfc/a/honours-27901.html Honours Section Old Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041755/http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/llantwitmajorfc/a/honours-27901.html |date=2014-09-24 }}</ref> ==\n\n*FAW Senior Cup Winners \u2013 2010\u201311\n*Welsh Football League Division Two Champions \u2013 2017\u201318\n*Welsh Football League Division Three Champions \u2013 2016\u201317\n*[[South Wales Amateur League]] Division 1 Champions \u2013 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381, 1983\u201384, 2011\u201312\n*[[South Wales Amateur League]] Division 2 Champions \u2013 1998\u201399\n*Corinthian Cup Winners \u2013 1980\u201381, 1983\u201384, 1986\u201387\n*Barry & District League Division 2 Champions \u2013 1984\u201385\n*Bridgend & District League Premier Division Cup Winners \u2013 1998\u201399\n*Bridgend & District League Division 1 Champions \u2013 1990\u201391\n*Bridgend & District League Division 1 Challenge Shield Winners \u2013 1992\u201393\n*Supporters Cup Winners \u2013 2010\u201311 \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140109092005/http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/llantwitmajorfc Old Pitchero Website]\n* [http://www.llantwitmajorafc.com Official Website]\n* [https://www.thatsnotllandudno.com 'That's not Llandudno' - fictional novel based on Llantwit Major AFC]\n{{FAW Championship South & Mid}}\n{{Football in Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Football clubs in Wales]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1962]]\n[[Category:Welsh Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Cymru South clubs]]\n[[Category:South Wales Amateur League clubs]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llantwit_Major_F.C."}

Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the ocean floor but are the home to many marine animals and over 4,000 fish on its own. Coral\u00a0reefs provide resources to over 500 million people in over 100 countries in the world and are great for the economy. Unfortunately, coral reefs are in great danger due to coral bleaching. Coral bleaching occurs when corals are presented with very stressful and harm conditions like temperature, light, or nutrients that causes them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues resulting them to turn completely white. Corals are healthy when a brownish tone is evident, but when a white tone is shown this is a sign of the bleaching that has occurred. Coral and algae depend on one another in order to survive and give off that healthy brown tone in a symbiont relationship, but when these corals are stressed the algae are forced to leave causing a change in color. When corals are bleached it doesn\u2019t mean they have died, they can survive the stress they experience through coral bleaching, but they are more susceptible to becoming vulnerable and mortality in the long run.Evidence shows that oceans are warming due to the rise in temperature that for the most part are due to greenhouse gases resulting from humans; an example of an anthropogenic disturbance. Corals, unfortunately, do not do well in very warm or cold waters since they release the algae (zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues. The different impacts include warming oceans, sea level rise, changes in storm patterns, changes in precipitation, altered ocean currents, and ocean acidification<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/welcome.html|title=NOAA's National Ocean Service|last=US Department of Commerce|first=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>. The influences combined, impact the services coral reefs provide.  \n\nCoral bleaching has occurred at a large scale all around the world. One major event of coral bleaching occurred in the United States where the Caribbean in 2005 lost more than half of its reefs. The ocean water centered in northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was too warm for the coral reefs that lead to extreme thermal stress<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralreef-climate.html|title=How does climate change affect coral reefs?|last=US Department of Commerce|first=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>. The thermal stress was recorded to be so large compared to all the stress of the previous 20 years combined. Another case of coral reefs being greatly affected happened near the Florida Keys where a large amount of corals died when the water temperatures dropped way to low that this cold- stress event lead to many different corals being impacted<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://floridakeys.noaa.gov/corals/climatethreat.html|title=How is climate change affecting coral reefs?|website=floridakeys.noaa.gov|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>. Thus, coral bleaching can occur at temperatures at either ends of the spectrum, too hot or too cold. \n\nGlobal warming is mainly known for rising temperatures, but along with the rising temperatures causing coral bleaching cascading events like changes in wind patterns, jet streams, and water circulation are occurring. If humans continue to mine and burn coal causing a release of carbon pollution into the air which is heating the Earth and warming the oceans. It was thought for a long time that the main cause for coral bleaching brought about direct anthropogenic effects like water pollution and sedimentation, but evidence has shown that anthropogenic global climate changes have dominated. About 50%-70% of these global climate changes are directly affecting these reefs which including the rising in temperature, increasing oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> (ocean acidification), changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. Research has shown that over the years there has been an increase of 1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C in sea surface temperature that has led to the mortality of so many reefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/the-effects-of-climate-change-on-coral-reef-health/|title=The Effects of Climate Change on Coral Reef Health|last=Haw|first=Jim|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>. For example, the reefs in Guam in the past 40 years have declined from 50% in 1960 and 25% in the 1990s. If these types of patterns continue, coral reefs will reach mortality quickly. Not only is coral bleaching affecting species diversity, but it is depleting resources that provide millions with medicine, food, protection, and funds from fishing and tourism.

On July 1, 2010, he announced in the introduction to his \"Consumer Guide\" column that the July 2010 installment would be his last on MSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.msn.com/music/consumerguide/ |title=Inside Music |publisher=MSN |last=Christgau |first=Robert |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302201445/http://music.msn.com/music/consumerguide/ |archive-date=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Christgau launched a blog on MSN, called \"Expert Witness\", which featured reviews only of albums that he had graded B+ or higher, since those albums \"are the gut and backbone of my musical pleasure\"; the writing of reviews for which are \"so rewarding psychologically that I'm happy to do it at blogger's rates\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=258264de-2519-4d38-a469-ca4742b3bf29&_blg=3 |title=This Blog\u2014The Whats, Whys, and Wherefores |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=November 22, 2010 |work=Expert Witness |publisher=MSN |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714124931/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=258264de-2519-4d38-a469-ca4742b3bf29&_blg=3 |archivedate=July 14, 2011  }}</ref> On September 20, 2013, Christgau announced in the comments section that Expert Witness would cease to be published by October 1, 2013, writing, \"As I understand it, Microsoft is shutting down the entire MSN freelance arts operation at that time&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--odds-and-ends-036 |title=Odds and Ends 036 |publisher=[[MSN Music]] |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |author=Christgau, Robert |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929004844/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--odds-and-ends-036 |archivedate=September 29, 2013  }}</ref> On September 10, 2014, he debuted a new version of ''Expert Witness'' on ''[[Cuepoint]]'', an online music magazine published on the blogging platform Medium.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/robert-christgau-expert-witness-299c3329fb6f | title=Expert Witness: The Story Till Now | work=[[Cuepoint]]| date=September 10, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2014 | author=Christgau, Robert}}</ref> In August 2015, the ''Expert Witness'' column was relocated to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine's ''Noisey'' section.<ref name=\"noisey\">{{cite web | url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-1 | title=Welcome to Expert Witness | work=Vice | date=August 13, 2015 | accessdate=August 14, 2015 | author=Christgau, Robert}}</ref>  His last column for ''Noisey'' was published in June 2019.<ref>https://www.robertchristgau.com/xgausez.php?d=2019-07-09</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, the final edition of \"Expert Witness\" was published.<ref name=\"xgausez070919\">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=July 9, 2019|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xgausez.php?d=2019-07-09|title=Xgau Sez|accessdate=September 29, 2019|website=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> In September, Christgau launched a paid-subscription newsletter called \"And It Don't Stop\", published on the email-newsletter platform Substack and featuring a monthly \"Consumer Guide\" column, among other writings.<ref name=\"hull091709\"/>\n\n===Pazz & Jop===\n{{Main|Pazz & Jop}}\nBetween 1968 and 1970, Christgau submitted ballots in ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'' magazine's annual critics' poll.

The poll surveyed music critics on their favorite releases of the year. The poll results were published in the ''Village Voice'' every February after compiling \"top ten\" lists submitted by music critics across the nation. Throughout Christgau's career at the ''Voice'', every poll was accompanied by a lengthy Christgau essay analyzing the results and pondering the year's overall musical output. The ''Voice'' continued the feature after Christgau's dismissal. Although he no longer oversaw the poll, Christgau continued to vote and, since the 2015 poll, also contributed essays to the results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/01/12/pazz-jop-2015-robert-christgau-joe-levy-ann-powers-and-greg-tate-on-the-year-that-was/|title=Pazz & Jop 2015, Robert Christgau, Joe Levy, Ann Powers and Greg Tate on the Year that Was|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=January 12, 2016|website=Villagevoice.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/critics/2010/684394/ |title=Music &#124; Latest News |newspaper=[[Village Voice]] |date=July 6, 2017 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====\"Dean's Lists\"====\nEach year that Pazz & Jop has run, Christgau has created a personal list of his favorite releases called the \"Dean's List\". Only his top ten count toward his vote in the poll, but his full lists of favorites usually numbered far more than that. These lists \u2013 or at least Christgau's top tens \u2013 were typically published in ''The Village Voice'' along with the Pazz & Jop results. After Christgau was dismissed from the ''Voice'', he continued publishing his annual lists on his own website and at ''[[The Barnes & Noble Review]]''.\n\nWhile Pazz & Jop's aggregate critics' poll are its main draw, Christgau's Deans' Lists are noteworthy in their own right. Henry Hauser from ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' said Christgau's \"annual 'Pazz & Jop' poll has been a bona fide American institution. For music writers, his year-end essays and extensive 'Dean's List' are like watching [[Times Square Ball|the big ball drop in Times Square]].\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hauser |first=Henry |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/04/going-into-the-city-portrait-of-the-critic-as-a-young-man-by-robert-christgau/ |title=Going into the City: Portrait of the Critic as a Young Man by Robert Christgau |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=April 18, 2015 |accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following are Christgau's choices for the number-one album of the year, including the point score he assigned for the poll. Pazz & Jop's rules provided that each item in a top ten could be allotted between 5 and 30 points, with all ten items totaling 100, allowing critics to [[Weighting|weight]] certain albums more heavily if they chose to do so. In some years, Christgau often gave an equal number of points to his first- and second-ranked albums, but they were nevertheless ranked as first and second, not as a tie for first; this list collects only his number-one picks.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!

On July 1, 2010, he announced in the introduction to his \"Consumer Guide\" column that the July 2010 installment would be his last on MSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.msn.com/music/consumerguide/ |title=Inside Music |publisher=MSN |last=Christgau |first=Robert |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302201445/http://music.msn.com/music/consumerguide/ |archive-date=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Christgau launched a blog on MSN, called \"Expert Witness\", which featured reviews only of albums that he had graded B+ or higher, since those albums \"are the gut and backbone of my musical pleasure\"; the writing of reviews for which are \"so rewarding psychologically that I'm happy to do it at blogger's rates\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=258264de-2519-4d38-a469-ca4742b3bf29&_blg=3 |title=This Blog\u2014The Whats, Whys, and Wherefores |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=November 22, 2010 |work=Expert Witness |publisher=MSN |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714124931/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=258264de-2519-4d38-a469-ca4742b3bf29&_blg=3 |archivedate=July 14, 2011  }}</ref> On September 20, 2013, Christgau announced in the comments section that Expert Witness would cease to be published by October 1, 2013, writing, \"As I understand it, Microsoft is shutting down the entire MSN freelance arts operation at that time&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--odds-and-ends-036 |title=Odds and Ends 036 |publisher=[[MSN Music]] |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |author=Christgau, Robert |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929004844/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--odds-and-ends-036 |archivedate=September 29, 2013  }}</ref> On September 10, 2014, he debuted a new version of ''Expert Witness'' on ''[[Cuepoint]]'', an online music magazine published on the blogging platform Medium.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/robert-christgau-expert-witness-299c3329fb6f | title=Expert Witness: The Story Till Now | work=[[Cuepoint]]| date=September 10, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2014 | author=Christgau, Robert}}</ref> In August 2015, the ''Expert Witness'' column was relocated to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine's ''Noisey'' section.<ref name=\"noisey\">{{cite web | url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-1 | title=Welcome to Expert Witness | work=Vice | date=August 13, 2015 | accessdate=August 14, 2015 | author=Christgau, Robert}}</ref>  His last column for ''Noisey'' was published in June 2019.<ref>https://www.robertchristgau.com/xgausez.php?d=2019-07-09</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, the final edition of \"Expert Witness\" was published.<ref name=\"xgausez070919\">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=July 9, 2019|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xgausez.php?d=2019-07-09|title=Xgau Sez|accessdate=September 29, 2019|website=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> In September, Christgau launched a paid-subscription newsletter called \"And It Don't Stop\", published on the email-newsletter platform Substack and featuring a monthly \"Consumer Guide\" column, among other writings.<ref name=\"hull091709\"/>\n\n===Pazz & Jop===\n{{Main|Pazz & Jop}}\nBetween 1968 and 1970, Christgau submitted ballots in ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'' magazine's annual critics' poll.

The poll surveyed music critics on their favorite releases of the year. The poll results were published in the ''Village Voice'' every February after compiling \"top ten\" lists submitted by music critics across the nation. Throughout Christgau's career at the ''Voice'', every poll was accompanied by a lengthy Christgau essay analyzing the results and pondering the year's overall musical output. The ''Voice'' continued the feature after Christgau's dismissal. Although he no longer oversaw the poll, Christgau continued to vote and, since the 2015 poll, also contributed essays to the results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/01/12/pazz-jop-2015-robert-christgau-joe-levy-ann-powers-and-greg-tate-on-the-year-that-was/|title=Pazz & Jop 2015, Robert Christgau, Joe Levy, Ann Powers and Greg Tate on the Year that Was|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=January 12, 2016|website=Villagevoice.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/critics/2010/684394/ |title=Music &#124; Latest News |newspaper=[[Village Voice]] |date=July 6, 2017 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====\"Dean's Lists\"====\nEach year that Pazz & Jop has run, Christgau has created a personal list of his favorite releases called the \"Dean's List\". Only his top ten count toward his vote in the poll, but his full lists of favorites usually numbered far more than that. These lists \u2013 or at least Christgau's top tens \u2013 were typically published in ''The Village Voice'' along with the Pazz & Jop results. After Christgau was dismissed from the ''Voice'', he continued publishing his annual lists on his own website and at ''[[The Barnes & Noble Review]]''.\n\nWhile Pazz & Jop's aggregate critics' poll are its main draw, Christgau's Deans' Lists are noteworthy in their own right. Henry Hauser from ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' said Christgau's \"annual 'Pazz & Jop' poll has been a bona fide American institution. For music writers, his year-end essays and extensive 'Dean's List' are like watching [[Times Square Ball|the big ball drop in Times Square]].\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hauser |first=Henry |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/04/going-into-the-city-portrait-of-the-critic-as-a-young-man-by-robert-christgau/ |title=Going into the City: Portrait of the Critic as a Young Man by Robert Christgau |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=April 18, 2015 |accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following are Christgau's choices for the number-one album of the year, including the point score he assigned for the poll. Pazz & Jop's rules provided that each item in a top ten could be allotted between 5 and 30 points, with all ten items totaling 100, allowing critics to [[Weighting|weight]] certain albums more heavily if they chose to do so. In some years, Christgau often gave an equal number of points to his first- and second-ranked albums, but they were nevertheless ranked as first and second, not as a tie for first; this list collects only his number-one picks.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!
