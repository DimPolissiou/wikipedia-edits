Interfacial rheology deals with the response of the adsorbed interfacial layer on the deformation. The response depends on the layer composition, and thus interfacial rheology is relevant in many applications in which adsorbed layer play a crucial role, for example in development surfactants, foams and emulsions.

Surfactants and surface active polymers used for stabilising emulsions and foams in food and cosmetic industries. Polymers, such as proteins, are surface active and tend to adsorb at the interface, where they can change conformation and influence the interfacial properties. Natural surfactants like asphaltenes and resins stabilize water-oil emulsions in crude oil applications, and by understanding their behavior the crude oil separation process can be enhanced.

Many biological systems like pulmonary lung surfactant and meibum are dependent on interfacial viscoelasticity for their functionality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leiske|first=Danielle L.|last2=Leiske|first2=Christopher I.|last3=Leiske|first3=Daniel R.|last4=Toney|first4=Michael F.|last5=Senchyna|first5=Michelle|last6=Ketelson|first6=Howard A.|last7=Meadows|first7=David L.|last8=Fuller|first8=Gerald G.|date=2012|title=Temperature-Induced Transitions in the Structure and Interfacial Rheology of Human Meibum|journal=Biophysical Journal|language=en|volume=102|issue=2|pages=369\u2013376|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2011.12.017|pmc=3260664|pmid=22339874|bibcode=2012BpJ...102..369L}}</ref>\n\nInterfacial rheology enables the study of surfactant kinetics, and the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed interfacial layer correlate well with emulsion and foam stability. Surfactants and surface active polymers used for stabilising emulsions and foams in food and cosmetic industries. Polymers, such as proteins, are surface active and tend to adsorb at the interface, where they can change conformation and influence the interfacial properties. Natural surfactants like asphaltenes and resins stabilize water-oil emulsions in crude oil applications, and by understanding their behavior the crude oil separation process can be enhanced. Also enhanced oil recovery efficiency can be optimized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ayirala|first=Subhash C.|last2=Al-Saleh|first2=Salah H.|last3=Al-Yousef|first3=Ali A.|date=2018|title=Microscopic scale interactions of water ions at crude oil/water interface and their impact on oil mobilization in advanced water flooding|journal=Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering|volume=163|pages=640\u2013649|doi=10.1016/j.petrol.2017.09.054|issn=0920-4105}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Rheology]]\n* [[Langmuir\u2013Blodgett trough|Langmuir trough]]\n* [[Tensiometer (surface tension)|Tensiometer]]\n* [[Surface tension]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://blog.biolinscientific.com/what-is-interfacial-rheology What is interfacial rheology]\n\n[[Category:Rheology]]\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfacial_rheology"}

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[murder of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the rest of the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of [frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songs], and [I was] intimidated. I thought it was best that I kept my songs to myself.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\">di Perna, Alan. \"Absolutely Foobulous!\". ''Guitar World''.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]].

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that.

The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including [[VH1 Rock Honors]] and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].\n\n=== ''One by One'' (2001\u20132004) ===\nNear the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record its [[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|fourth album]]. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].\n\nFor most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W. Bush]]'s presidential campaign was using \"Times Like These\" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to [[John Kerry]]'s campaign \u2013 \"There's no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry's people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense\".<ref name=xfm>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|title=X-clusive: Foo Fighters Vs President George W Bush|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=[[XFM]]|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828074927/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|archivedate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

The tour included members who had also performed with them in late 2005, such as former member [[Pat Smear]], who rejoined the band, [[Petra Haden]] on violin and backing vocals, [[Drew Hester]] on percussion, and [[Rami Jaffee]] of [[The Wallflowers]] on keyboard and piano. While much of the setlist focused on ''In Your Honor'''s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs, such as \"Ain't It The Life\", \"Floaty\", and \"See You\". The band also performed \"Marigold\", a ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]''-era song that was best known as a [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] B-side.\n\nIn November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, ''[[Skin and Bones (Foo Fighters album)|Skin and Bones]]'', featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stint in Los Angeles.\n\n=== ''Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace'' and ''Greatest Hits'' (2007\u20132009) ===\n[[File:Foo Fighters Live 21.jpg|thumb|The band performing live in 2007]]\n\nFor the follow-up to ''In Your Honor'', the band decided to call in ''The Colour and the Shape'' producer Gil Norton.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know?

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, \"[[This Is a Call]]\", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", \"[[For All the Cows]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\" were released as subsequent singles.

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that. But I thought, This is bullshit.\" Roberts, Michael. \"[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2 Bring Back That Sunny Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091941/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2/ |date=November 3, 2012 }}\".

The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him. Four months later in September at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], Smear simultaneously announced to the public his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]].<ref name=\"Kerrang 1997\">Johnson, Lisa. \"Classic interview: October 1997\".

A [[B-side]] from the \"My Hero\" single, \"Dear Lover\", appeared in the horror film ''[[Scream 2]]''. The tour for ''The Colour and the Shape'' album included a main stage performance at the 1998 [[Glastonbury Festival]] and culminated with a performance at the 1998 [[Reading Festival]], both in England.\n\n=== ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' (1998\u20132001) ===\nIn 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for their third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day.<ref name=\"Burn away\">Beebee, Steve. \"Burn Away\". ''Kerrang! Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref> The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'', in Grohl's Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including \"[[Learn to Fly]]\", the band's first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a \"key man clause\" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]], who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.<ref name=\"Burn away\" />\n\nAfter recording for ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on [[Chris Shiflett]], who performs with [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]], and previously performed with California punk band [[No Use for a Name]].

After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].\n\nFor most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W. Bush]]'s presidential campaign was using \"Times Like These\" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to [[John Kerry]]'s campaign \u2013 \"There's no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry's people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense\".<ref name=xfm>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|title=X-clusive: Foo Fighters Vs President George W Bush|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=[[XFM]]|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828074927/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|archivedate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Grohl said in 2005, \"I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.\" Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. \"Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK?

Aware of a previous romantic attraction between the two, Pendleton tells his thug Chalmer to follow Eddie on the trip, just in case.\n\nAt a nightclub and casino, Eddie saves the owner, Justin Keit, from some Chinese men attacking him. A grateful Justin invites him home and introduces Eddie to his fianc\u00e9e, Christine.\n\nEddie is bitter because Christine had run off to marry a criminal named Manard, who is now dead. In a moment to themselves, unaware that a jealous Justin is eavesdropping, Christine explains that she wed Manard only because he threatened to do Eddie harm. She also says Pendleton wants her back because Christine has hidden documents that could land Pendleton behind bars. He is reluctant to believe her.\n\nJustin, just to keep an eye on Eddie, offers him a job at the casino. There he befriends an Asian piano player named Allan.

A grateful Justin invites him home and introduces Eddie to his fiancee, Christine.\n\nEddie is bitter because Christine had run off to marry a criminal named Manard, who is now dead. In a moment to themselves, unaware that a jealous Justin is eavesdropping, Christine explains that she wed Manard only because he threatened to do Eddie harm.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''.

The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year.

Pollonnaruwa was the second administrative center of [[Rajarata]].\n\n==Founding==\nThe city is situated on the left bank of River [[Mahaweli]]. Archeological evidence and accounts in chronicles{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} suggests that the city is as old as [[Anuradhapura]]. The Vijithagama settlement made by Vijitha in 400 BCE is thought to be situated near the town.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==History==\nAfter ruling the country for over 1,400 years, the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura]] fell in 1017 to the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] [[Raja Raja Chola I|King RajaRaja]] and his son Rajendra, who took King Mahinda V as a captive to India where he died in 1029. The Cholas shifted the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]] and ruled Sri Lanka for 53 years. Polonnaruwa was named as Jananathapuram by the Cholas. King [[Vijayabahu I]] eventually defeated the Cholas and re-established the Sinhalese lineage. Polonnaruwa had previously been an important settlement in the country, as it commanded the crossings of the [[Mahaweli Ganga]] towards Anuradhapura.\n\nSome of the rulers of Polonnaruwa include [[Vijayabahu I]] and [[Parakramabahu I]] (Parakramabahu the Great). Most of Polonnaruwa that remains today dates from after the 1150s, as the extensive civil wars that preceded Parakramabahu's accession to the throne devastated the city. [[Parakrama Pandyan II]] from [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan Kingdom]] invaded the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa in the thirteenth century and ruled from 1212 to 1215 CE. He was succeeded by [[Kalinga Magha]] the founder of the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. Kalinga Magha ruled 21 years until he was expelled from Polonnaruwa in 1236.\n\n===Demise===\nThe Kingdom of Polonnaruwa was abandoned in the 14th century, and the seat of government for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings was moved to [[Kingdom of Dambadeniya|Dambadeniya]]. Although many factors contributed to this, the leading cause of the abandonment of Polonnaruwa was its susceptibility to invasions from south [[India]].\n\n==Trade==\nThe kings who ruled in Polonnaruwa engaged in foreign trade. During the period of king Parakramabahu I, Sri Lanka was self-sufficient in paddy and also had exported to many Southeast Asian countries as well as to India.\nThe people of Polonnaruwa had many of their requirements fulfilled except salt, which they had to bring from the coastal area.\n\n==Religion==\n[[Buddhism]] continued to be the main religion in Polonnaruwa era. Before the Sinhala kings' rule, there was a strong influence of [[Hinduism]] caused by Cholas. It is evident from the removal of cow shape in Polonnaruwa moonstone and also by the presence of Shiva temples in Polonnaruwa. After Chola rule a lot of vihars were renovated by Vijayabahu I and Parakramabahu I. Various divisions or Nikayas in Buddhism were united by Parakramabahu I.\n\n==Education==\nThe kings who ruled during this period built Buddhist schools for monks which were known as the Pirivena.\nAnd also the Brahmins were the only group which had the rights to have education.\nPali and the Sanskrit were the official languages.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Galvihara-sunny2.jpg|Buddha statues in Gal Vihara\nImage:Satmahal Prasada.jpg|Seven storeyed [[Satmahal Prasada]]\nImage:Polonnaruwa-temple19.jpg|Moonstone of Polonnaruwa\nImage:Polonnaruwa-panta.jpg|Parakrama Samudra built by king Parakramabahu I\nImage:Giritale tank.JPG|[[Giritale Tank]] was the deepest tank in Sri Lanka during Polonnaruwa era.\nImage:Polonnaruwa 0305.jpg| Shiva Devalaya in Polonnaruwa, dating back to the early years of [[Chola rule in Sri Lanka]].\nFile:Polonnaruwa Velaikkara Slab Inscription.jpg|Polonnaruwa velaikkara ([[Tamil script|Tamil]]) inscription of [[Vijayabahu I]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sri Lanka]]\n*[[History of Sri Lanka]]\n*[[List of Sri Lankan monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n*{{cite book | last =Paranavitana | first =Senarat |author2=Nicholas, Cyril Wace  | title =A Concise History of Ceylon | publisher =Ceylon University Press | year =1961 | location =Colombo | oclc = 465385  }}\n*von Schroeder, Ulrich.

Pollonnaruwa was the second administrative center of [[Rajarata]].\n\n==Founding==\nThe city is situated on the left bank of River [[Mahaweli]]. Archeological evidence and accounts in chronicles{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} suggests that the city is as old as [[Anuradhapura]]. The Vijithagama settlement made by Vijitha in 400 BCE is thought to be situated near the town.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==History==\nAfter ruling the country for over 1,400 years, the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura]] fell in 1017 to the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] [[Raja Raja Chola I|King RajaRaja]] and his son Rajendra, who took King Mahinda V as a captive to India where he died in 1029. The Cholas shifted the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]] and ruled Sri Lanka for 53 years. Polonnaruwa was named as Jananathapuram by the Cholas. King [[Vijayabahu I]] eventually defeated the Cholas and re-established the Sinhalese lineage. Polonnaruwa had previously been an important settlement in the country, as it commanded the crossings of the [[Mahaweli Ganga]] towards Anuradhapura.\n\nSome of the rulers of Polonnaruwa include [[Vijayabahu I]] and [[Parakramabahu I]] (Parakramabahu the Great). Most of Polonnaruwa that remains today dates from after the 1150s, as the extensive civil wars that preceded Parakramabahu's accession to the throne devastated the city. [[Parakrama Pandyan II]] from [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan Kingdom]] invaded the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa in the thirteenth century and ruled from 1212 to 1215 CE. He was succeeded by [[Kalinga Magha]] the founder of the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. Kalinga Magha ruled 21 years until he was expelled from Polonnaruwa in 1236.\n\n===Demise===\nThe Kingdom of Polonnaruwa was abandoned in the 14th century, and the seat of government for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings was moved to [[Kingdom of Dambadeniya|Dambadeniya]]. Although many factors contributed to this, the leading cause of the abandonment of Polonnaruwa was its susceptibility to invasions from south [[India]].\n\n==Trade==\nThe kings who ruled in Polonnaruwa engaged in foreign trade.

He has focussed on the biased projections that the media has created for minority religious and ethnic groups within the country\u2014and tried to compare them with similar prejudices against internal ethnic groups in Pakistan (Punjabi and Urdu cinema; textbooks), the USA (including US cinema and TV), the UK, Turkey, Indonesia, Europe (French cinema; permission to wear religion-appropriate clothing) and Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=1535 |title=Twisted notions & strange biases |first=Humra |last=Quraishi |work=Millennium Post |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Books ==\nDewan has published twenty books till date,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spoke.com/info/pAjRhzm/ParwezDewan |title=Parvez Dewan |first= |last=Bio |publisher=spoke.com |accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> some of which are listed in the table below\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!S.No. !!

During the same period, for ''Youth Times'' [a Times of India publication] he reviewed music (mainly Western popular and classical) and did the Hodge Podge column under the pseudonym Ponga Muni.\n\n''Indian Express''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/maruti-message/861322|title= Maruti message|website=Indian Express |date=16 December 2012}}</ref> wrote about Dewan:\n\nParvez Dewan seems to have that rare quality to poke fun at himself. On the author\u2019s profile page of his latest book on Kashmir, this J&K IAS officer has candidly revealed some interesting facts about himself. <blockquote>''\u201cMost of the publications that Parvez has written for have folded up (''Youth Times'', ''JS'', The Hindustan Times ''Evening News'', ''The Metropolitan on Saturday'', ''Shama'' (Urdu) and such sections of ''The Times of India'' as he regularly contributed to)\u201d, it mentions. \u201cThe venerable ''Illustrated Weekly of India'' wrote a long story about how Parvez created the Ladakh Festival in difficult circumstances. That was its last issue,\u201d''</blockquote> it carries on.\n\nAt another point, it talks about two of his \u2018libretti\u2019 having been recorded as rock operas in Denmark, and a third telecast on Britain\u2019s Channel Four, adding: \"And none of the three was ever heard of again.\"\n\nA fourth pop-opera, ''Sanober and the Slave'' has had somewhat better luck. In 2012 it spent more than three months at no. 1 on reverbnation.com's DK charts for Indie (Independent), thanks to the much acclaimed music of Kim Barner, his Danish partner in rhyme. The complete lyrics/ libretto/ book can be read at http://sanoberandtheslave.blogspot.com/; the complete musical with music and vocals can be heard at reverbnation.com/barner\n\n== Libretti/ lyrics ==\nDewan has written some libretti.
