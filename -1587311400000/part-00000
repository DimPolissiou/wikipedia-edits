He is questioned by Captain Blasi (Sordi), but gives only his name, rank and serial number. A British night attack is repulsed, but Italian Major Fornari is killed, leaving Blasi in charge. As time goes on, Blasi and Richardson come to irritate each other.\n\nBlasi decides to let the two escape to tell their superiors how ineffectual his force actually is in the hope that the British will not think them worth bothering about. However, Richardson is ordered to take his motorized squadron and round up Blasi's unit. Blasi and his men reach a fort, where supposedly the rest of their forces are rallying, but they find only abandoned equipment. Minutes later, Richardson's armored cars show up. Blasi, under the prodding of his friend Bernasconi, reluctantly agrees to surrender, though he is angry at what he considers his betrayal at Richardson's hands. He balks at Richardson's terms and has his Italian infantrymen sneak out the back, ordering most of his African soldiers to remain behind and surrender in an hour given as a deadline.\n\nFurious at being made a fool of, Richardson chases them into hilly terrain, against Captain Rootes' advice. After Blasi dismisses four African tribal warriors for misbehaving, they sneak behind the British and set a fire in the forest which destroys their armored cars and supplies. Both sides flee to an island in a nearby lake.\n\nAfter the fire dies down, they start marching across the desert, the outnumbered Italians as prisoners of war. When they reach a native village, the headman states he supports the Allied side and asks for the Italians' weapons and the Italians themselves, but Richardson refuses to part with either. They stop in an abandoned village because a British officer is too sick to be moved, only to find themselves surrounded by many hostile natives, led by the headman Richardson dealt with before. While they wait, Richardson and Blasi become acquainted. Richardson makes the decision to arm the Italians, but then discovers they left the Italian ammunition behind. He decides to have everyone sneak away, six at a time, down a gully, but that just makes it easier for the natives to capture them. After their weapons and boots are stolen, they are allowed to leave and take their war away with them.\n\nThey reach a road. Blasi is delighted to find a road sign that indicates they are 150 miles behind Italian lines. He and his men march away. Shortly afterward, however, Richardson encounters a British convoy on its way to a victory celebration; the Italians have been defeated. Blasi and his men are recaptured.

It\u2019s the little things: the nearly untraceable Indian accent, the mumbled exclamations in a different language, the slight gestures and paranoiac side-eyes of the Indian aunty, the seemingly effortless bridging of the paradox between ancient tradition and modern necessity. It would not have been difficult to cast Nalini as a monster, and often, Devi\u2019s inclined to think of her mother as her biggest obstacle. But Ramakrishnan and Jagannathan play off of each other beautifully, in a locked battle of wills that seems frustrating for both of them but indicates just how much attitude and verve they have in common.

It\u2019s the little things: the nearly untraceable Indian accent, the mumbled exclamations in a different language, the slight gestures and paranoiac side-eyes of the Indian aunty, the seemingly effortless bridging of the paradox between ancient tradition and modern necessity. It would not have been difficult to cast Nalini as a monster, and often, Devi\u2019s inclined to think of her mother as her biggest obstacle. But Ramakrishnan and Jagannathan play off of each other beautifully, in a locked battle of wills that seems frustrating for both of them but indicates just how much attitude and verve they have in common. Along with Moorjani, Never Have I Ever creates a triangle of Indian-American womanhood, the better to inhabit it\u2014and to dissect its contradictions.\"<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/never-have-i-ever-review-mindy-kaling?fbclid=IwAR2E7ognZjO0W0SUtGPeSwPjtuUpRd5-0afnC-yUX1NX1E1Qj7E6E14tzH4</ref>\n\nHer performance in ''[[The Night Of]]'' also received positive reviews; Vinnie Mancuso of Observer wrote, \"Poorna Jagannathan, who has been putting in one of the year's most heartbreaking performances, continues to shine.....\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/08/was-hbos-the-night-of-a-masterpiece-there-is-reasonable-doubt/|title=Was HBO's 'The Night Of' a Masterpiece?

It was founded in 1958 by choreographer and dancer [[Alvin Ailey]].  It is made up of 32 dancers, led by artistic director [[Robert Battle]] and associate artistic director Matthew Rushing.\n\n==History==\nAlvin Ailey and a group of young Black modern dancers first performed at New York's 92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association ([[92nd Street Y]]), under the name Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT), in March 1958. Ailey was the company's director, choreographer, and principal dancer. The company started as an ensemble of only seven dancers, plus their choreographer, and many guest choreographers.<ref name=IED>\u201cAlvin Ailey American Dance Theatre: Origins to 1979\u201d, ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', vol. 1. Oxford University Press, New York: 1979. 54-57.</ref> Following their first performance, which included Ailey's ''Blues Suite'', the company traveled on what were known as the \"station wagon tours\"; in 1960, the AAADT became a resident company of the [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]] [[YWCA]]'s Clark Center for the Performing Arts. During this period Ailey choreographed his famous work ''[[Revelations (Alvin Ailey)|Revelations]]'', a character dance done to traditional music. In 1962, Ailey changed his all-black dance company into a multi-racial group, believing that there was a kind of reverse chauvinism to anything all black.<ref name=IED /> In that same year, the company was chosen to tour the Far East, Southeast Asia and [[Australia]] as part of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s \"President's Special International Program for Cultural Presentations\". AAADT was the first \"Black\" company to travel for Kennedy's program. [[Judith Jamison]], a star of the company for 15 years, joined the company in 1965.\n\nAiley established a school in 1969, the same year that the company moved to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].  Both company and school relocated to 229 East 59th Street in Manhattan a year later, to a renovated church building.  In April of that year, a financial crisis caused Ailey to issue a statement that the dissolution of the company might take place.  The crisis abated, however, and in 1971 AAADT made its first performance at the [[New York City Center]], where it is currently the resident company. Masazumi Chaya, who later served as Associate Artistic Director for 28 years, first joined the company as a dancer in 1972.\n\nAAADT, the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble (later renamed Ailey II), and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center (later renamed The Ailey School) relocated in 1980 to four new studios in a building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].  The company celebrated its 25th anniversary three years later. Alvin Ailey died on December 1, 1989; before his death he selected Judith Jamison to succeed him as artistic director,<ref name=Henderson/> and the entire Ailey organization moved to 211 West 61st Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  The Ailey School and nearby Fordham College at Lincoln Center (FCLC), [[Fordham University]], have since affiliated to offer a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (BFA) degree program.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/fields_of_study/bfa_dance/aileyfordham_partner_22314.asp]\n</ref>\n\nMany arts organizations have experienced stresses upon the death of their founding artistic director.  Many people have contributed to the success of AAADT, but the work of [[Michael Kaiser]], the executive director from 1990 to 1993, is often cited<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://artsmanager.org/lessons/alvin_ailey.cfm |title=Artsmanager |access-date=2006-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006040413/http://www.artsmanager.org/lessons/alvin_ailey.cfm |archive-date=2006-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.danceusa.org/meetings/kaiser2002.html DanceUSA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210201206/http://www.danceusa.org/meetings/kaiser2002.html |date=2006-12-10 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030310/10kaiser.htm U.S.News, March 10, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007141324/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030310/10kaiser.htm |date=October 7, 2012 }}</ref> as a model of successful [[nonprofit]] performing arts management.\n\nFollowing tours in [[Russia]], [[France]] and [[Cuba]] in the 1990s, as well as a residency in [[South Africa]] in 1997, the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation announced in 2001 that a new dance complex was to be developed.

Among these performances are included two South African residencies. The company has often been an ambassador for American culture, starting with President John F. Kennedy's Southeast Asia tour program. The troupe toured southeast Asia and Australia in 1962, and performed in the International Arts Festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], in 1963. They performed at the first [[World Festival of Black Arts|World Festival of Negro Arts]] in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], in 1966. The same year, AAADT performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]], earning awards for \"best choreographer\", and \"best company\". They were also awarded \"best male dancer\" at the International Dance Festival in [[Paris]] in 1970, the same year that they did a six-city tour of the [[USSR]].<ref name=IED /> The company and its dancers and artistic staff have been recognized as cultural ambassadors numerous times, as in the 2001 awarding of the [[National Medal of Arts]] to both Judith Jamison and the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation.<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#01 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> In 2008, the United States Congress passed a resolution officially designating the company a \"vital American Cultural Ambassador to the World.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-resolution/1088|title=H.Res.1088 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Recognizing and commending the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 50 years of service as a vital American cultural ambassador to the world.|last=Nadler|first=Jerrold|date=2008-07-15|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-resolution/72|title=S.Res.72 - 112th Congress (2011-2012): A resolution recognizing the artistic and cultural contributions of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the 50th Anniversary of the first performance of Alvin Ailey's masterwork, \"Revelations\".|last=Gillibrand|first=Kirsten E.|date=2011-02-17|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-resolution/490|title=S.Res.490 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): A resolution recognizing the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 50 years of service to the performing arts.|last=Clinton|first=Hillary Rodham|date=2008-09-23|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nFounder Alvin Ailey created more than 79 dances for his company during his tenure; he also maintained, however, that the company was not solely a repository for his choreography. Hence AAADT has a repertory of more than 200 works by more than 70 choreographers, including [[Ulysses Dove]], [[Karole Armitage]], [[George Faison]], Uri Sands, Elisa Monte, [[Talley Beatty]], [[Katherine Dunham]], [[Donald Byrd (choreographer)|Donald Byrd]], and [[Twyla Tharp]] (whose work ''The Golden Section,'' excerpted from her larger ballet, ''[[The Catherine Wheel (album)|The Catherine Wheel]]'', entered AAADT's repertory in 2006). The company's popularity comes from its theatrical, extroverted style of dancers with strong personalities and muscular skill. Yet the majority of AAADT's pieces have not held the stage for more than a few seasons, and comparatively few have managed to reach critical acclaim. However, the company keeps Alvin Ailey's works, including ''Revelations'' (1960), ''Night Creature'' (1974) and ''Cry'' (1971), in continuous performance. ''Memoria'' was one of Alvin Ailey's balletic pieces, with long lines and a clear technical style different from his usual jazz character style of swirling patters, strong, driving arm movements, huge jumps, and thrusting steps. This dance was later adopted into the repertory of the Royal Danish Ballet. ''Cry'' is a three-part, 20-minute solo created for Judith Jamison. It was meant to pay homage to all Black women, and can be seen as a journey from degradation to pride, defiance, and survival.<ref name=IED /> ''Cry'' has great physical and emotional demands on both performer and audience.\n\nBattle has expanded the company's repertory in significant ways, adding works by established choreographers such as [[Garth Fagan]], [[Jiri Kylian]], [[Wayne McGregor]], [[Ohad Naharin]] and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], and commissioning new dances from contemporary choreographers including [[Kyle Abraham]] and [[Aszure Barton]].   In 2011, Battle also established a New Directions Choreography Lab to nurture emerging artists.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Culture of New York City]]\n*[[Carmen De Lavallade]]\n*[[Mel Tomlinson]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Henderson>{{cite news\n | last =Henderson\n | first =Danielle\n | title =Life Is a Celebration\n | newspaper =The Stranger\n | location =Seattle, United States\n | pages =\n | publisher =\n | date =11 April 2014\n | url =http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/life-is-a-celebration/Content?oid=19254483\n | accessdate = 13 April 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater}}\n* [http://www.alvinailey.org/ Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater website]\n* [https://www.alvinailey.org/repertory Repertory of the Company]\n* [https://www.alvinailey.org/about/history History and Timeline of the Company]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/AileyOrganization Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Channel on YouTube]\n* [http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/fields_of_study/bfa_dance/aileyfordham_partner_22314.asp Fordham University Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program affiliation]\n*[https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/alvin-ailey/i-wanna-be-ready-from-revelations/ Archival footage of Matthew Rushing performing in Alvin Ailey's ''Revelations'' in 2007 at Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival]\n*[https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/alvin-ailey/wade-in-the-water-from-revelations/ Archival footage of Ailey II performing in Alvin Ailey's ''Revelations'' in 1988 at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival]\n* {{Worldcat id|lccn-n78-5297}}\n* Map: {{Coord|40|46|01|N|73|59|13|W|format=dms|display=inline,title|type:landmark_region:US-NY}}\n\n{{African-American dance}}\n{{Dance Companies in the United States}}\n{{National Medal of Arts recipients 2000s}}\n\n[[Category:1958 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Modern dance companies]]\n[[Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients]]\n[[Category:African-American dance]]\n[[Category:African-American culture]]\n[[Category:Dance companies in New York City]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Alvin_Ailey_American_Dance_Theater_(48269597276).jpg|thumb|300px|Theatre at 405 West 55th Street at Ninth Avenue]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:H 4 ill 792495 alvin-ailey.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dancer Clifton Brown in a promotional poster for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater{{ffdc|1=H 4 ill 792495 alvin-ailey.jpg|log=2016 May 19}}]] -->\n\nThe '''Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater''' ('''AAADT''') is a [[modern dance]] [[dance company|company]] based in [[New York, New York]].

They were also awarded \"best male dancer\" at the International Dance Festival in [[Paris]] in 1970, the same year that they did a six-city tour of the [[USSR]].<ref name=IED /> The company and its dancers and artistic staff have been recognized as cultural ambassadors numerous times, as in the 2001 awarding of the [[National Medal of Arts]] to both Judith Jamison and the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation.<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#01 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> In 2008, the United States Congress passed a resolution officially designating the company a \"vital American Cultural Ambassador to the World.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-resolution/1088|title=H.Res.1088 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Recognizing and commending the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 50 years of service as a vital American cultural ambassador to the world.|last=Nadler|first=Jerrold|date=2008-07-15|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-resolution/72|title=S.Res.72 - 112th Congress (2011-2012): A resolution recognizing the artistic and cultural contributions of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the 50th Anniversary of the first performance of Alvin Ailey's masterwork, \"Revelations\".|last=Gillibrand|first=Kirsten E.|date=2011-02-17|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-resolution/490|title=S.Res.490 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): A resolution recognizing the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 50 years of service to the performing arts.|last=Clinton|first=Hillary Rodham|date=2008-09-23|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nFounder Alvin Ailey created more than 79 dances for his company during his tenure; he also maintained, however, that the company was not solely a repository for his choreography. Hence AAADT has a repertory of more than 200 works by more than 70 choreographers, including [[Ulysses Dove]], [[Karole Armitage]], [[George Faison]], Uri Sands, Elisa Monte, [[Talley Beatty]], [[Katherine Dunham]], [[Donald Byrd (choreographer)|Donald Byrd]], and [[Twyla Tharp]] (whose work ''The Golden Section,'' excerpted from her larger ballet, ''[[The Catherine Wheel (album)|The Catherine Wheel]]'', entered AAADT's repertory in 2006). The company's popularity comes from its theatrical, extroverted style of dancers with strong personalities and muscular skill. Yet the majority of AAADT's pieces have not held the stage for more than a few seasons, and comparatively few have managed to reach critical acclaim. However, the company keeps Alvin Ailey's works, including ''Revelations'' (1960), ''Night Creature'' (1974) and ''Cry'' (1971), in continuous performance. ''Memoria'' was one of Alvin Ailey's balletic pieces, with long lines and a clear technical style different from his usual jazz character style of swirling patters, strong, driving arm movements, huge jumps, and thrusting steps. This dance was later adopted into the repertory of the Royal Danish Ballet. ''Cry'' is a three-part, 20-minute solo created for Judith Jamison. It was meant to pay homage to all Black women, and can be seen as a journey from degradation to pride, defiance, and survival.<ref name=IED /> ''Cry'' has great physical and emotional demands on both performer and audience.\n\nBattle has expanded the company's repertory in significant ways, adding works by established choreographers such as [[Garth Fagan]], [[Jiri Kylian]], [[Wayne McGregor]], [[Ohad Naharin]] and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], and commissioning new dances from contemporary choreographers including [[Kyle Abraham]] and [[Aszure Barton]].   In 2011, Battle also established a New Directions Choreography Lab to nurture emerging artists.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Culture of New York City]]\n*[[Carmen De Lavallade]]\n*[[Mel Tomlinson]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Henderson>{{cite news\n | last =Henderson\n | first =Danielle\n | title =Life Is a Celebration\n | newspaper =The Stranger\n | location =Seattle, United States\n | pages =\n | publisher =\n | date =11 April 2014\n | url =http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/life-is-a-celebration/Content?oid=19254483\n | accessdate = 13 April 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater}}\n* [http://www.alvinailey.org/ Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater website]\n* [https://www.alvinailey.org/repertory Repertory of the Company]\n* [https://www.alvinailey.org/about/history History and Timeline of the Company]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/AileyOrganization Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Channel on YouTube]\n* [http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/fields_of_study/bfa_dance/aileyfordham_partner_22314.asp Fordham University Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program affiliation]\n*[https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/alvin-ailey/i-wanna-be-ready-from-revelations/ Archival footage of Matthew Rushing performing in Alvin Ailey's ''Revelations'' in 2007 at Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival]\n*[https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/alvin-ailey/wade-in-the-water-from-revelations/ Archival footage of Ailey II performing in Alvin Ailey's ''Revelations'' in 1988 at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival]\n* {{Worldcat id|lccn-n78-5297}}\n* Map: {{Coord|40|46|01|N|73|59|13|W|format=dms|display=inline,title|type:landmark_region:US-NY}}\n\n{{African-American dance}}\n{{Dance Companies in the United States}}\n{{National Medal of Arts recipients 2000s}}\n\n[[Category:1958 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Modern dance companies]]\n[[Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients]]\n[[Category:African-American dance]]\n[[Category:African-American culture]]\n[[Category:Dance companies in New York City]]\n", "name_user": "Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Ailey_American_Dance_Theater"}
