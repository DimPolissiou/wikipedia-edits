She shares with her fairy attendants that she is fearful that her daughter will suffer a great love trial within the first 10,000 years of her life. To keep her daughter safe and from meeting the same fate as herself, she does two things: first, she gives Jin Mi a magical pill to keep her from feeling and expressing romantic love; second, she forbids her attendants from divulging Jin Mi\u2019s identity as the daughter of the Floral Goddess to anyone. The Floral Goddess then passes away, tearfully leaving her daughter in the care of the Floral Fairies.\n\nDespite consuming the pill and the protection of the Floral Fairies, Jin Mi unwittingly becomes entangled in a love triangle involving two brothers, Fire God Xufeng and Night God Runyu, sons of the Heavenly Emperor. Outside forces push and pull the three to and from another, culminating at the wedding of Jin Mi and Runyu. During her and Runyu\u2019s wedding ceremony, Jin Mi stabs Xufeng because she mistakenly believes he is the one who killed her father and stepmother. It is at this moment that the magical pill shatters, allowing Jin Mi to realize that she loves Xufeng. Runyu also successfully ascends the throne of the Heavenly Realm when his father dies. \n\nJin Mi does everything she can to bring Xufeng back to life, even giving up her ability to see color, but after doing so, finds that he treats her coldly. Xufeng becomes Demon King and continues to ignore her attempts to explain the truth and her romantic feelings for him, instead turning his attention to Suihe, who has desired to be his bride since they were young. Eventually, Suihe admits to killing Jin Mi\u2019s father and stepmother after being confronted with evidence and is banished. Xufeng is tricked into marrying a spellbound Jin Mi but their love is revealed to be true. This invokes the wrath of Runyu, who brings a large army to force Jin Mi to come back with him and honor a marriage agreement between their fathers. A war breaks out. \n\nJin Mi, finally understanding her fate, sacrifices herself to end the war by jumping in the middle of the brothers\u2019 powerful attacks. After her death, the two make amends and Xufeng encourages Runyu to remain Heavenly Emperor. Wishing to be reunited with Jin Mi, Xufeng leaves the Demon Realm and searches for her. Eventually, Jin Mi is reborn as a mortal and Xufeng finds her, intercepting her when she is about to marry someone else. She still has her memories from when she was a fairy but no longer can see color after giving it up for Xufeng\u2019s revival. They become husband and wife and are shown to have a son, Tang Yue, who narrates the epilogue.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:20%\"|Character !!

She shares with her fairy attendants that she is fearful that her daughter will suffer a great love trial within the first 10,000 years of her life. To keep her daughter safe and from meeting the same fate as herself, she does two things: first, she gives Jin Mi a magical pill to keep her from feeling and expressing romantic love; second, she forbids her attendants from divulging Jin Mi\u2019s identity as the daughter of the Floral Goddess to anyone. The Floral Goddess then passes away, tearfully leaving her daughter in the care of the Floral Fairies.\n\nDespite consuming the pill and the protection of the Floral Fairies, Jin Mi unwittingly becomes entangled in a love triangle involving two brothers, Fire God Xufeng and Night God Runyu, sons of the Heavenly Emperor. Outside forces push and pull the three to and from another, culminating at the wedding of Jin Mi and Runyu. During her and Runyu\u2019s wedding ceremony, Jin Mi stabs Xufeng because she mistakenly believes he is the one who killed her father and stepmother. It is at this moment that the magical pill shatters, allowing Jin Mi to realize that she loves Xufeng. Runyu also successfully ascends the throne of the Heavenly Realm when his father dies. \n\nJin Mi does everything she can to bring Xufeng back to life, even giving up her ability to see color, but after doing so, finds that he treats her coldly. Xufeng becomes Demon King and continues to ignore her attempts to explain the truth and her romantic feelings for him, instead turning his attention to Suihe, who has desired to be his bride since they were young. Eventually, Suihe admits to killing Jin Mi\u2019s father and stepmother after being confronted with evidence and is banished. Xufeng is tricked into marrying a spellbound Jin Mi but their love is revealed to be true. This invokes the wrath of Runyu, who brings a large army to force Jin Mi to come back with him and honor a marriage agreement between their fathers. A war breaks out. \n\nJin Mi, finally understanding her fate, sacrifices herself to end the war by jumping in the middle of the brothers\u2019 powerful attacks. After her death, the two make amends and Xufeng encourages Runyu to remain Heavenly Emperor. Wishing to be reunited with Jin Mi, Xufeng leaves the Demon Realm and searches for her. Eventually, Jin Mi is reborn as a mortal and Xufeng finds her, intercepting her when she is about to marry someone else. She still has her memories from when she was a fairy but no longer can see color after giving it up for Xufeng\u2019s revival. They become husband and wife and are shown to have a son, Tang Yue, who narrates the epilogue.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:20%\"|Character !!

The vehicle can both pump the fuel in its tank into the recipient air platform, and can also pump fuel out of a tank on another vehicle and pump it to a different point. The vehicle is capable of refuelling up to four aircraft, either simultaneously or separately.\nThe tank has been designed on an incline to fully transfer the fuel when necessary, and contains baffles to prevent sloshing while on the move. The tank body is made of aluminium alloy and is coated with a ballistic sealing material and fire-retardant paint.

It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 8, 2015, and was released on September 16, 2015. It was succeeded by [[iOS 10]] on September 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10 With Redesigned Lock Screen, New Messages Features, Third-Party Siri, and More |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 13, 2016 |access-date=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228010133/http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\niOS 9 incorporated many feature updates to built-in apps. Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

The system's primary [[Gamepad|controller]] is the [[Wii U GamePad]], which features an embedded [[touchscreen]], directional buttons, analog sticks, and action buttons. The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to [[Off-TV Play|play the game directly on the GamePad]]. The [[Wii U Pro Controller]] can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative. The Wii U is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with all Wii software and accessories.

Despite its rural origin, it has found a second home in [[Shanghai]], China's most affluent city, where it managed to out-compete both Peking opera and the native [[Shanghai opera]]. Besides Shanghai and Zhejiang, major markets are found in [[Jiangsu]] and [[Fujian]], while hundreds of troupes still operate all over China. Like its performers, Yue opera fans are mainly women, resulting in a disproportionate number of love stories in its repertoire and very little acrobatic fighting.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Shaoxing opera actress Cai Yan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A female contestant playing [[Han Shizhong]] during a televised Shaoxing opera talent competition in 2006.]]\n[[File:Zhui Yu 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A performance of ''[[Yulan Ji]]'' by [[Shanghai Theatre Academy]] students in 2014.]]\n[[File:Wang Kui Betrays Guiying Shaoxing Opera 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A performance of ''[[Wang Kui Betrays Guiying]]'' by [[Shanghai Theatre Academy]] students in 2014.

A ''[[yangqin]]'' player, several ''[[huqin]]'' players, a percussionist, a [[cellist]], and a \"conductor\" can be seen.]]\n\n===Pre-history===\nPrior to 1906, the antecedent to Yue opera was story-singing. It was initially an entertainment for people in [[Sheng County]]. Its lyrics are mostly collected from conversations between farmers while they were working. Audiences loved these ballads because of their vivid description of daily life. The [[Second Opium War]] interfered with the local economy of Sheng County, located in the [[Jiangnan]] area, near [[Shanghai]]. Since Sheng County agriculturalists were experiencing difficulty earning their livelihoods, they started to turn this folk art into a second source of income.\n\nOver years, the accumulation of lyrics built up the fundamental source materials for Yue opera, and the folk music gradually developed its own style. Performers also began to integrate simple acting and accompanying instruments into the folk music. It gradually became well known, both in Sheng County and neighboring counties.\n\n===Beginnings===  \nAccording to oral history passed down by Yue Opera practitioners, Yue Opera began in 1906.<ref name=\":1\" /> At the end of the first month of the lunar year [[Zh\u0113ngyu\u00e8]] ([[simplified Chinese]]:\u6b63\u6708) in 1906, artists gathered together in Chen Wanyuan ([[simplified Chinese]]: \u9648\u4e07\u5143)'s house. Although these artists usually only performed in groups of two or three and had never performed together before, Chen and other residents encouraged them to put on a joint production instead of multiple separate retelling of the stories.<ref name=\":1\" /> The first performance was thus generated. The show turned out to be a great success, and residents were delighted and willing to talk about it.\n\nOver time more and more counties invited them to perform. Because the music's tones were similar to those of [[Shan'ge|Shange]] (Sh\u0101n G\u0113,\u5c71\u6b4c) people named this art ''Small Tunes and Songs Troupes'' ([[pinyin]]: Xiao G\u0113 W\u00e9n Sh\u016b B\u0101n, [[simplified Chinese]]:\u5c0f\u6b4c\u6587\u4e66\u73ed). The small in the name referred to its humble folk foundation and contrasted it with \"large\" formal opera from the area.\n\nPerformances were simple. Actors were often peasants who would perform between busy agricultural seasons. They often had no costumes and only a few props, though sometimes rented simple costumes from larger local opera troupes. Musical accompaniment was sparse consisting of only a pair of drums and a wooden clapper played by a performer offstage. This made the performances very mobile allowing the troupes to perform throughout the region. The opera used plain language in the vernacular which made it accessible and popular with local populations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Initial Development===  \nAs ''Small Tunes and Songs Troupes'' expanded in size and popularity, it entered [[Shanghai]] theaters. Due to its unique, elegant and soft singing style compared with other political and spectacular performances, Yue opera found an audience there. It soon changed its name to ''ShaoXing Civil Opera'' ([[pinyin]]: Sh\u00e0o Xing W\u00e9n X\u00ec \u7ecd\u5174\u6587\u620f) in 1916, to better represent its performances as art pieces that reflected regional culture. However, both the singing style and ''banhu'' fiddle (accompaniment) that ShaoXing Civil Opera utilized were under-developed and vulgar compared with other, more delicate operas in Shanghai. It soon lost its prestige and popularity in this big city.\n\nReturning to their roots in Sheng County, ''ShaoXing Civic Opera'' performers like ''Jinshui Wang'' ([[simplified Chinese]]: ''\u738b\u91d1\u6c34'') put great effort into improving their performance and singing style. These artists absorbed the essence of different opera styles including Beijing Opera they had seen in Shanghai. During this process, Four Gong Pitch ([[pinyin]]: S\u00ec G\u014dng Qi\u0101ng, [[simplified Chinese]]: ''\u56db\u5de5\u8154'') became the remarkable fruit of this blending. This music pitch is extraordinary because it resolved the unnatural status women have when they play male roles. ShaoXing Civic Operatic Troupe further developed a systematic training in singing style and sound practice. It utilized [[erhu]] and other linear fiddles as alternative accompaniments to adjust music.\n\n===Women-performed opera===\nWhen Jinshui Wang came back to Sheng County, he had been deeply impressed by the prosperous artistic atmosphere in Shanghai. Having seen different forms of opera during that time and saw the business opportunities in founding an opera performed by women. In February, 1923, he opened an all girls opera class and spent huge amount of money attracting and rewarding young women to join.

It was transformed into the first professional women's troupe at the end of the girl's apprenticeship. In the 1920s, the social status of both women and arts performers (also known as [[Xizi]], \u620f\u5b50) was very humble. Governments assumed that operas performed by women would lower the value of the art. Under great pressure and in a limited business market, the first wave of female artists left the class after six years for marriage.\n\nThe progress these artists achieved was noteworthy.

One of them is economic incentive. In the early 20th century, young Chinese women had only two options to earn their livelihoods. They were either sent to a wealthy family as a [[tongyangxi|child bride]], or to the factories to work. In 1929, the [[Wall Street Crash]] had tremendous global influence. Many factories in Shanghai closed down, and as a result, women often had no option but to attend female-performed opera classes to earn a living. These women usually received three months acting training, and then participated in performances to gain more experience in acting.\n\nAnother explanation was that the performing style of Shaoxing Literal Opera fit with women's nature {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. As young women tend to be more glorious on stage according to Sheng County's newspaper at that time, the tender and gentle features of Shaoxing Literal Art became more outstanding under such highlighting. Furthermore, Four Gong Qiang worked more vividly and delicately under women's performances.\n\n===Evolution===\nOriginating in the folk song and ballad singing of rural areas in Zhejiang, by drawing on the experience of other developed Chinese opera forms such as Peking opera and [[Kunqu]], Yueju opera became popular in Shanghai in early 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Yueju performers in Shanghai launched a movement to reform the Yueju performance which drew influences from, new-style literature (a part of the [[New Culture Movement]]), Western drama and film, making their opera remarkably different from other forms in China. A director-centered system replaced the scene plot system that dictated how a part or scene should be acted.

It was initially an entertainment for people in [[Sheng County]]. Its lyrics are mostly collected from conversations between farmers while they were working. Audiences loved these ballads because of their vivid description of daily life. The [[Second Opium War]] interfered with the local economy of Sheng County, located in the [[Jiangnan]] area, near [[Shanghai]]. Since Sheng County agriculturalists were experiencing difficulty earning their livelihoods, they started to turn this folk art into a second source of income.\n\nOver years, the accumulation of lyrics built up the fundamental source materials for Yue opera, and the folk music gradually developed its own style. Performers also began to integrate simple acting and accompanying instruments into the folk music. It gradually became well known, both in Sheng County and neighboring counties.\n\n===Beginnings===  \nAccording to oral history passed down by Yue Opera practitioners, Yue Opera began in 1906.<ref name=\":1\" /> At the end of the first month of the lunar year [[Zh\u0113ngyu\u00e8]] ([[simplified Chinese]]:\u6b63\u6708) in 1906, artists gathered together in Chen Wanyuan ([[simplified Chinese]]: \u9648\u4e07\u5143)'s house. Although these artists usually only performed in groups of two or three and had never performed together before, Chen and other residents encouraged them to put on a joint production instead of multiple separate retelling of the stories.<ref name=\":1\" /> The first performance was thus generated. The show turned out to be a great success, and residents were delighted and willing to talk about it.\n\nOver time more and more counties invited them to perform. Because the music's tones were similar to those of [[Shange]] (Sh\u0101n G\u0113,\u5c71\u6b4c) people named this art ''Small Tunes and Songs Troupes'' ([[pinyin]]: Xiao G\u0113 W\u00e9n Sh\u016b B\u0101n, [[simplified Chinese]]:\u5c0f\u6b4c\u6587\u4e66\u73ed). The small in the name referred to its humble folk foundation and contrasted it with \"large\" formal opera from the area.\n\nPerformances were simple. Actors were often peasants who would perform between busy agricultural seasons. They often had no costumes and only a few props, though sometimes rented simple costumes from larger local opera troupes. Musical accompaniment was sparse consisting of only a pair of drums and a wooden clapper played by a performer offstage. This made the performances very mobile allowing the troupes to perform throughout the region. The opera used plain language in the vernacular which made it accessible and popular with local populations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Initial Development===  \nAs ''Small Tunes and Songs Troupes'' expanded in size and popularity, it entered [[Shanghai]] theaters. Due to its unique, elegant and soft singing style compared with other political and spectacular performances, Yue opera found an audience there. It soon changed its name to ''ShaoXing Civil Opera'' ([[pinyin]]: Sh\u00e0o Xing W\u00e9n X\u00ec \u7ecd\u5174\u6587\u620f) in 1916, to better represent its performances as art pieces that reflected regional culture. However, both the singing style and ''banhu'' fiddle (accompaniment) that ShaoXing Civil Opera utilized were under-developed and vulgar compared with other, more delicate operas in Shanghai. It soon lost its prestige and popularity in this big city.\n\nReturning to their roots in Sheng County, ''ShaoXing Civic Opera'' performers like ''Jinshui Wang'' ([[simplified Chinese]]: ''\u738b\u91d1\u6c34'') put great effort into improving their performance and singing style. These artists absorbed the essence of different opera styles including Beijing Opera they had seen in Shanghai. During this process, Four Gong Pitch ([[pinyin]]: S\u00ec G\u014dng Qi\u0101ng, [[simplified Chinese]]: ''\u56db\u5de5\u8154'') became the remarkable fruit of this blending. This music pitch is extraordinary because it resolved the unnatural status women have when they play male roles. ShaoXing Civic Operatic Troupe further developed a systematic training in singing style and sound practice. It utilized [[erhu]] and other linear fiddles as alternative accompaniments to adjust music.\n\n===Women-performed opera===\nWhen Jinshui Wang came back to Sheng County, he had been deeply impressed by the prosperous artistic atmosphere in Shanghai. Having seen different forms of opera during that time and saw the business opportunities in founding an opera performed by women. In February, 1923, he opened an all girls opera class and spent huge amount of money attracting and rewarding young women to join. (\"Class\" here is an organization in which members work and study at the same time.)\n\nHowever, the first class existed for only six years. It was transformed into the first professional women's troupe at the end of the girl's apprenticeship. In the 1920s, the social status of both women and arts performers (also known as [[Xizi]], \u620f\u5b50) was very humble. Governments assumed that operas performed by women would lower the value of the art. Under great pressure and in a limited business market, the first wave of female artists left the class after six years for marriage.\n\nThe progress these artists achieved was noteworthy. As the influence of their opera grew, more and more female classes were founded. By the beginning of the 1930s, [[Zhejiang Province]] had about two hundred female classes as well and two thousand students.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gao|first1=Yi long|title=The historical story of Yue Opera \u8d8a\u5267\u53f2\u8bdd|publisher=\u4e0a\u6d77\u6587\u827a\u51fa\u7248\u793e|edition=1}}</ref>\n\n====The rise of Shaoxing Literal Opera in the early 1930s====\nThere are two well-known explanations for the rise of Shaoxing Literal Opera at that time.

When asked where her stepmother was, she recounted Abby receiving a note asking her to visit a sick friend. She also stated that she thought Abby had returned and asked if someone could go upstairs and look for her. Sullivan and a neighbor, Mrs. Churchill, were halfway up the stairs, their eyes level with the floor, when they looked into the guest room and saw Abby lying face down on the floor. Most of the officers who interviewed Borden reported that they disliked her attitude; some said she was too calm and poised. Despite her \"attitude\" and changing alibis, nobody bothered to check her for bloodstains. Police did search her room, but it was a cursory inspection; at the trial they admitted to not doing a proper search because Borden was not feeling well.

Police were stationed around the house on the night of August 4, during which an officer said he had seen Borden enter the cellar with Russell, carrying a kerosene lamp and a slop pail.{{sfn|Douglas|Olshaker|2001|p=106}} He stated he saw both women exit the cellar, after which Borden returned alone; though he was unable to see what she was doing, he stated it appeared she was bent over the sink.{{sfn|Douglas|Olshaker|2001|p=106}}\n\nOn August 5, Morse left the house and was mobbed by hundreds of people; police had to escort him back to the house. On August 6, police conducted a more thorough search of the house, inspecting the sisters' clothing and confiscating the broken-handled hatchet-head. That evening a police officer and the mayor visited the Bordens, and Lizzie was informed that she was a suspect in the murders. The next morning, Russell entered the kitchen to find Borden tearing up a dress. She explained that she was planning to put it on the fire because it was covered in paint. It was never determined whether it was the dress she had been wearing on the day of the murders.<ref name=inv />\n\n=== Inquest ===\nBorden appeared at the inquest hearing on August 8. Her request to have her family attorney present was refused under a state statute providing that an inquest must be held in private. She had been prescribed regular doses of [[morphine]] to calm her nerves, and it is possible that her testimony was affected by this. Her behavior was erratic, and she often refused to answer a question even if the answer would be beneficial to her. She often contradicted herself and provided alternating accounts of the morning in question, such as saying she was in the kitchen reading a magazine when her father arrived home, then saying she was in the dining room doing some ironing, and then saying she was coming down the stairs.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|pages=65\u201367}} She also said she removed her father's boots and put slippers on him, while police photographs clearly showed him wearing his boots.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|p=74}}\n\nThe [[district attorney]] was very aggressive and confrontational.

Following her release from jail, where she was held during the trial, Borden chose to remain a resident of Fall River despite facing ostracism from the other residents. The [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] elected not to charge anyone else with the murder of Andrew and Abby Borden. She spent the remainder of her life in Fall River before dying of [[pneumonia]], aged 66, just days before the death of her sister, Emma.\n\nBorden and her association with the murders has remained a topic in American [[popular culture]] [[mythology]] into the 21st century, and she has been depicted in various films, theatrical productions, literary works, and [[Skipping-rope rhyme|folk rhymes]]. \n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Borden House 92 Second St Fall River Massachusetts 1892.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lizzie Borden House|Borden household]] house|display=title|The [[Lizzie Borden House|Borden household]] at 92 Second Street in Fall River, Massachusetts<br />{{Coord|41.6989|-71.1562}}]]\nLizzie Andrew Borden{{efn| During the 1892 inquest over her father and stepmother's death, Lizzie stated that she had been christened as Lizzie, not Elizabeth.<ref name=\"inquest\">{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/LizzieBorden/bordeninquest.html |title=Inquest Testimony of Lizzie Borden |publisher=[[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]] School of Law |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref>}} was born July 19, 1860,{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2008|p=279}} in Fall River, Massachusetts, to Sarah Anthony [[n\u00e9e]] Morse (1823\u20131863){{sfn|Hoffman|2000|p=41}} and Andrew Jackson Borden (1822\u20131892).{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|p=127}} Through her father, she was of [[English people|English]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|pages=126\u2013127}} Lizzie's father Andrew grew up in very modest surroundings and struggled financially as a young man, despite being the descendant of wealthy and influential local residents.

After their stepmother's sister received a house, the sisters had demanded and received a rental property (the home they had lived in until their mother died) which they purchased from their father for $1; a few weeks before the murders, they sold the property back to their father for $5,000 ({{Inflation|US|5000|1892|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"inquest\" />{{Inflation-fn|US}} The night before the murders, John Vinnicum Morse, the brother of Lizzie's and Emma's deceased mother, visited and was invited to stay for a few days to discuss business matters with Andrew.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Some writers{{Who|date=October 2018}} have speculated that their conversation, particularly about property transfer, may have aggravated an already tense situation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nFor several days before the murders, the entire household had been violently ill.

After breakfast the next morning, at which Andrew, Abby, Lizzie, Morse and the Bordens' maid Bridget \"Maggie\" Sullivan were present, Andrew and Morse went to the sitting room, where they chatted for nearly an hour. Morse left around 8:48&nbsp;am to buy a pair of [[ox]]en and visit his niece in Fall River, planning to return to the Borden home for lunch at noon.{{sfn|Kent|1992|p=23}} Andrew left for his morning walk sometime after 9 am.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAlthough the cleaning of the guest room was one of Lizzie's and Emma's regular chores, Abby went upstairs  some time between 9:00&nbsp;am and 10:30&nbsp;am to make the bed.{{sfn|Porter|2006|p=4}} According to the forensic investigation, Abby was facing her killer at the time of the attack.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=46}} She was first struck on the side of the head with a hatchet which cut her just above the ear, causing her to turn and fall face down on the floor, creating contusions on her nose and forehead.{{sfn|Miller|2016|pages=46\u201347}} Her killer then struck her multiple times, delivering 17 more direct hits to the back of her head, killing her.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=46}}\n\nWhen Andrew returned at around 10:30&nbsp;am, his key failed to open the door, so he knocked for attention. Sullivan went to unlock the door; finding it jammed, she uttered an expletive.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=83}} She would later testify that she heard Lizzie laughing immediately after this; she did not see Lizzie, but stated that the laughter was coming from the top of the stairs.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=83}} This was considered significant as Abby was already dead by this time, and her body would have been visible to anyone on the home's second floor.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=83}} Lizzie later denied being upstairs and testified that her father had asked her where Abby was, and she had replied that a messenger had delivered Abby a summons to visit a sick friend.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=8}} Lizzie stated that she had then removed Andrew's boots and helped him into his slippers before he lay down on the sofa for a nap (an anomaly contradicted by the crime scene photos, which show Andrew wearing boots).{{sfn|Kent|1992|p=58}} She then informed Sullivan of a department store sale and permitted her to go, but Sullivan felt unwell and went to take a nap in her bedroom instead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nSullivan testified that she was in her third-floor room, resting from cleaning windows, when just before 11:10&nbsp;am she heard Lizzie call from downstairs, \"Maggie, come quick!

When asked where her stepmother was, she recounted Abby receiving a note asking her to visit a sick friend. She also stated that she thought Abby had returned and asked if someone could go upstairs and look for her. Sullivan and a neighbor, Mrs. Churchill, were halfway up the stairs, their eyes level with the floor, when they looked into the guest room and saw Abby lying face down on the floor. Most of the officers who interviewed Borden reported that they disliked her attitude; some said she was too calm and poised. Despite her \"attitude\" and changing alibis, nobody bothered to check her for bloodstains. Police did search her room, but it was a cursory inspection; at the trial they admitted to not doing a proper search because Borden was not feeling well. They were subsequently criticized for their lack of diligence.<ref name=inv>{{cite web |title=The Investigation |url=http://www.thelizziebordencollection.com/investigation.php |work=The Lizzie Borden Collection |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201220726/http://www.thelizziebordencollection.com/investigation.php |archivedate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the basement, police found two hatchets, two axes, and a hatchet-head with a broken handle.{{sfn|Miller|2016|p=66}} The hatchet-head was suspected of being the murder weapon as the break in the handle appeared fresh and the ash and dust on the head, unlike that on the other bladed tools, appeared to have been deliberately applied to make it look as if it had been in the basement for some time.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|p=240}}{{sfn|Miller|2016|pages=66\u201367}} However, none of these tools were removed from the house.<ref name=inv /> Because of the mysterious illness that had stricken the household before the murders, the family's milk and Andrew's and Abby's stomachs (removed during autopsies performed in the Borden dining room) were tested for poison;{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=29}} none was found.{{sfn|Miller|2012|p=146}}\n\nLizzie and Emma's friend, Alice Russell, decided to stay with them the night following the murders while Morse spent the night in the attic guest room (contrary to later accounts that he slept in the murder-site guest room). Police were stationed around the house on the night of August 4, during which an officer said he had seen Borden enter the cellar with Russell, carrying a kerosene lamp and a slop pail.{{sfn|Douglas|Olshaker|2001|p=106}} He stated he saw both women exit the cellar, after which Borden returned alone; though he was unable to see what she was doing, he stated it appeared she was bent over the sink.{{sfn|Douglas|Olshaker|2001|p=106}}\n\nOn August 5, Morse left the house and was mobbed by hundreds of people; police had to escort him back to the house. On August 6, police conducted a more thorough search of the house, inspecting the sisters' clothing and confiscating the broken-handled hatchet-head. That evening a police officer and the mayor visited the Bordens, and Lizzie was informed that she was a suspect in the murders. The next morning, Russell entered the kitchen to find Borden tearing up a dress. She explained that she was planning to put it on the fire because it was covered in paint. It was never determined whether it was the dress she had been wearing on the day of the murders.<ref name=inv />\n\n=== Inquest ===\nBorden appeared at the inquest hearing on August 8. Her request to have her family attorney present was refused under a state statute providing that an inquest must be held in private. She had been prescribed regular doses of [[morphine]] to calm her nerves, and it is possible that her testimony was affected by this. Her behavior was erratic, and she often refused to answer a question even if the answer would be beneficial to her. She often contradicted herself and provided alternating accounts of the morning in question, such as saying she was in the kitchen reading a magazine when her father arrived home, then saying she was in the dining room doing some ironing, and then saying she was coming down the stairs.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|pages=65\u201367}} She also said she removed her father's boots and put slippers on him, while police photographs clearly showed him wearing his boots.{{sfn|Kent|Flynn|1992|p=74}}\n\nThe [[district attorney]] was very aggressive and confrontational. On August 11, Borden was served with a warrant of arrest and jailed.

It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]]. A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]). The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their appearance.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]]. However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]]. Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is indignant.\n\nAmid Komajuro's personal dramas, the troupe's old-fashioned [[kabuki]]-style performances fail to attract the town's residents. The other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. As audiences decline, problems pile up: the manager of the troupe abandons them, and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees.\n\nWhen Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to accompany him, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]].

It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]]. A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]). The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their appearance.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]]. However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]]. Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is indignant.\n\nAmid Komajuro's personal dramas, the troupe's old-fashioned [[kabuki]]-style performances fail to attract the town's residents. The other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. As audiences decline, problems pile up: the manager of the troupe abandons them, and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees.\n\nWhen Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to accompany him, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]]. The last scene of the film shows Komajuro, tended by Sumiko, in a train heading for Kuwana.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] - Komajuro (troupe leader)\n*[[Machiko Ky\u014d]] - Sumiko (his mistress)\n*[[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (actor)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]] - Kiyoshi (his son)\n*[[Haruko Sugimura]] - Oyoshi (Kiyoshi's mother)\n*[[Ayako Wakao]] - Kayo (younger actress)\n*[[Hitomi Nozoe]] - Aiko\n*[[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] - Theatre owner\n*[[K\u014dji Mitsui]] - Kichinosuke\n*[[Haruo Tanaka]] - Yatazo\n*[[Yosuke Irie]] - Sugiyama\n*[[Hikaru Hoshi]] - Kimura\n*[[Mantar\u014d Ushio]] - Sentaro\n*[[Kumeko Urabe]] - Shige\n*[[Tatsuo Hanabu]] - Rokuzaburo\n*[[Tadashi Date]] - Sensh\u014d \n*[[Masahiko Shimazu]] - Masao (Sensh\u014d's grandson)\n*[[Toyoko Takahashi]] - Aiko no haha\n*[[Mutsuko Sakura]] - O-Katsu\n*[[Natsuko Kahara]] - Yae\n*[[Ts\u00fbsai Sugawara]] - Buyer at bankruptcy\n\n==Production==\n\n''Floating Weeds'', Ozu's only film for [[Daiei Film|Daiei]], was produced at the studio's urging after he completed ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'', which had fulfilled the director's contractual obligation to complete one film per year for [[Shochiku]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Donald|last=Richie|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/320-stories-of-floating-weeds|title=Stories of ''Floating Weeds''|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|date=April 19, 2004|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Ozu first planned to remake ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' for Shochiku, and the title was intended to be ''A Ham Actor'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u6839\u5f79\u8005}} ''{{transl|ja|daikon yakusha}}'', \"radish actor\"); the stars (most of whom were attached to Shochiku) were to include [[Eitar\u014d Shind\u014d]] and [[Chikage Awashima]] as the primary leads, [[Masami Taura]] and [[Ineko Arima]] as the youth leads, and [[Isuzu Yamada]] as the former mistress.
