Its [[Cannabis in Denmark|cannabis]] trade was tolerated by authorities until 2004. Since then, relations between Christiania and Danish authorities have been strained.

The ramparts and the borough of [[Christianshavn]] (then a separate city) were established in 1617 by King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and [[Amager]]. After the [[siege of Copenhagen]] during the [[Second Northern War]], the ramparts were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] to form a complete defense ring. The western ramparts of Copenhagen were demolished during the 19th century, but those of Christianshavn were allowed to remain. They are today considered among the finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |title=History of the Christiania area |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}, [[Heritage Agency of Denmark]], 12 March 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nThe barracks of B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de (''B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6des Kaserne'') housed the [[Kongens Artilleriregiment|Royal Artillery Regiment]], the [[Army Materiel Command (Denmark)|Army Materiel Command]] and ammunition laboratories and depots. Less used after World War II, the barracks were abandoned between 1967 and 1971.\n\nThe adjacent area to the north, [[Holmen Naval Base|Holmen]], was Denmark's main naval base until the 1990s. It is an area in development, home to the new [[Copenhagen Opera House]] (not to be confused with the first and still existing venue called \"Operaen\", a concert venue in Christiania) and schools. An area further north is still used by the [[navy]], but open to the public during daytime.\n\nThe outermost defence line, Enveloppen, has been renamed ''Dyssen'' in Christiania language (except for the southernmost tip of it which was not annexed by Christiania). It is connected to central Christiania by a bridge across the main moat or can be reached by the path beginning at Christmas M\u00f8llers Plads. Four gunpowder storehouses line the [[redan]]s. They were built 1779-80 to replace a storage in central Copenhagen, at [[\u00d8sterport]], which exploded infamously in 1770, killing 50 people. The buildings are renamed ''Aircondition'', ''Autogena'', ''Fakirskolen'' (The Fakir School) and ''Kosmiske Blomst'' (Cosmic Flower) and have, although protected, been slightly altered from their historical state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |title=History of Christiania area |accessdate=2010-01-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001193758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}, Heritage Agency of Denmark {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n[[File:Christiania depuis Notre Sauveur.jpg|thumb]]\nThe last Danish [[execution]] site, active from 1946 to 1950, can still be seen on the Second [[Redan]] close to the building called ''Aircondition''.<ref>[http://www.information.dk/19110 ''Skydeskuret p\u00e5 Amager''] (The shooting shed on Amager), [[Dagbladet Information|Information]], 29 May 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref> The wooden execution shed is gone, but the concrete foundation and a drain for the blood remain just next to the path.

On 4 September 1971, inhabitants of the surrounding neighborhood broke down the fence to take over parts of the unused area as a playground for their children.\n\nAlthough the takeover was not necessarily organized in the beginning, some claim this happened as a protest against the Danish government. At the time there was a lack of affordable housing in Copenhagen.\n\nOn 26 September 1971, Christiania was declared open by [[Jacob Ludvigsen]], a well-known [[provo (movement)|provo]] and journalist who published a magazine called ''Hovedbladet'' ('The main paper'), which was intended for and successfully distributed to mostly young people. In the paper, Ludvigsen wrote an article in which he and five others explored what he termed 'The Forbidden City of the Military'. The article widely announced the proclamation of the free town, and among other things he wrote the following under the headline ''Civilians conquered the 'forbidden city' of the military'':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |title=Christiania |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230234028/http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}, facsimiles of 'Hovedbladet', Jacob Ludvigsen's website {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Christiania is the land of the settlers. It is the biggest opportunity so far to build up a society from scratch - while nevertheless still incorporating the remaining constructions. Own electricity plant, a bath-house, a giant athletics building, where all the seekers of peace could have their grand meditation - and yoga center. Halls where theater groups can feel at home. Buildings for the stoners who are too paranoid and weak to participate in the race ... Yes for those who feel the beating of the pioneer heart there can be no doubt as to the purpose of Christiania. It is the part of the city which has been kept secret to us - but no more.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</blockquote>\n\nLudvigsen was co-author of Christiania's [[mission statement]], dating from 1971, which offers the following:\n\n<blockquote>The objective of Christiania is to create a self-governing society whereby each and every individual holds themselves responsible over the wellbeing of the entire community. Our society is to be economically self-sustaining and, as such, our aspiration is to be steadfast in our conviction that psychological and physical destitution can be averted.</blockquote>\n\nThe spirit of Christiania quickly developed into one of the [[hippie]] movement, the [[squatter]] movement, [[collectivism]] and [[anarchism]] in contrast to the site's previous military use.\n\nThe 1976 protest song ''I kan ikke sl\u00e5 os ihjel'' (translated: \"You cannot kill us\"), written by Tom Lunden of [[flower power]] rock group [[Bifrost (band)|Bifrost]], became the unofficial anthem of Christiania.<ref>Henrik Vesterberg, {{cite web |url=http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |title=Sangene kan de i hvert fald ikke sl\u00e5 ihjel |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218152618/http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |archivedate=February 18, 2012 }}, ''Politiken'', July 11, 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n=== The community ===\n[[File:Dyssebroen, Christiania 2015 01.jpg|thumb|The \"[[Dyssebroen]]\" bridge, connecting Christiania's main portion ([[Christianshavn|Christianshavn Sid]]e) to its more 'rural' [[Amager|Amager Side]] backdrop across [[Stadsgraven]] canal]]\n[[Meditation]] and [[yoga]] have always been popular among the Christianites, and for many years Christiania had a theatrical group Solvognen, who, beyond their theatre performances, also staged many happenings in Copenhagen and throughout Denmark. Ludvigsen had always talked of the acceptance of drug-addicts who could no longer cope with regular society, and the spirit of that belief has still not diminished, even though many problems sprouted due to drug traffic and use (mostly of 'hard drugs', however, which are not tolerated in Christiania). These addicts enter and remain in Christiania and are considered just as integral to the Freetown ethics as the entrepreneurs. For this reason many Danes have seen Christiania as a successful social experiment. However, for years the legal status of the region has been in a limbo due to different Danish governments attempting to remove the Christianites. Such attempts at removal have all been unsuccessful so far.\n\nChristiania is considered to be the fourth largest [[tourist attraction]] in Copenhagen (and it has half a million visitors annually);<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/12/25/tema/reise/ferie/europaferie/europa/30909554/ En rusten plattform og et kuleformet hus mener de er egne stater - Disse ni europeiske landene eksisterer egentlig ikke.]</ref> and abroad it is a well-known \"brand\" for the supposedly progressive and liberated Danish lifestyle. Many Danish businesses and organizations also use Christiania as a show place for their foreign friends and guests.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The purpose is to show something Danish that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe people in Christiania have developed their own set of rules, independent of the Danish government. The rules forbid stealing, violence, guns, knives, bulletproof vests, hard drugs and [[Colors (motorcycling)|bikers' colors]].<ref>[https://milepoint.com/forums/threads/guide-to-the-alternative-copenhagen.2246/ Guide to The Alternative Copenhagen]</ref>{{self-published source|date=July 2015}}\n\nFamous for its main drag, known as ''Pusher Street'', where [[hashish|hash]] and [[Skunk (cannabis)|skunk weed]] is sold openly from permanent stands, it nevertheless does have rules forbidding 'hard drugs', such as [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[heroin]]. The hash commerce is controversial, but since the rules require a consensus they cannot be removed unless everybody agrees. Legalization of cannabis is one of the ideas of many of the citizens in Christiania. The region negotiated an arrangement with the Danish defense ministry (which still owns the land) in 1995. Since 1994, residents have paid taxes and fees for water, electricity, trash disposal, etc.\n\nAfter bitter negotiations that temporarily resulted in the area being sealed off to the public, in June 2011, the residents of Christiania agreed to collectively set up a fund to formally purchase the land at below market prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |title=UPDATE: Christiania accepts \"beautiful agreement\" |accessdate=2011-07-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130035107/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |archivedate=November 30, 2011 }}</ref> The community made its first payment in July 2012, officially becoming legal landowners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-copenhagens-christiania-neighborhood-the-future-looks-more-settled/2012/09/06/cb1df946-ed38-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html |work=The Washington Post |title=In Copenhagen's Christiania neighborhood, the future looks more settled|author=Vickers, Steve|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Gay House ===\nSince the 1970s, the Gay House (B\u00f8ssehuset), one of Christiania's autonomous institutions, had been a center for gay activism, parties, and theatre. The humorous and artistically high-ranking variety-style shows still have fame among Copenhagen homosexuals. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn 2002, a group of young gay performers and activists, [[Dunst (queer network in Copenhagen)|Dunst]], were invited to take over the house so it could remain a center for gay activity. Dunst introduced democratic management and established open workshops for photography, art, music, dance, video etc. They also arranged three 'Save Christiania' nights, a cabaret show and three support parties in order to be able to pay down some of the Gay House's debt to Christiania. According to Dunst, however, neighbours would never readily accept them and the newcomers were accused of not understanding \"the Christiania lifestyle\". Dunst claimed they received verbal abuse, threatening letters, and even in one instance, had a baseball bat brandished against them. Some disliked Dunst's loud parties and their contemporary electro-punk style music being described as [[techno]]. After nine months, they were asked to leave Christiania.\n\nIn 2004, Dunst participated in 'Christiania Distortion', an event supportive of Christiania. As they could not make use of the Gay House, Dunst's part of the event took place in a bus circling around Christiania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/about_us/dk_hvad_er_dunst.html |title=Dunst historie |publisher=Dunst.dk |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/press/2004/04_05_26_ugespeglet/ugespeglet.html |title=\u00c5bent brev til Christiania |publisher=Dunst.dk |date=26 May 2004 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005 shooting and murder ===\nOn 24 April 2005, a 26-year-old Christiania resident was killed and three other residents injured in a violent gang assault on ''Pusher Street''. The reason for this was a feud over the cannabis market of Copenhagen.\n\nAfter the open cannabis trade was ended in Christiania the year before, criminal circles outside Christiania were eager to take over the market. Those responsible for the shooting were one such gang residing in [[N\u00f8rrebro]], a northwestern borough of the city. They had repeatedly asked the Christiania pushers to allow them on their market and had repeatedly been turned down. On 23 April 2005, this stalemate escalated violently. The pushers of Christiania discovered that a member of the outside gang had infiltrated their organisation by dating a female pusher. He was exposed and just barely escaped; two shots were fired at him. The next day two cars pulled up outside Christiania and 6\u20138 masked men with [[automatic weapon]]s got out and headed for ''Pusher Street''.

The residents built roadblocks, but the police eventually entered the Freetown en masse and were met by resistance. Residents threw stones and shot fireworks at police vehicles.

A downside to this was that it moved the problem to another part of Christiania further up the road where the residents now have blocked this entrance entirely until another road block robot will be installed.

A 'no photo sign' remains.]]\nSince its opening, Christiania has been famous for its open cannabis trade, taking place in the centrally located ''Pusher Street'', although named ''Green Light District'' by the Christianian council. Although the hash trade is illegal, authorities were for many years reluctant to forcibly stop it. Proponents thought that concentrating the hash trade at one place would limit its dispersion in society, and that it could prevent users from switching to 'harder drugs'. Some wanted to legalize hash altogether. Opponents thought the ban should be enforced, in Christiania as elsewhere, and that there should be no differentiation between 'soft' and 'hard' drugs. It has also been claimed that the open cannabis trade was one of Copenhagen's major tourist attractions, while some said it scared other potential tourists away. Even though the police have attempted to stop the drug trade, the cannabis market has generally thrived in Christiania. Following the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]] where local residents removed the ''Pusher Street'' stalls, it was estimated that the cannabis sale dropped by about 75%.<ref name=\"pol30oct\"/>\n\n=== Eviction of 'hard drugs' ===\n[[File:Mural in Christiania against hard drugs.jpg|thumb|right|Murals and signs around Christiania make the community's opposition to heroin clear.]]\nDuring the late 1970s 'hard drugs' such as [[heroin]] were considered permissible, but this had grave consequences. In one year, from 1978 to 1979, ten people had died in Christiania from drug overdose; four of them were residents. Most of them lived in a building called 'The Arc of Peace', which was in an extreme level of disrepair: doors were missing, there were holes in the floors and, in most rooms, there was no furniture except for mattresses. One floor was overrun by a feral cat colony.\n\nHeroin-pushers were eventually evicted by the residents, and the \"ban\" on hard drugs continues to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christiania.org/info/christiania-guide/|title=Christiania.org -   Christiania Guide|website=www.christiania.org|language=da-DK|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Biker gang eviction ===\nAround 1984 a Copenhagen-resident biker gang called Bullshit arrived in Christiania and took control of a part of the cannabis market. Violence in the neighborhood increased and many Christianites felt unsafe and unhappy with the new residents. This resulted in sabotage acts directed towards the bikers as well as the publication of several provocative manuscripts urging the Christianites to throw out the powerful and armed bikers. This tension culminated when the police found a murdered individual who had been sliced to pieces and buried beneath the floor of a building. Christiania reacted with two colossal community meetings\u2014one outside the building\u2014where it was agreed that the bikers had to leave.\n\nA biker war between the Hells Angels and rival gangs over the drug trade continued in Copenhagen until 1996 from the murder of the leader of Bullshit, 'Makrellen', who controlled the cannabis trade in Christiania.\n\n=== Action against open drug selling ===\nSince its opening in 1971, the open drug trade of Christiania was a thorn in the side of Danish authorities, a constant source of public discussion, and led to protests from neighboring countries as well (especially [[Drug policy of Sweden|Sweden with its no-tolerance drug policy]]). When the centre-right [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] took office in 2001, one of its promises was to end illegal activities at Christiania. These were, including the obvious cannabis market, a long list of alleged criminal activities. People demanded the end of 'hard drugs' sales, such as cocaine and amphetamines, weapons trade, dealing with contraband etc. The Christiania residents claimed them to be purely speculative accusations.\n\nIn 2002, the government began aiming to make the cannabis trade less visible. In response, the cannabis sellers covered their stands in military [[camouflage]] nets as a humorous reply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&side=10 |title=Christiania Guide - Page 10 - www.christiania.org |accessdate=2007-06-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193855/http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&side=10 |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}</ref> On 4 January 2004, the stands were demolished by the cannabis dealers the day before a large scale police operation. They knew about this operation, and decided to take the stands down themselves. The police made more than 20 arrests in the following weeks, and a large part of the organized dealer network of ''Pusher Street'' was then eliminated. Before they were demolished, the [[National Museum of Denmark]] was able to get one of the more colorful stands, which is now part of an exhibit.\n\nOn 16 March 2004, police raided the area. Allegedly, many dealers started to move huge amounts of cannabis out into Copenhagen and the rest of the country instead. This was done in order to avoid the heavy police-presence in Christiania and to meet the demand for cannabis by clients.\n\nThe open cannabis trade returned to ''Pusher Street'' after the 2004 raids, but the stalls were again torn down by Christiania's residents after the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]].<ref name=\"BBC-2016-09-02\"/> The hiatus on the open cannabis trade was short-lived; by May 2017, the stalls on Pusher Street were restored.\n\n== Further developments ==\nThe open cannabis trade in Christiania has been hailed by some [[Danes]] and condemned by others. The [[Centre-right politics|center-right]] government took a number of steps to enforce the law in Christiania. The first step in this process was a police crackdown on the cannabis trade. Both politicians and police declared that the cannabis trade would not be allowed to return. The second (and currently ongoing) phase is the registration of all buildings in Christiania. The third step will be the demolition of a number of wooden private residences situated in a nature conservation area (the historic naval fortress of Copenhagen). These buildings had all been approved by the authorities before the new government passed the current law on Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  For the last 15 years the government has not allowed construction in Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} This is now being enforced on a zero-tolerance policy with the help of a massive police presence.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Governmental normalization measures ===\nIn 2004, the Danish government passed a law abolishing the collective and treating its 900 members as individuals. Beginning in the summer of 2005, a series of protests were staged by Christiania members. During the same time, Danish police made frequent sweeps of the area.\n\nThe Christiania Caf\u00e9 ''M\u00e5nefiskeren'' set up a board recording the number of police patrols on Christiania in November 2005. In the summer of 2006 this passed the 1,000th patrol (about 4\u20136 patrols a day). These patrols normally consisted of 6 to 20 police officers, often dressed in combat uniform and sometimes with police dogs.\n\nIn January 2006, the government proposed that Christiania would be turned into a mixed alternative community and residential area adding [[condominium]]s for 400 new residents. Current residents, now paying [[Danish krone|DKK]] 1,450 (USD 250) per month, would be allowed to remain but need to begin paying normal rent for the facilities, albeit below market rent levels. Christiania has rejected this scenario, fearing the freetown would turn into a normal Copenhagen neighborhood. In particular, the concept of privately owned dwellings is claimed to be incompatible with Christiania's collective ownership.\n\nIn September 2007, the representatives of Christiania and Copenhagen's city council reached an agreement to cede control of Christiania to the city over the course of 10 years for the purposes of business development.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/18/farewelltofreetown | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Farewell to Freetown | date=2007-09-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Harriet | last=Riley}}</ref>  Also, as of May 2009, the [[Courts of Denmark|Eastern High Court]] upheld a 2004 Act of Parliament which reaffirmed the state's legal claim to control of the base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |title=Christiania loses court challenge |accessdate=2010-01-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811224214/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}</ref> This rule is confirmed in February 2011 by the Supreme Court. The state has now full right of disposal of the Christiania area.

In July 2012, they made the first payment, and the Christianites went from squatters to legal landowners. A foundation, run by residents, was set up to raise funds and apply for a bank loan. Christianites were able to buy about 19 acres of the initial 84-acre plot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-copenhagens-christiania-neighborhood-the-future-looks-more-settled/2012/09/06/cb1df946-ed38-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html|title=In Copenhagen\u2019s Christiania neighborhood, the future looks more settled|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>\n\nIn his January 2013 book ''In the Name of the People'', [[Ivo Mosley]] cited Christiania as one of the few examples of communities run on truly democratic lines that exist in the world. Six months later, the laws governing Christiania changed. On July 2013, the legislative proposal L 179 for the repealing of the Christiania Law is adopted by all parties in the Danish Parliament with the exception of the Danish People's Party. From this moment, the same legislative rules that apply for the rest of Denmark apply to Christiania.<ref name=\"bygst.dk\"/>\n\n=== Quotes from politicians ===\n{{quote|Christiania is a dwelling for people who wish to live in a different manner ...

The ramparts and the borough of [[Christianshavn]] (then a separate city) were established in 1617 by King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and [[Amager]]. After the [[siege of Copenhagen]] during the [[Second Northern War]], the ramparts were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] to form a complete defense ring. The western ramparts of Copenhagen were demolished during the 19th century, but those of Christianshavn were allowed to remain. They are today considered among the finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |title=History of the Christiania area |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}, [[Heritage Agency of Denmark]], 12 March 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nThe barracks of B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de (''B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6des Kaserne'') housed the [[Kongens Artilleriregiment|Royal Artillery Regiment]], the [[Army Materiel Command (Denmark)|Army Materiel Command]] and ammunition laboratories and depots. Less used after World War II, the barracks were abandoned between 1967 and 1971.\n\nThe adjacent area to the north, [[Holmen Naval Base|Holmen]], was Denmark's main naval base until the 1990s. It is an area in development, home to the new [[Copenhagen Opera House]] (not to be confused with the first and still existing venue called \"Operaen\", a concert venue in Christiania) and schools. An area further north is still used by the [[navy]], but open to the public during daytime.\n\nThe outermost defence line, Enveloppen, has been renamed ''Dyssen'' in Christiania language (except for the southernmost tip of it which was not annexed by Christiania). It is connected to central Christiania by a bridge across the main moat or can be reached by the path beginning at Christmas M\u00f8llers Plads. Four gunpowder storehouses line the [[redan]]s. They were built 1779-80 to replace a storage in central Copenhagen, at [[\u00d8sterport]], which exploded infamously in 1770, killing 50 people. The buildings are renamed ''Aircondition'', ''Autogena'', ''Fakirskolen'' (The Fakir School) and ''Kosmiske Blomst'' (Cosmic Flower) and have, although protected, been slightly altered from their historical state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |title=History of Christiania area |accessdate=2010-01-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001193758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}, Heritage Agency of Denmark {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n[[File:Christiania depuis Notre Sauveur.jpg|thumb]]\nThe last Danish [[execution]] site, active from 1946 to 1950, can still be seen on the Second [[Redan]] close to the building called ''Aircondition''.<ref>[http://www.information.dk/19110 ''Skydeskuret p\u00e5 Amager''] (The shooting shed on Amager), [[Dagbladet Information|Information]], 29 May 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref> The wooden execution shed is gone, but the concrete foundation and a drain for the blood remain just next to the path.

At the time there was a lack of affordable housing in Copenhagen.\n\nOn 26 September 1971, Christiania was declared open by [[Jacob Ludvigsen]], a well-known [[provo (movement)|provo]] and journalist who published a magazine called ''Hovedbladet'' ('The main paper'), which was intended for and successfully distributed to mostly young people. In the paper, Ludvigsen wrote an article in which he and five others explored what he termed 'The Forbidden City of the Military'. The article widely announced the proclamation of the free town, and among other things he wrote the following under the headline ''Civilians conquered the 'forbidden city' of the military'':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |title=Christiania |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230234028/http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}, facsimiles of 'Hovedbladet', Jacob Ludvigsen's website {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Christiania is the land of the settlers. It is the biggest opportunity so far to build up a society from scratch - while nevertheless still incorporating the remaining constructions. Own electricity plant, a bath-house, a giant athletics building, where all the seekers of peace could have their grand meditation - and yoga center. Halls where theater groups can feel at home. Buildings for the stoners who are too paranoid and weak to participate in the race ... Yes for those who feel the beating of the pioneer heart there can be no doubt as to the purpose of Christiania. It is the part of the city which has been kept secret to us - but no more.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</blockquote>\n\nLudvigsen was co-author of Christiania's [[mission statement]], dating from 1971, which offers the following:\n\n<blockquote>The objective of Christiania is to create a self-governing society whereby each and every individual holds themselves responsible over the wellbeing of the entire community. Our society is to be economically self-sustaining and, as such, our aspiration is to be steadfast in our conviction that psychological and physical destitution can be averted.</blockquote>\n\nThe spirit of Christiania quickly developed into one of the [[hippie]] movement, the [[squatter]] movement, [[collectivism]] and [[anarchism]] in contrast to the site's previous military use.\n\nThe 1976 protest song ''I kan ikke sl\u00e5 os ihjel'' (translated: \"You cannot kill us\"), written by Tom Lunden of [[flower power]] rock group [[Bifrost (band)|Bifrost]], became the unofficial anthem of Christiania.<ref>Henrik Vesterberg, {{cite web |url=http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |title=Sangene kan de i hvert fald ikke sl\u00e5 ihjel |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218152618/http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |archivedate=February 18, 2012 }}, ''Politiken'', July 11, 2007 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n=== The community ===\n[[File:Dyssebroen, Christiania 2015 01.jpg|thumb|The \"[[Dyssebroen]]\" bridge, connecting Christiania's main portion ([[Christianshavn|Christianshavn Sid]]e) to its more 'rural' [[Amager|Amager Side]] backdrop across [[Stadsgraven]] canal]]\n[[Meditation]] and [[yoga]] have always been popular among the Christianites, and for many years Christiania had a theatrical group Solvognen, who, beyond their theatre performances, also staged many happenings in Copenhagen and throughout Denmark. Ludvigsen had always talked of the acceptance of drug-addicts who could no longer cope with regular society, and the spirit of that belief has still not diminished, even though many problems sprouted due to drug traffic and use (mostly of 'hard drugs', however, which are not tolerated in Christiania). These addicts enter and remain in Christiania and are considered just as integral to the Freetown ethics as the entrepreneurs. For this reason many Danes have seen Christiania as a successful social experiment. However, for years the legal status of the region has been in a limbo due to different Danish governments attempting to remove the Christianites. Such attempts at removal have all been unsuccessful so far.\n\nChristiania is considered to be the fourth largest [[tourist attraction]] in Copenhagen (and it has half a million visitors annually);<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/12/25/tema/reise/ferie/europaferie/europa/30909554/ En rusten plattform og et kuleformet hus mener de er egne stater - Disse ni europeiske landene eksisterer egentlig ikke.]</ref> and abroad it is a well-known \"brand\" for the supposedly progressive and liberated Danish lifestyle.

The hash commerce is controversial, but since the rules require a consensus they cannot be removed unless everybody agrees. Legalization of cannabis is one of the ideas of many of the citizens in Christiania. The region negotiated an arrangement with the Danish defense ministry (which still owns the land) in 1995. Since 1994, residents have paid taxes and fees for water, electricity, trash disposal, etc.\n\nAfter bitter negotiations that temporarily resulted in the area being sealed off to the public, in June 2011, the residents of Christiania agreed to collectively set up a fund to formally purchase the land at below market prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |title=UPDATE: Christiania accepts \"beautiful agreement\" |accessdate=2011-07-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130035107/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |archivedate=November 30, 2011 }}</ref> The community made its first payment in July 2012, officially becoming legal landowners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-copenhagens-christiania-neighborhood-the-future-looks-more-settled/2012/09/06/cb1df946-ed38-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html |work=The Washington Post |title=In Copenhagen's Christiania neighborhood, the future looks more settled|author=Vickers, Steve|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Gay House ===\nSince the 1970s, the Gay House (B\u00f8ssehuset), one of Christiania's autonomous institutions, had been a center for gay activism, parties, and theatre.

According to Dunst, however, neighbours would never readily accept them and the newcomers were accused of not understanding \"the Christiania lifestyle\". Dunst claimed they received verbal abuse, threatening letters, and even in one instance, had a baseball bat brandished against them. Some disliked Dunst's loud parties and their contemporary electro-punk style music being described as [[techno]]. After nine months, they were asked to leave Christiania.\n\nIn 2004, Dunst participated in 'Christiania Distortion', an event supportive of Christiania. As they could not make use of the Gay House, Dunst's part of the event took place in a bus circling around Christiania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/about_us/dk_hvad_er_dunst.html |title=Dunst historie |publisher=Dunst.dk |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/press/2004/04_05_26_ugespeglet/ugespeglet.html |title=\u00c5bent brev til Christiania |publisher=Dunst.dk |date=26 May 2004 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005 shooting and murder ===\nOn 24 April 2005, a 26-year-old Christiania resident was killed and three other residents injured in a violent gang assault on ''Pusher Street''. The reason for this was a feud over the cannabis market of Copenhagen.\n\nAfter the open cannabis trade was ended in Christiania the year before, criminal circles outside Christiania were eager to take over the market. Those responsible for the shooting were one such gang residing in [[N\u00f8rrebro]], a northwestern borough of the city. They had repeatedly asked the Christiania pushers to allow them on their market and had repeatedly been turned down. On 23 April 2005, this stalemate escalated violently. The pushers of Christiania discovered that a member of the outside gang had infiltrated their organisation by dating a female pusher. He was exposed and just barely escaped; two shots were fired at him. The next day two cars pulled up outside Christiania and 6\u20138 masked men with [[automatic weapon]]s got out and headed for ''Pusher Street''. When they arrived they fired at least 35 rounds indiscriminately toward the crowd, killing one Christianite and injuring three others.\n\nSome saw this tragic incident as a sign that the future survival of the community was dubious due to the risk of violence stemming from the cannabis market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87615.html |title=First arrest in drug war slaying |accessdate=2006-08-18 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182157/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87615.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> Others blamed the incident on the fragmentation of the Copenhagen cannabis market and its expansion to the rest of the city, brought about by the measures of the [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] government.

The residents built roadblocks, but the police eventually entered the Freetown en masse and were met by resistance. Residents threw stones and shot fireworks at police vehicles.

A downside to this was that it moved the problem to another part of Christiania further up the road where the residents now have blocked this entrance entirely until another road block robot will be installed.

A 'no photo sign' remains.]]\nSince its opening, Christiania has been famous for its open cannabis trade, taking place in the centrally located ''Pusher Street'', although named ''Green Light District'' by the Christianian council. Although the hash trade is illegal, authorities were for many years reluctant to forcibly stop it. Proponents thought that concentrating the hash trade at one place would limit its dispersion in society, and that it could prevent users from switching to 'harder drugs'. Some wanted to legalize hash altogether. Opponents thought the ban should be enforced, in Christiania as elsewhere, and that there should be no differentiation between 'soft' and 'hard' drugs. It has also been claimed that the open cannabis trade was one of Copenhagen's major tourist attractions, while some said it scared other potential tourists away. Even though the police have attempted to stop the drug trade, the cannabis market has generally thrived in Christiania. Following the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]] where local residents removed the ''Pusher Street'' stalls, it was estimated that the cannabis sale dropped by about 75%.<ref name=\"pol30oct\"/>\n\n=== Eviction of 'hard drugs' ===\n[[File:Mural in Christiania against hard drugs.jpg|thumb|right|Murals and signs around Christiania make the community's opposition to heroin clear.]]\nDuring the late 1970s 'hard drugs' such as [[heroin]] were considered permissible, but this had grave consequences. In one year, from 1978 to 1979, ten people had died in Christiania from drug overdose; four of them were residents. Most of them lived in a building called 'The Arc of Peace', which was in an extreme level of disrepair: doors were missing, there were holes in the floors and, in most rooms, there was no furniture except for mattresses. One floor was overrun by a feral cat colony.\n\nHeroin-pushers were eventually evicted by the residents, and the \"ban\" on hard drugs continues to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christiania.org/info/christiania-guide/|title=Christiania.org -   Christiania Guide|website=www.christiania.org|language=da-DK|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Biker gang eviction ===\nAround 1984 a Copenhagen-resident biker gang called Bullshit arrived in Christiania and took control of a part of the cannabis market. Violence in the neighborhood increased and many Christianites felt unsafe and unhappy with the new residents. This resulted in sabotage acts directed towards the bikers as well as the publication of several provocative manuscripts urging the Christianites to throw out the powerful and armed bikers. This tension culminated when the police found a murdered individual who had been sliced to pieces and buried beneath the floor of a building. Christiania reacted with two colossal community meetings\u2014one outside the building\u2014where it was agreed that the bikers had to leave.\n\nA biker war between the Hells Angels and rival gangs over the drug trade continued in Copenhagen until 1996 from the murder of the leader of Bullshit, 'Makrellen', who controlled the cannabis trade in Christiania.\n\n=== Action against open drug selling ===\nSince its opening in 1971, the open drug trade of Christiania was a thorn in the side of Danish authorities, a constant source of public discussion, and led to protests from neighboring countries as well (especially [[Drug policy of Sweden|Sweden with its no-tolerance drug policy]]). When the centre-right [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] took office in 2001, one of its promises was to end illegal activities at Christiania. These were, including the obvious cannabis market, a long list of alleged criminal activities. People demanded the end of 'hard drugs' sales, such as cocaine and amphetamines, weapons trade, dealing with contraband etc. The Christiania residents claimed them to be purely speculative accusations.\n\nIn 2002, the government began aiming to make the cannabis trade less visible. In response, the cannabis sellers covered their stands in military [[camouflage]] nets as a humorous reply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&side=10 |title=Christiania Guide - Page 10 - www.christiania.org |accessdate=2007-06-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193855/http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&side=10 |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}</ref> On 4 January 2004, the stands were demolished by the cannabis dealers the day before a large scale police operation. They knew about this operation, and decided to take the stands down themselves. The police made more than 20 arrests in the following weeks, and a large part of the organized dealer network of ''Pusher Street'' was then eliminated. Before they were demolished, the [[National Museum of Denmark]] was able to get one of the more colorful stands, which is now part of an exhibit.\n\nOn 16 March 2004, police raided the area. Allegedly, many dealers started to move huge amounts of cannabis out into Copenhagen and the rest of the country instead. This was done in order to avoid the heavy police-presence in Christiania and to meet the demand for cannabis by clients.\n\nThe open cannabis trade returned to ''Pusher Street'' after the 2004 raids, but the stalls were again torn down by Christiania's residents after the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]].<ref name=\"BBC-2016-09-02\"/> The hiatus on the open cannabis trade was short-lived; by May 2017, the stalls on Pusher Street were restored.\n\n== Further developments ==\nThe open cannabis trade in Christiania has been hailed by some [[Danes]] and condemned by others. The [[Centre-right politics|center-right]] government took a number of steps to enforce the law in Christiania. The first step in this process was a police crackdown on the cannabis trade. Both politicians and police declared that the cannabis trade would not be allowed to return. The second (and currently ongoing) phase is the registration of all buildings in Christiania. The third step will be the demolition of a number of wooden private residences situated in a nature conservation area (the historic naval fortress of Copenhagen). These buildings had all been approved by the authorities before the new government passed the current law on Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  For the last 15 years the government has not allowed construction in Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} This is now being enforced on a zero-tolerance policy with the help of a massive police presence.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Governmental normalization measures ===\nIn 2004, the Danish government passed a law abolishing the collective and treating its 900 members as individuals. Beginning in the summer of 2005, a series of protests were staged by Christiania members. During the same time, Danish police made frequent sweeps of the area.\n\nThe Christiania Caf\u00e9 ''M\u00e5nefiskeren'' set up a board recording the number of police patrols on Christiania in November 2005. In the summer of 2006 this passed the 1,000th patrol (about 4\u20136 patrols a day). These patrols normally consisted of 6 to 20 police officers, often dressed in combat uniform and sometimes with police dogs.\n\nIn January 2006, the government proposed that Christiania would be turned into a mixed alternative community and residential area adding [[condominium]]s for 400 new residents. Current residents, now paying [[Danish krone|DKK]] 1,450 (USD 250) per month, would be allowed to remain but need to begin paying normal rent for the facilities, albeit below market rent levels. Christiania has rejected this scenario, fearing the freetown would turn into a normal Copenhagen neighborhood. In particular, the concept of privately owned dwellings is claimed to be incompatible with Christiania's collective ownership.\n\nIn September 2007, the representatives of Christiania and Copenhagen's city council reached an agreement to cede control of Christiania to the city over the course of 10 years for the purposes of business development.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/18/farewelltofreetown | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Farewell to Freetown | date=2007-09-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Harriet | last=Riley}}</ref>  Also, as of May 2009, the [[Courts of Denmark|Eastern High Court]] upheld a 2004 Act of Parliament which reaffirmed the state's legal claim to control of the base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |title=Christiania loses court challenge |accessdate=2010-01-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811224214/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}</ref> This rule is confirmed in February 2011 by the Supreme Court. The state has now full right of disposal of the Christiania area.

In July 2012, they made the first payment, and the Christianites went from squatters to legal landowners. A foundation, run by residents, was set up to raise funds and apply for a bank loan. Christianites were able to buy about 19 acres of the initial 84-acre plot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-copenhagens-christiania-neighborhood-the-future-looks-more-settled/2012/09/06/cb1df946-ed38-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html|title=In Copenhagen\u2019s Christiania neighborhood, the future looks more settled|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>\n\nIn his January 2013 book ''In the Name of the People'', [[Ivo Mosley]] cited Christiania as one of the few examples of communities run on truly democratic lines that exist in the world. Six months later, the laws governing Christiania changed.

As a poet he was most influenced by the [[Parnassian poets]].\n\n==Biography==\nHerman Elroy Flecker was born on 5 November 1884 in [[Lewisham]], London, to William Herman Flecker (d. 1941), headmaster of [[Dean Close School]], Cheltenham, and his wife Sarah.<ref>Charles Williams: The Third Inkling, Grevel Lindop, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 380</ref> His much younger brother was the educationalist Henry Lael Oswald Flecker (1896-1958), who became Headmaster of [[Christ's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/henry-lael-oswald-flecker-18961958-headmaster-of-christs-hospital-69784 |title = Henry Lael Oswald Flecker (1896\u20131958), Headmaster of Christ's Hospital |publisher = Art UK |url-status=live |access-date = 22 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFlecker later chose to use the first name \"James\", either because he disliked the name \"Herman\" or to avoid confusion with his father. \"Roy\", as his family called him, was educated at Dean Close School, then at [[Uppingham School]]. He subsequently studied at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], and at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. While at Oxford he was greatly influenced by the last flowering of the [[Aesthetic movement]] there under [[John Addington Symonds]], and became a close friend of the classicist and art historian [[John Beazley]].<ref name=\"DoAH Bio\">{{cite web|title=Beazley, J[ohn] D[avidson], Sir|url=http://arthistorians.info/beazleyj\n|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1910 Flecker worked in the consular service in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. On a ship to [[Athens]] he met Helle Skiadaressi,<ref name=\"Walker\">Walker, Heather.  ''Roses and Rain'' (2006). Melrose Books. {{ISBN|1-905226-06-3}}</ref> and in 1911 he married her.\n\nFlecker died on 3 January 1915, of [[tuberculosis]], in [[Davos]], Switzerland but was buried in Cheltenham. His death at the age of thirty was described at the time as \"unquestionably the greatest premature loss that English literature has suffered since the death of Keats\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classiclit.about.com/cs/profileswriters/p/aa_jeflecker.htm |title=James Elroy Flecker, About.com |publisher=Classiclit.about.com |date=1915-01-03 |accessdate=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621165127/http://classiclit.about.com/cs/profileswriters/p/aa_jeflecker.htm |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Works and influence==\nThe excerpt from Flecker's verse drama ''Hassan  ...

(This is in fact a misquotation, the original reads \"...what should not be known\").\n\n[[Saki]]'s short story \"A Defensive Diamond\" (in ''[[Beasts and Super-Beasts]]'', 1914) references \"The Golden Journey to Samarkand\".\n\n[[Agatha Christie]] quotes Flecker several times, especially in her final novel, ''[[Postern of Fate]]'' (1973).\n\n[[Jorge Luis Borges]] quotes a quatrain from Flecker's poem \"To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence\" in his essay \"Note on [[Walt Whitman]]\" (available in the collection ''Other Inquisitions, 1937\u20131952''):\n\n{{quote|O friend unseen, unborn, unknown,<br>Student of our sweet English tongue,<br>Read out my words at night, alone:<br>I was a poet, I was young.}}\n\n[[Nevil Shute]] quotes from ''Hassan'' in ''[[Marazan]]'' (1926), his first published novel, and in the headings of many of the chapters in his 1951 novel [[Round the Bend (novel)|''Round the Bend'']].\n\nThe Pilgrims' Song from ''Hassan'' and its setting by Delius play a pivotal role at the beginning of [[Elizabeth Goudge]]'s novel ''The Castle on the Hill'' (1942).<ref>Elizabeth Goudge, ''The Castle on the Hill'', Chapters I.i, II.i</ref>\n\n[[Diana Rigg]] quotes an amended stanza (not the original)  from ''Hassan'' in the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' as she looks out of the window of Piz Gloria at the sun rising over the Swiss alps:\n\n{{quote|Thy dawn, O Master of the World, thy dawn;<br>For thee the sunlight creeps across the lawn,<br>For thee the ships are drawn down to the waves,<br>For thee the markets throng with myriad slaves,<br>For thee the hammer on the anvil rings,<br>For thee the poet of beguilement sings.}}\n\nThe original in Flecker's play is more romantic, and makes clear that the Caliph is being addressed, not the Almighty:\n{{quote|Thy dawn O Master of the world, thy dawn;<br>The hour the lilies open on the lawn,<br>The hour the grey wings pass beyond the mountains,<br>The hour of silence, when we hear the fountains,<br>The hour that dreams are brighter and winds colder,<br>The hour that young love wakes on a white shoulder,<br>O Master of the world, the Persian Dawn.<br><br>That hour, O Master, shall be bright for thee:<br>Thy merchants chase the morning down the sea,<br>The braves who fight thy war unsheathe the sabre,<br>The slaves who work thy mines are lashed to labour,<br>For thee the waggons of the world are drawn  - <br>The ebony of night, the red of dawn!}}In ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'' (1973), author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] concludes a final scene with a [[decasyllable]] [[quatrain]] [[pastiche]] in Flecker\u2019s style.  Following many misadventures suffered by the book\u2019s picaresque hero Harry Flashman, brother-in-arms rebel leader [[Yakub Beg]] waxes poetic and evokes the mystique of middle Asia with its concomitant voyage of self-discovery and friendships hard won by reciting:\n\n{{quote|To learn the age-old lesson day by day:<br>It is not in the bright arrival planned,<br>But in the dreams men dream along the way,<br>They find the Golden Road to Samarkand.}}\n\nFlecker's poem \"The Bridge of Fire\" features in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' series, in the volume ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'', and ''The Golden Journey to Samarkand'' is quoted in the volume ''[[The Sandman: World's End|World's End]]''.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''The Bridge of Fire'' (1907)\n*''Thirty-Six Poems'' (1910)\n*''Forty-Two Poems'' (1911) ([[e-book]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/3039 |title=Forty-Two Poems by James Elroy Flecker - Free Ebook |publisher=Gutenberg.net |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n*''The Golden Journey to Samarkand'' (1913)\n*''The Old Ships'' (1915)\n*''Collected Poems'' (1916)\n\n===Novels===\n*''The Last Generation: A Story of the Future'' (1908)\n*''The King of Alsander'' (1914)\n\n===Drama===\n*''Hassan'' (1922; full title ''Hassan: The Story of Hassan of Baghdad and How he Came to Make the Golden Journey to Samarkand'')\n:*Incidental music to the play was written by [[Frederick Delius]] in 1920, before the play's publication, and first performed in September 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thompsonian.info/Articles/delius-hassan-review-1923.html |title=Delius-hassan-review-1923 |publisher=Thompsonian.info |date=1923-09-29 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n*''Don Juan'' (1925)\n\n===Other===\n*''The Grecians'' (1910)\n*''The Scholars' Italian Book'' (1911)\n*''Collected Prose'' (1920)\n*''The Letters of J.E.

They are a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents. They attempt to create a new order within the [[Ministry of Magic]] by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition are the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n\nDeath Eaters recognise one another by the [[Dark Mark]], a [[sigil]] branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and black masks. The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', although individual members of the group, such as [[Severus Snape]], [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] had appeared in earlier books in the series.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Pre-Harry Potter ===\nThe Death Eaters first existed 11 years before the events of the books, torturing and murdering Muggles, as well as anyone who opposed them. They also did this to people who were blood traitors(Ronald Weasley). Around 10 years after the Death Eaters first surfaced, a Seer named [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy about a boy who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever. The prophecy could have referred to two different boys, [[Harry Potter]] or [[Neville Longbottom]]; however, Voldemort chose Harry as said in the prophecy, that \"the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal\". As Voldemort was a half-blood, he chose his \"equal\", Harry, whose mother was a Muggle-born witch, instead of Neville, who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards. Acting on information from [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]]'s Secret-Keeper [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival. Due to Harry's mother's sacrifice to save her son, Voldemort's deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort.\n\nWith Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry Potter, the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished. The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison [[Azkaban]],  but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the [[Imperius Curse]] (it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so) or by turning in other Death Eaters, as [[#Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] did; Harry witnesses Karkaroff's testimony against former Death Eaters in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Pensieve]] during the course of the series. It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him (like [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]), since, in the sixth book, Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell, then he would have very few followers. The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort. Voldemort takes notice of this and claims that they will be rewarded above all others for their great loyalty.  Snape's position as a Death Eater is unique - during the books he convinces all (with the exception of Dumbledore) that he is working for whichever side requires it at that time.  This is due to his skill at [[Occlumency]] allowing him to disguise his true motive - a love for Lily Potter - from Voldemort.\n\n=== Re-emergence ===\nEarly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' a group of Death Eaters rallied after the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. They gathered to form a large spectacle and disturbance which spread instant chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community. Their appearance alone created hysteria, and their numbers grew while they tortured Muggles and Muggle-borns on site. It concluded when the Dark Mark was produced in the sky by Barty Crouch Jr, frightening Death Eaters and Ministry officials alike.\n[[File:Morkets MerkeTMB2007.png|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nVoldemort, having regained his full strength at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew's Dark Mark. Except for Severus Snape (who was staying at Hogwarts to \"maintain his cover\") and those dead, imprisoned, or afraid to return, the majority returned to his service as Voldemort began his second attempt to claim all power.\n\nVoldemort states at his rebirth, \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters...three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return...he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever...he will be killed, of course...and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"\nBased on mentions and later happenings in the books, it can be deduced that the one \"too cowardly to return\" is Igor Karkaroff. The one \"who I believe has left me forever\" is Severus Snape, who returns two hours later to explain his absence and convince Voldemort that he is a spy for him. The \"most faithful servant\" is Barty Crouch Jr., who has already been in place at Hogwarts working for Voldemort. The three dead include Evan Rosier, Wilkes and Regulus Black.\n\nThe Minister of Magic ([[Cornelius Fudge]]) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, who Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry's refusal to remove the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors]] from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Voldemort sent a group of twelve Death Eaters, led by [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], into the Department of Mysteries, where he expected them to secure a prophecy of vital importance to him: having originally attacked Harry Potter based upon a partial recounting of it, he now wanted to hear the full version to better, or even fully, understand the connection between Harry and himself.  The raid on the Department failed, however; Harry Potter and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the prophecy out of their hands, finally destroying it, and were eventually aided by Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore captured eleven of the twelve Death Eaters, sending Voldemort and Bellatrix fleeing after a fierce duel with the former, and ending the Death Eaters' enjoyed secrecy.  Lucius, who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry, was captured and imprisoned.  However, the Death Eaters regrouped, assassinating and kidnapping important wizards, killing [[Muggle]]s, and in general spreading terror and chaos through the Wizarding world.  Soon after Lucius' capture, his son Draco Malfoy is made a Death Eater, and given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore, although this task is eventually performed by Severus Snape.\n\nTowards the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders.  A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him.  Voldemort's death signalled the end of all Death Eaters.\n\n=== Ideology ===\nVoldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a [[Racism|racist]] ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a [[racial hierarchy]], above all other magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, \"Nature's Nobility\"; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to [[Blood traitor|blood purity]]; \"pure bloods\" (those with only wizards as parents) out-rank \"half-bloods\" (mixed parentage) and \"mudbloods\", a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents ([[Muggles]]). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], the Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called \"blood traitors\" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.\n\nIn reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer \u2013 Voldemort himself is a [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] \u2013 and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, [[Squib (Harry Potter)|Squibs]], and half-bloods from their family records. On the other hand, \"in rare circumstances\" a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater.<ref name=\"JKRfestival\">{{cite web|author1=J.K.Rowling Official Site|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|accessdate=8 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222074210/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|archivedate=22 December 2011|date=15 August 2004}}</ref> They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior, as proven by [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] [[#Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and the [[Gurg|giant]] clan from continental Europe, as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda.\n\nThe Death Eaters seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world, wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of pure-bloods. The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule.  During their control over the Ministry of Magic, they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards, sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors.\n\n=== Death Eaters and their crimes ===\n<!-- NOTE: Narcissa Malfoy is NOT!! a Death Eater, as stated by J.K.

Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a \"stocky little woman\" and shares her brother's squatness and laugh. It is said that after Voldemort's first downfall, they believed that he was gone forever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |title=Rowling's website FAQ about Carrows |accessdate=8 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510030650/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Alecto and Amycus become \"teachers\" at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but as [[Neville Longbottom]] puts it, it becomes just \"[[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|The Dark Arts]]\" in which students are forced to perform the [[Cruciatus Curse]] against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches [[Muggle Studies]], which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that [[Muggle]]s are like animals. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts, Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort's orders, preparing to capture Harry, but is stunned by [[Luna Lovegood]] after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort. Amycus, after seeing what happened, tries to conspire with [[Minerva McGonagall]] who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark. McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus, who spits in her face. Enraged at this, Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse, with such power that Amycus passes out. Later, McGonagall places the Imperius Curse on him, then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net.\n\n[[Ralph Ineson]] plays Amycus, and [[Suzie Toase]] appears as Alecto in the films, wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles. In the second part of the final film, Snape deflects a spell from McGonagall which hits the Carrows, possibly to protect the students from their abuses and to show his allegiance to Dumbledore.\n\n=== Barty Crouch Jr. ===\n'''Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch, Junior''' was captured with [[Bellatrix Lestrange and Rodolophus Lestrange]], who tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom, parents of [[Neville Longbottom]], into insanity. His father, [[Barty Crouch Sr.]], who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time, sentenced him to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. However, he later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife. When they visit him in Azkaban, Mrs. Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son, enabling him to escape while she remains in his place. When she dies, she is buried under his identity. Crouch Jr. is nursed back to health by [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Winky|Winky]], the family's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#House-elves|house-elf]].\n\nTo prevent him from returning to Voldemort's service, Crouch Sr. controls his son with the Imperius Curse and keeps him hidden under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]]. When [[Bertha Jorkins]] discovers the truth, the news reaches Voldemort, who rescues Crouch Jr. and puts Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse. Crouch Jr. then imprisons [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], a famous auror, and using Polyjuice Potion, assumes Moody's appearance and position to infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Despite not being a real teacher, Crouch Jr. does a fair job and the class learns vast amounts from him, including valuable knowledge related to the three \"unforgivable curses\". Crouch Sr. escapes and, exhausted and delirious from the Imperius Curse, reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort's return; but his loyal Death-Eater son murders him on the castle grounds, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries the bone in freshly turned earth in front of Hagrid's cabin.<ref>Rowling, J.K. ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (New York: Arthur A. Levine Books, 2000), pages 690 and 691</ref>\n\nThe revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr. with making sure Harry wins. To do so, he bewitches [[Viktor Krum]] to attack [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] in the maze and to stun [[Fleur Delacour]]. When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup, which is a [[Portkeys|portkey]], it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton, home of the Riddle family. There, after killing Cedric, [[Scabbers|Death Eater Peter Pettigrew]] uses Harry's blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort. The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry, but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort's wand, Harry escapes via the Portkey.\n\nWhen Harry reappears at Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch Jr. hopes to succeed where his master failed; but Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall foil his plot. Under the effects of [[Veritaserum]], he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementor]] acting as bodyguard to Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it. Crouch lives bereft of his memories or sense of self.\n\nHe is played by [[David Tennant]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.\n\n=== Antonin Dolohov ===\n'''Antonin Dolohov''' has a long, pale, and twisted face, with a name that suggests he is of Slavic descent. He is confirmed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to be one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters, being present at the Hog's Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the [[diadem]] [[Horcrux]], c. 1956. This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)#Synopsis|Gideon and Fabian Prewett]] ([[Molly Weasley]]'s brothers). He also tortures many [[Muggle]]s and opponents of Voldemort during the first war. Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.\n\nHe participates in the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]], where he causes injury to Hermione, but is imprisoned again, and returns to [[Azkaban]] prison. He escapes once more some time before the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. He tracks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort's name (which had recently been made taboo). He and his companion Rowle are stunned, and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort. Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing [[Remus Lupin]],<ref name=webchat/> whom [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] last sees fighting with him. He is also seen dueling with [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] until [[Parvati Patil]] uses the Body-bind Curse on him. Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry, and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up. When the battle recommences, [[Professor Flitwick]] finally defeats him.\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Arben Bajraktaraj]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''.\n\n=== Fenrir Greyback ===\n'''Fenrir Greyback''' is a [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] who is involved with the Death Eaters. He works alongside Lord Voldemort because Lord Voldemort promises fairness to werewolves around the country. He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater.<ref name=\"HP7ref\"/> He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people including the young [[Remus Lupin]], when Lupin's father had angered Greyback. Greyback is known for targeting young children. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore's death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars [[Bill Weasley]]. Although Greyback does not transmit his [[lycanthropy]] because he was in human form at the time, Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very [[rare meat]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Greyback leads a Snatcher gang \u2013 Dark wizards looking for [[Muggle-born]]s and \"Undesirables\" in exchange for gold. When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort's name after it has been made taboo, Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services, but the prisoners fight their way out and escape, Greyback being hit by a triple Stunning Spell. Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Hermione, using a blasting curse, prevents Greyback from attacking injured [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], and a crystal ball thrown by [[Professor Trelawney]] stuns him. He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters' last stand, when [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] combine forces to take him down by magic.\n\n[[Dave Legeno]] portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He reprised the role in both parts of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n=== Igor Karkaroff ===\n'''Igor Karkaroff''' ([[Cyrillic]]: \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432) is the Headmaster at [[Durmstrang]] Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and [[Beauxbatons]] Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as \"a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare\". Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch17\">{{HP4}}, chapter 17</ref> Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian [[Quidditch]] player [[Viktor Krum]].\n[[Sirius Black]] later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch19\">{{HP4}}, chapter 19</ref> Karkaroff was captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. Karkaroff later told the [[Ministry of Magic]] that he had seen the error of his ways, and \"named names\", putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\">{{HP4}}, chapter 30</ref> Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters. Karkaroff's history gives him a connection with [[Severus Snape|Snape]], also a former Death Eater. Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape, and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing. He also apparently has an unpleasant history with Alastor Moody, and tries to avoid him unsuccessfully for the entirety of the tournament, not knowing that it is Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch27\">{{HP4}}, chapter 27</ref> At the end of the novel, following Voldemort's return, Karkaroff goes into hiding, leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang. In the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters. Lupin also expresses surprise that Karkaroff managed to live even a year after deserting Voldemort and that no one else has been known to avoid capture quite as long.\n\n[[Predrag Bjelac]] appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire''.\n\n=== Bellatrix Lestrange ===\n'''Bellatrix Lestrange''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') is the first female Death Eater introduced in the books. She was introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix''. She is  the most faithful member of Voldemort's inner circle.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch33\">{{HP4}}, chapter 33</ref> She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban. Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid, insane, and fanatically devoted to Voldemort, seeing service to him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch. Bellatrix takes an obvious pleasure in acts of torture and cruelty, as demonstrated when she kills her cousin, Sirius Black. She is a witch of prodigious ability, as demonstrated by her many victories in duels against other characters, and as noted by Harry in the final book.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch23\">{{HP7}}, chapter 23</ref> Her wand is [[walnut]], 12 {{frac|3|4}}&nbsp;inches, dragon heartstring, unyielding and according to [[Ollivander]] should be treated carefully.\n\nBellatrix was born Bellatrix Black to Cygnus Black and Druella Rosier in the year 1951 and has two sisters, [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] (who was disowned by the family for marrying Muggle-born Ted Tonks, which her pure-blood family saw as betrayal; therefore, she was consequently blasted off the family tree) and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] (wife of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and mother to [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]). She is also a first cousin to [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and Regulus Black, and an aunt to [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts because it was \"expected of her to marry a pure-blood\". However, the marriage was loveless, and Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix's true love was Voldemort.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Dumbledore's  [[pensieve]] is used as a [[Exposition (literary technique)|plot device]] to reveal that Bellatrix, rather than deserting Voldemort after his downfall like many other Death Eaters, was part of the group \u2013 along with Barty Crouch Jr, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange \u2013 that [[torture]]d the respected [[Auror]]s [[Frank and Alice Longbottom]] (Neville Longbottom's parents) in an attempt to gain information about Voldemort's location.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\" /> For using the unforgivable [[Cruciatus Curse]] to torture the Longbottoms to insanity, Bellatrix and her three associates were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. During the trial, she said Voldemort would rise again and reward them. When Voldemort has his body renewed, he reflects that the Lestranges went to [[Azkaban]] rather than renounce him and that they will be deeply rewarded when Azkaban is broken open.\n\nSeveral months after her master's resurrection, Bellatrix is one of the many Death Eaters who escape Azkaban and rejoin him. She is present at the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', in which a group of Death Eaters attempt to steal [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s [[prophecy]] pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. Rowling demonstrates Bellatrix's ability during the mission when she overpowers her niece Tonks and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] in one-on-one duels, kills her cousin Sirius by blasting him through the veil in the Death Chamber, and deflects one of Dumbledore's spells as she makes her escape. Harry attempts to use the Cruciatus Curse on her in revenge for killing Sirius, but the curse is ineffective due to the lack of real cruelty behind it. Voldemort suddenly appears but moments later, Bellatrix is subdued by Dumbledore in the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s atrium as he prepares to duel Voldemort. Unable to overcome Dumbledore, Voldemort rescues Bellatrix by [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Apparition and Disapparition|disapparating]] with her.\n\nAt the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Bellatrix attempts to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Snape at [[Spinner's End]], and she is furious to learn that Snape already knows about the plan. Rowling used the conversation between Snape and Bellatrix to imply that Voldemort is still furious at Bellatrix's failure in the previous book.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch2\">{{HP6}}, chapter 2</ref> That conversation also suggests that Bellatrix mistrusts Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Snape surprises Bellatrix by replying to each of her arguments and by agreeing to create an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to assist Draco in his mission to assassinate [[Dumbledore]]. Later in the book, it is mentioned by Snape that Bellatrix had been teaching [[occlumency]] to Draco, in an effort to aid him with his mission. In the film, she and Fenrir Greyback arrive at the Burrow (the Weasley house) and burn it down. Harry and Ginny chase after them, with Bellatrix taunting \"I killed Sirius Black!\". In the film, she is one of several Death Eaters smuggled into Hogwarts using a pair of Vanishing Cabinets to assassinate Dumbledore, though she does not take part in this mission in the book.\n\nBellatrix later becomes the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''. The first chapter of the book implies that Voldemort has yet to forgive Bellatrix for her failure, as he mocks her with the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf [[Remus Lupin]].<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch1\">{{HP7}}, chapter 1</ref> However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to \"prune\" her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]' home; during the attack, Bellatrix devotes much of her energies in efforts to kill Tonks, but is unsuccessful.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch5\">{{HP7}}, chapter 5</ref> In this book, Bellatrix inadvertently reveals she is the guardian of [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup, when the captured Harry, Ron, and Hermione are brought to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse, believing them to have sneaked into her vault at Gringotts due to their possession of [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Godric Gryffindor's sword]], but [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]] appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using polyjuice potion, to gain access to the Lestranges' Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his hunt for the [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]] only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. Rowling stated in an interview that, during the battle, it was Bellatrix who killed Tonks.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], proving more than a match for all three, and nearly hits Ginny with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. An enraged [[Molly Weasley]] engages Bellatrix and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.<ref name=\"the-leaky-cauldron.org\">\"[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows New Interview with J.K.

He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends because Hermione has Muggle parents, Draco was also assigned to kill Dumbledore, but his heart told him otherwise and Snape had to do it for him. Draco, like his family, is part of the Slytherin house. Some people call him gay.\n\n===Lucius Malfoy===\n'''Lucius Malfoy''' is a Death Eater, head of a wealthy [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|pure-blood]] wizarding family and a psychopath; he lives with his wife [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (n\u00e9e Black) and their son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at the [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. Lucius was a [[trustee|school governor]] of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. To maintain his reputation and influence, he makes donations to the Ministry, to charity, and to [[St Mungo's (Harry Potter)|St Mungo's Hospital]]. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.\n\nHe debuts as the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', in which just before Draco and Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants [[Tom Riddle's diary]] in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s [[Potions Class|potions]] cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at [[Flourish & Blotts]], in a plot to use her to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], which would lead to attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students.\n\nLucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it is a [[horcrux]] containing a part of Voldemort's soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, [[Arthur Weasley]], and Dumbledore. Lucius' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school's Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster.\n\nSubsequently, Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free. Upon this, Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm. Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor. Despite his sacking, he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.\n\nLucius next appears in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' during the [[Quidditch]] World Cup, sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Later in that book, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master, who however remains unimpressed. Harry reports Malfoy's declarations to Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him. Thus, the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HP4}}, chapter 36</ref>\n\nDuring the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]] breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.\n\nBy the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear, having lost Voldemort's favour. Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort borrows Lucius' wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest.\n\nDespite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son. He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book. Following Voldemort's death, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco all manage to \"''weasel their way out''\" of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa's aiding Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in 2006, Lucius Malfoy was number 12<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS NUMBER.

There, he was a close friend of [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and [[Remus Lupin]], although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group. With Sirius and James' help, Pettigrew becomes an [[Animagus]], with the ability to transform at will into a [[rat]]. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son, Harry, is Voldemort's target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily's death (and ironically, Voldemort's near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders. Pettigrew is (seemingly posthumously) awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as [[Percy Weasley]]'s pet, and then as [[Ron Weasley]]'s. In this form (named \"Scabbers\" by the family), he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off.\n\nAlthough Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is the main antagonist. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the ''Daily Prophet'' newspaper, Sirius recognises Pettigrew's Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down. The two confront each other in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his treachery, claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, to prove Sirius' innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry's actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt.\n\nPettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of [[Albania]] and helping him to return to a feeble baby's body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named [[Bertha Jorkins]], who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as \"Wormtail\" hereafter) assists [[#Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] in overpowering [[Mad-Eye Moody]], setting up the events in the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Wormtail murders [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] on Voldemort's orders, and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as one of the ingredients. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Wormtail's missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Wormtail's fortunes remain low; in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' Snape treats him as a servant, and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Wormtail checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Wormtail begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Wormtail hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity. Harry Potter thinks of him and describes it as having regrets.\n\nPettigrew is portrayed by [[Timothy Spall]] as an adult, and by [[Charles Hughes (actor)|Charles Hughes]] as a teenager in the films. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'', Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed. He only appears in a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\n[[IGN]]'s Joe Utichi also listed him as his 10th top ''Harry Potter'' character.<ref name=\"Joe Top\" />\n\n=== Severus Snape ===\n{{Main|Severus Snape}}\n'''Severus Snape''' is characterised as a person of considerable complexity, whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish. In the first novel of the series, Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and is built up to be the primary [[antagonist]] until the final chapters. As the series progresses, Snape's portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex, pivotal character of moral ambiguity, whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end. Snape is, as revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', actually a spy in Voldemort's ranks for Dumbledore.\n\n=== Corban Yaxley ===\n'''Corban'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pottermore Presents - Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> '''Yaxley''' is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort's spies in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of [[Charity Burbage]], and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry's departure from the Dursleys', but [[John Dawlish]], an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information. Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the Imperius Curse upon [[Pius Thicknesse]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.\n\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin's locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists [[Dolores Umbridge]] in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters, but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to.\n\nHe participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with [[Professor Flitwick]] and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time. When the battle resumes, he is defeated by [[Fred and George Weasley|George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]].\n\n[[Peter Mullan]] plays Yaxley in the film adaptation of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{hpw|Death Eaters}}\n* [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/death_eaters.html The Harry Potter Lexicon item] on Death Eaters\n* [http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/pronunciation/play.htm How to pronounce Bellatrix's name] at the official [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613095313/http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/pottercast/episode/show/52 PotterCast #40: Bag of 'trix] \u2013 A podcast debating Bellatrix's role in the series\n* [http://slate.com/id/2123105 When Harry Met Osama.

They are a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents. They attempt to create a new order within the [[Ministry of Magic]] by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition are the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n\nDeath Eaters recognise one another by the [[Dark Mark]], a [[sigil]] branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and black masks. The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', although individual members of the group, such as [[Severus Snape]], [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] had appeared in earlier books in the series.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Pre-Harry Potter ===\nThe Death Eaters first existed 11 years before the events of the books, torturing and murdering Muggles, as well as anyone who opposed them. They also did this to people who were blood traitors(Ronald Weasley). Around 10 years after the Death Eaters first surfaced, a Seer named [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy about a boy who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever. The prophecy could have referred to two different boys, [[Harry Potter]] or [[Neville Longbottom]]; however, Voldemort chose Harry as said in the prophecy, that \"the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal\". As Voldemort was a half-blood, he chose his \"equal\", Harry, whose mother was a Muggle-born witch, instead of Neville, who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards. Acting on information from [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]]'s Secret-Keeper [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival. Due to Harry's mother's sacrifice to save her son, Voldemort's deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort.\n\nWith Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry Potter, the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished. The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison [[Azkaban]],  but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the [[Imperius Curse]] (it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so) or by turning in other Death Eaters, as [[#Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] did; Harry witnesses Karkaroff's testimony against former Death Eaters in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Pensieve]] during the course of the series. It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him (like [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]), since, in the sixth book, Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell, then he would have very few followers. The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort. Voldemort takes notice of this and claims that they will be rewarded above all others for their great loyalty.  Snape's position as a Death Eater is unique - during the books he convinces all (with the exception of Dumbledore) that he is working for whichever side requires it at that time.  This is due to his skill at [[Occlumency]] allowing him to disguise his true motive - a love for Lily Potter - from Voldemort.\n\n=== Re-emergence ===\nEarly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' a group of Death Eaters rallied after the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. They gathered to form a large spectacle and disturbance which spread instant chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community. Their appearance alone created hysteria, and their numbers grew while they tortured Muggles and Muggle-borns on site. It concluded when the Dark Mark was produced in the sky by Barty Crouch Jr, frightening Death Eaters and Ministry officials alike.\n[[File:Morkets MerkeTMB2007.png|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nVoldemort, having regained his full strength at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew's Dark Mark. Except for Severus Snape (who was staying at Hogwarts to \"maintain his cover\") and those dead, imprisoned, or afraid to return, the majority returned to his service as Voldemort began his second attempt to claim all power.\n\nVoldemort states at his rebirth, \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters...three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return...he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever...he will be killed, of course...and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"\nBased on mentions and later happenings in the books, it can be deduced that the one \"too cowardly to return\" is Igor Karkaroff. The one \"who I believe has left me forever\" is Severus Snape, who returns two hours later to explain his absence and convince Voldemort that he is a spy for him. The \"most faithful servant\" is Barty Crouch Jr., who has already been in place at Hogwarts working for Voldemort. The three dead include Evan Rosier, Wilkes and Regulus Black.\n\nThe Minister of Magic ([[Cornelius Fudge]]) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, who Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry's refusal to remove the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors]] from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Voldemort sent a group of twelve Death Eaters, led by [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], into the Department of Mysteries, where he expected them to secure a prophecy of vital importance to him: having originally attacked Harry Potter based upon a partial recounting of it, he now wanted to hear the full version to better, or even fully, understand the connection between Harry and himself.  The raid on the Department failed, however; Harry Potter and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the prophecy out of their hands, finally destroying it, and were eventually aided by Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore captured eleven of the twelve Death Eaters, sending Voldemort and Bellatrix fleeing after a fierce duel with the former, and ending the Death Eaters' enjoyed secrecy.  Lucius, who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry, was captured and imprisoned.  However, the Death Eaters regrouped, assassinating and kidnapping important wizards, killing [[Muggle]]s, and in general spreading terror and chaos through the Wizarding world.  Soon after Lucius' capture, his son Draco Malfoy is made a Death Eater, and given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore, although this task is eventually performed by Severus Snape.\n\nTowards the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders.  A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him.  Voldemort's death signalled the end of all Death Eaters.\n\n=== Ideology ===\nVoldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a [[Racism|racist]] ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a [[racial hierarchy]], above all other magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, \"Nature's Nobility\"; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to [[Blood traitor|blood purity]]; \"pure bloods\" (those with only wizards as parents) out-rank \"half-bloods\" (mixed parentage) and \"mudbloods\", a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents ([[Muggles]]). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], the Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called \"blood traitors\" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.\n\nIn reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer \u2013 Voldemort himself is a [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] \u2013 and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, [[Squib (Harry Potter)|Squibs]], and half-bloods from their family records.

The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule.  During their control over the Ministry of Magic, they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards, sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors.\n\n=== Death Eaters and their crimes ===\n<!-- NOTE: Narcissa Malfoy is NOT!! a Death Eater, as stated by J.K.

Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a \"stocky little woman\" and shares her brother's squatness and laugh. It is said that after Voldemort's first downfall, they believed that he was gone forever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |title=Rowling's website FAQ about Carrows |accessdate=8 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510030650/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Alecto and Amycus become \"teachers\" at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but as [[Neville Longbottom]] puts it, it becomes just \"[[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|The Dark Arts]]\" in which students are forced to perform the [[Cruciatus Curse]] against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches [[Muggle Studies]], which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that [[Muggle]]s are like animals. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts, Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort's orders, preparing to capture Harry, but is stunned by [[Luna Lovegood]] after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort. Amycus, after seeing what happened, tries to conspire with [[Minerva McGonagall]] who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark. McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus, who spits in her face. Enraged at this, Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse, with such power that Amycus passes out. Later, McGonagall places the Imperius Curse on him, then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net.\n\n[[Ralph Ineson]] plays Amycus, and [[Suzie Toase]] appears as Alecto in the films, wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles. In the second part of the final film, Snape deflects a spell from McGonagall which hits the Carrows, possibly to protect the students from their abuses and to show his allegiance to Dumbledore.\n\n=== Barty Crouch Jr. ===\n'''Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch, Junior''' was captured with [[Bellatrix Lestrange and Rodolophus Lestrange]], who tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom, parents of [[Neville Longbottom]], into insanity. His father, [[Barty Crouch Sr.]], who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time, sentenced him to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. However, he later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife. When they visit him in Azkaban, Mrs. Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son, enabling him to escape while she remains in his place. When she dies, she is buried under his identity. Crouch Jr. is nursed back to health by [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Winky|Winky]], the family's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#House-elves|house-elf]].\n\nTo prevent him from returning to Voldemort's service, Crouch Sr. controls his son with the Imperius Curse and keeps him hidden under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]]. When [[Bertha Jorkins]] discovers the truth, the news reaches Voldemort, who rescues Crouch Jr. and puts Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse. Crouch Jr. then imprisons [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], a famous auror, and using Polyjuice Potion, assumes Moody's appearance and position to infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Despite not being a real teacher, Crouch Jr. does a fair job and the class learns vast amounts from him, including valuable knowledge related to the three \"unforgivable curses\". Crouch Sr. escapes and, exhausted and delirious from the Imperius Curse, reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort's return; but his loyal Death-Eater son murders him on the castle grounds, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries the bone in freshly turned earth in front of Hagrid's cabin.<ref>Rowling, J.K. ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (New York: Arthur A. Levine Books, 2000), pages 690 and 691</ref>\n\nThe revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr. with making sure Harry wins. To do so, he bewitches [[Viktor Krum]] to attack [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] in the maze and to stun [[Fleur Delacour]]. When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup, which is a [[Portkeys|portkey]], it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton, home of the Riddle family. There, after killing Cedric, [[Scabbers|Death Eater Peter Pettigrew]] uses Harry's blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort. The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry, but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort's wand, Harry escapes via the Portkey.\n\nWhen Harry reappears at Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch Jr. hopes to succeed where his master failed; but Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall foil his plot. Under the effects of [[Veritaserum]], he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementor]] acting as bodyguard to Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it. Crouch lives bereft of his memories or sense of self.\n\nHe is played by [[David Tennant]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.\n\n=== Antonin Dolohov ===\n'''Antonin Dolohov''' has a long, pale, and twisted face, with a name that suggests he is of Slavic descent. He is confirmed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to be one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters, being present at the Hog's Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the [[diadem]] [[Horcrux]], c. 1956. This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)#Synopsis|Gideon and Fabian Prewett]] ([[Molly Weasley]]'s brothers). He also tortures many [[Muggle]]s and opponents of Voldemort during the first war. Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.\n\nHe participates in the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]], where he causes injury to Hermione, but is imprisoned again, and returns to [[Azkaban]] prison. He escapes once more some time before the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. He tracks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort's name (which had recently been made taboo). He and his companion Rowle are stunned, and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort. Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing [[Remus Lupin]],<ref name=webchat/> whom [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] last sees fighting with him. He is also seen dueling with [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] until [[Parvati Patil]] uses the Body-bind Curse on him. Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry, and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up. When the battle recommences, [[Professor Flitwick]] finally defeats him.\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Arben Bajraktaraj]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''.\n\n=== Fenrir Greyback ===\n'''Fenrir Greyback''' is a [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] who is involved with the Death Eaters. He works alongside Lord Voldemort because Lord Voldemort promises fairness to werewolves around the country. He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater.<ref name=\"HP7ref\"/> He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people including the young [[Remus Lupin]], when Lupin's father had angered Greyback. Greyback is known for targeting young children. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore's death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars [[Bill Weasley]]. Although Greyback does not transmit his [[lycanthropy]] because he was in human form at the time, Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very [[rare meat]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Greyback leads a Snatcher gang \u2013 Dark wizards looking for [[Muggle-born]]s and \"Undesirables\" in exchange for gold. When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort's name after it has been made taboo, Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services, but the prisoners fight their way out and escape, Greyback being hit by a triple Stunning Spell. Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Hermione, using a blasting curse, prevents Greyback from attacking injured [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], and a crystal ball thrown by [[Professor Trelawney]] stuns him. He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters' last stand, when [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] combine forces to take him down by magic.\n\n[[Dave Legeno]] portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He reprised the role in both parts of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n=== Igor Karkaroff ===\n'''Igor Karkaroff''' ([[Cyrillic]]: \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432) is the Headmaster at [[Durmstrang]] Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and [[Beauxbatons]] Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as \"a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare\". Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch17\">{{HP4}}, chapter 17</ref> Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian [[Quidditch]] player [[Viktor Krum]].\n[[Sirius Black]] later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch19\">{{HP4}}, chapter 19</ref> Karkaroff was captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. Karkaroff later told the [[Ministry of Magic]] that he had seen the error of his ways, and \"named names\", putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\">{{HP4}}, chapter 30</ref> Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters. Karkaroff's history gives him a connection with [[Severus Snape|Snape]], also a former Death Eater. Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape, and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing. He also apparently has an unpleasant history with Alastor Moody, and tries to avoid him unsuccessfully for the entirety of the tournament, not knowing that it is Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch27\">{{HP4}}, chapter 27</ref> At the end of the novel, following Voldemort's return, Karkaroff goes into hiding, leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang. In the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters. Lupin also expresses surprise that Karkaroff managed to live even a year after deserting Voldemort and that no one else has been known to avoid capture quite as long.\n\n[[Predrag Bjelac]] appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire''.\n\n=== Bellatrix Lestrange ===\n'''Bellatrix Lestrange''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') is the first female Death Eater introduced in the books. She was introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix''. She is  the most faithful member of Voldemort's inner circle.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch33\">{{HP4}}, chapter 33</ref> She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban. Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid, insane, and fanatically devoted to Voldemort, seeing service to him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch. Bellatrix takes an obvious pleasure in acts of torture and cruelty, as demonstrated when she kills her cousin, Sirius Black. She is a witch of prodigious ability, as demonstrated by her many victories in duels against other characters, and as noted by Harry in the final book.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch23\">{{HP7}}, chapter 23</ref> Her wand is [[walnut]], 12 {{frac|3|4}}&nbsp;inches, dragon heartstring, unyielding and according to [[Ollivander]] should be treated carefully.\n\nBellatrix was born Bellatrix Black to Cygnus Black and Druella Rosier in the year 1951 and has two sisters, [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] (who was disowned by the family for marrying Muggle-born Ted Tonks, which her pure-blood family saw as betrayal; therefore, she was consequently blasted off the family tree) and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] (wife of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and mother to [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]). She is also a first cousin to [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and Regulus Black, and an aunt to [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts because it was \"expected of her to marry a pure-blood\". However, the marriage was loveless, and Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix's true love was Voldemort.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Dumbledore's  [[pensieve]] is used as a [[Exposition (literary technique)|plot device]] to reveal that Bellatrix, rather than deserting Voldemort after his downfall like many other Death Eaters, was part of the group \u2013 along with Barty Crouch Jr, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange \u2013 that [[torture]]d the respected [[Auror]]s [[Frank and Alice Longbottom]] (Neville Longbottom's parents) in an attempt to gain information about Voldemort's location.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\" /> For using the unforgivable [[Cruciatus Curse]] to torture the Longbottoms to insanity, Bellatrix and her three associates were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. During the trial, she said Voldemort would rise again and reward them. When Voldemort has his body renewed, he reflects that the Lestranges went to [[Azkaban]] rather than renounce him and that they will be deeply rewarded when Azkaban is broken open.\n\nSeveral months after her master's resurrection, Bellatrix is one of the many Death Eaters who escape Azkaban and rejoin him. She is present at the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', in which a group of Death Eaters attempt to steal [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s [[prophecy]] pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. Rowling demonstrates Bellatrix's ability during the mission when she overpowers her niece Tonks and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] in one-on-one duels, kills her cousin Sirius by blasting him through the veil in the Death Chamber, and deflects one of Dumbledore's spells as she makes her escape. Harry attempts to use the Cruciatus Curse on her in revenge for killing Sirius, but the curse is ineffective due to the lack of real cruelty behind it. Voldemort suddenly appears but moments later, Bellatrix is subdued by Dumbledore in the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s atrium as he prepares to duel Voldemort. Unable to overcome Dumbledore, Voldemort rescues Bellatrix by [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Apparition and Disapparition|disapparating]] with her.\n\nAt the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Bellatrix attempts to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Snape at [[Spinner's End]], and she is furious to learn that Snape already knows about the plan. Rowling used the conversation between Snape and Bellatrix to imply that Voldemort is still furious at Bellatrix's failure in the previous book.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch2\">{{HP6}}, chapter 2</ref> That conversation also suggests that Bellatrix mistrusts Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Snape surprises Bellatrix by replying to each of her arguments and by agreeing to create an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to assist Draco in his mission to assassinate [[Dumbledore]]. Later in the book, it is mentioned by Snape that Bellatrix had been teaching [[occlumency]] to Draco, in an effort to aid him with his mission. In the film, she and Fenrir Greyback arrive at the Burrow (the Weasley house) and burn it down. Harry and Ginny chase after them, with Bellatrix taunting \"I killed Sirius Black!\". In the film, she is one of several Death Eaters smuggled into Hogwarts using a pair of Vanishing Cabinets to assassinate Dumbledore, though she does not take part in this mission in the book.\n\nBellatrix later becomes the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''. The first chapter of the book implies that Voldemort has yet to forgive Bellatrix for her failure, as he mocks her with the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf [[Remus Lupin]].<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch1\">{{HP7}}, chapter 1</ref> However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to \"prune\" her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]' home; during the attack, Bellatrix devotes much of her energies in efforts to kill Tonks, but is unsuccessful.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch5\">{{HP7}}, chapter 5</ref> In this book, Bellatrix inadvertently reveals she is the guardian of [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup, when the captured Harry, Ron, and Hermione are brought to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse, believing them to have sneaked into her vault at Gringotts due to their possession of [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Godric Gryffindor's sword]], but [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]] appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using polyjuice potion, to gain access to the Lestranges' Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his hunt for the [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]] only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. Rowling stated in an interview that, during the battle, it was Bellatrix who killed Tonks.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], proving more than a match for all three, and nearly hits Ginny with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]].

He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends because Hermione has Muggle parents, Draco was also assigned to kill Dumbledore, but his heart told him otherwise and Snape had to do it for him. Draco, like his family, is part of Slytherin house.\n\n===Lucius Malfoy===\n'''Lucius Malfoy''' is a Death Eater, head of a wealthy [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|pure-blood]] wizarding family and a psychopath; he lives with his wife [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (n\u00e9e Black) and their son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at the [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. Lucius was a [[trustee|school governor]] of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. To maintain his reputation and influence, he makes donations to the Ministry, to charity, and to [[St Mungo's (Harry Potter)|St Mungo's Hospital]]. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.\n\nHe debuts as the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', in which just before Draco and Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants [[Tom Riddle's diary]] in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s [[Potions Class|potions]] cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at [[Flourish & Blotts]], in a plot to use her to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], which would lead to attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students.\n\nLucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it is a [[horcrux]] containing a part of Voldemort's soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, [[Arthur Weasley]], and Dumbledore. Lucius' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school's Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster.\n\nSubsequently, Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free. Upon this, Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm. Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor. Despite his sacking, he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.\n\nLucius next appears in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' during the [[Quidditch]] World Cup, sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Later in that book, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master, who however remains unimpressed. Harry reports Malfoy's declarations to Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him. Thus, the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HP4}}, chapter 36</ref>\n\nDuring the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]] breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.\n\nBy the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear, having lost Voldemort's favour. Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort borrows Lucius' wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest.\n\nDespite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son. He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book. Following Voldemort's death, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco all manage to \"''weasel their way out''\" of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa's aiding Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in 2006, Lucius Malfoy was number 12<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS NUMBER.

There, he was a close friend of [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and [[Remus Lupin]], although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group. With Sirius and James' help, Pettigrew becomes an [[Animagus]], with the ability to transform at will into a [[rat]]. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son, Harry, is Voldemort's target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily's death (and ironically, Voldemort's near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders. Pettigrew is (seemingly posthumously) awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as [[Percy Weasley]]'s pet, and then as [[Ron Weasley]]'s. In this form (named \"Scabbers\" by the family), he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off.\n\nAlthough Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is the main antagonist. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the ''Daily Prophet'' newspaper, Sirius recognises Pettigrew's Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down. The two confront each other in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his treachery, claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, to prove Sirius' innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry's actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt.\n\nPettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of [[Albania]] and helping him to return to a feeble baby's body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named [[Bertha Jorkins]], who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as \"Wormtail\" hereafter) assists [[#Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] in overpowering [[Mad-Eye Moody]], setting up the events in the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Wormtail murders [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] on Voldemort's orders, and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as one of the ingredients. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Wormtail's missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Wormtail's fortunes remain low; in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' Snape treats him as a servant, and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Wormtail checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Wormtail begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Wormtail hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity. Harry Potter thinks of him and describes it as having regrets.\n\nPettigrew is portrayed by [[Timothy Spall]] as an adult, and by [[Charles Hughes (actor)|Charles Hughes]] as a teenager in the films. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'', Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed. He only appears in a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\n[[IGN]]'s Joe Utichi also listed him as his 10th top ''Harry Potter'' character.<ref name=\"Joe Top\" />\n\n=== Severus Snape ===\n{{Main|Severus Snape}}\n'''Severus Snape''' is characterised as a person of considerable complexity, whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish. In the first novel of the series, Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and is built up to be the primary [[antagonist]] until the final chapters. As the series progresses, Snape's portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex, pivotal character of moral ambiguity, whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end. Snape is, as revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', actually a spy in Voldemort's ranks for Dumbledore.\n\n=== Corban Yaxley ===\n'''Corban'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pottermore Presents - Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> '''Yaxley''' is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort's spies in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of [[Charity Burbage]], and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry's departure from the Dursleys', but [[John Dawlish]], an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information. Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the Imperius Curse upon [[Pius Thicknesse]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.\n\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin's locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists [[Dolores Umbridge]] in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters, but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to.\n\nHe participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with [[Professor Flitwick]] and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time. When the battle resumes, he is defeated by [[Fred and George Weasley|George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]].\n\n[[Peter Mullan]] plays Yaxley in the film adaptation of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{hpw|Death Eaters}}\n* [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/death_eaters.html The Harry Potter Lexicon item] on Death Eaters\n* [http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/pronunciation/play.htm How to pronounce Bellatrix's name] at the official [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613095313/http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/pottercast/episode/show/52 PotterCast #40: Bag of 'trix] \u2013 A podcast debating Bellatrix's role in the series\n* [http://slate.com/id/2123105 When Harry Met Osama.

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname ''[[FitzClarence]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nDorothea (often called '''Dorothy''' or '''Dora''') Bland was born near [[Waterford]] City in [[Ireland]] on 22 November 1761<ref> \"Dorothea Jordan\", Encyclopeadia Britannica Online. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dorothea-Jordan Retrieved 11th February, 2020.</ref>, and was baptised at [[St Martin in the Fields]], Middlesex, on 5 December of that year.<ref name =\"Camp\">[http://anthonyjcamp.com/page13.htm Anthony J.

Dora became a famous actress and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage.\n\n\n==Theatrical career ==\nThe historical record of Jordan's first stage appearance is not clear.

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular [[breeches role]]s. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. She took the offer and performed for Wilkinson's company for a final time on 9 September 1785 before departing to London with her mother, two-year-old daughter and sister Hester.  \n\nThough no specific dates can be sourced, Dora is believed to have performed the role of Lady Teazle in Sheridan's [[The School for Scandal]] before she arrived in London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piozzi letters : correspondence of Hester Lynch Piozzi, 1784-1821 (formerly Mrs. Thrale)|last=Piozzi|first= Hester Lynch|date=|publisher=University of Delaware Press|others=Bloom, Edward A.

She lived frugally but always paid her rent on time. Not having been summoned back to England, she moved to Versailles by the end of the year. Soon after, she moved to [[Saint-Cloud]], near Paris. It is suggested that she made these last two moves to be closer to her son Frederick, who was stationed in Paris as part of the British Army. While in France, she was defrauded by eldest daughter, Frances and son-in-law, Thomas Alsop after they accumulated large sums of debt in her name.

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular [[breeches role]]s. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].
