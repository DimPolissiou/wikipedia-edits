The short-lived revolution was overthrown by the American Troops and a battle nearly destroyed the town in 1901, killing [[Municipal president|Presidente]] Benito Ceniza.{{sfn|Mojares|1999}}\n\nMandaue was a semi-autonomous functioning town. Semi-autonomous as it was still under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Despite having been developed and organized by the Spaniards through-out the ages and its population increasing as the years gone by, the Spaniards did not make an initiative to elevate the town into an independent municipality. It was only after the death of Presidente Ceniza and the establishment of American Rule in Mandaue that the dream of becoming an independent municipality came true. In 1901, Mandaue became an independent municipality.<ref>https://www.mandauecity.gov.ph/</ref>\n\nMandaue became independent from being an American Commonwealth and a Japanese garrison on July 4, 1946 along with the entire nation.

This may have started off as a mission village (which included present day [[Consolacion]], [[Liloan, Cebu|Liloan]] and [[Poro, Cebu|Poro]]) serving as a bulwark for the church in the northern Cebu and was managed by the Jesuit in 1638 then a century later by the Recollects.<ref name=\"Mandaue City\">{{cite web | url =http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/r7_mandaue.html| title = Mandaue| work = admu.edu.ph| publisher = admu.edu.ph}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Philippine revolution]] in 1898 gave the town a new form of administration in accordance with the organic decree of the Central Revolutionary Government. The short-lived revolution was overthrown by the American Troops and a battle nearly destroyed the town in 1901, killing [[Municipal president|Presidente]] Benito Ceniza.{{sfn|Mojares|1999}}\n\nMandaue was a semi-autonomous functioning town. Semi-autonomous as it was still under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Despite having been developed and organized by the Spaniards through-out the ages and its population increasing as the years gone by, the Spaniards did not make an initiative to elevate the town into an independent municipality. It was only after the death of Presidente Ceniza and the establishment of American Rule in Mandaue that the dream of becoming an independent municipality came true. In 1901, Mandaue became an independent municipality.<ref>https://www.mandauecity.gov.ph/</ref>\n\nMandaue became independent from being an American Commonwealth and a Japanese garrison on July 4, 1946 along with the entire nation.

It too added a number of new datasets and features, including Ancient Literature cross-references, Cultural Concepts, [[Biblical manuscript|original manuscript]] images, multimedia and the new Factbook that attempted to integrate the increasing number of databases to an even greater extent than was possible in Logos 5. Logos 6 also integrates with the Send to [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\n''Logos Bible Software 7'' was released towards the end of August 2016. Features added with this full version include, Sermon Editor, Course Tool, Figurative Language (interactive), Hebrew Grammatical Constructions, Longacre Genre Analysis, Sentence Types of the New Testament Dataset, Quickstart Layouts, Speech Acts, An Empty Tomb (interactive), Exploring Biblical Manuscripts.\n\n''Logos Bible Software 8'' was released at the end of October 2018.\n\n=== Mobile versions ===\nAn [[iPhone]] [[mobile application|app]] was released alongside Logos 4 in November 2009. It allows users to access most of their Logos resources on the iPhone, with basic search and study features. Resources can be accessed over the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], or downloaded onto the device for offline access. Native [[iPad]] support was added with version 1.4 in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thislamp.com/posts/2010/4/18/review-logos-bible-software-for-ipad-v-14.html|title = Review: Logos Bible Software for iPad v. 1.4|date = 18 April 2010|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = This Lamp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 2.0 (January 2012) added notes, highlights and inline footnotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/44466.aspx|title = Logos for iOS 2.0.1 Release Notes|date = 27 January 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 3.0 (August 2012) added reading plans and community notes,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/53757.aspx|title = iOS Reader Suite 3.0.0 Release Notes|date = 29 August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and version 4.0 a new [[User interface|UI]] updated for [[iOS 7]]. A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders.

It too added a number of new datasets and features, including Ancient Literature cross-references, Cultural Concepts, [[Biblical manuscript|original manuscript]] images, multimedia and the new Factbook that attempted to integrate the increasing number of databases to an even greater extent than was possible in Logos 5. Logos 6 also integrates with the Send to [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\n''Logos Bible Software 7'' was released towards the end of August 2016.

It allows users to access most of their Logos resources on the iPhone, with basic search and study features. Resources can be accessed over the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], or downloaded onto the device for offline access.

A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders.

It consists of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]], a [[corrin]], with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]] and is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes that use it as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it. In [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], these enzymes include [[methionine synthase]], [[ribonucleotide reductase]], glutamate and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]s, [[ethanolamine ammonia-lyase]], and [[diol]] [[dehydratase]].<ref name=\"pmid12869542\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305837200 |doi-access = free |title=Comparative Genomics of the Vitamin B12 Metabolism and Regulation in Prokaryotes |year=2003 |last1=Rodionov |first1=Dmitry A. |last2=Vitreschak |first2=Alexey G. |last3=Mironov |first3=Andrey A. |last4=Gelfand |first4=Mikhail S. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=42 |pages=41148\u201341159 |pmid=12869542 }}</ref> In certain mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]].<ref name=\"pmid17163662\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cb6001174   |title=B12 Trafficking in Mammals: A Case for Coenzyme Escort Service |year=2006 |last1=Banerjee |first1=Ruma |journal=ACS Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013159 |pmid=17163662 }}</ref> In humans, it plays essential roles in [[folate]] metabolism and in the synthesis of the [[citric acid cycle]] intermediate, [[succinyl-CoA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12|title=Vitamin B12 |publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of cobalamin biosynthesis==\nThere are at least two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in [[bacterium|bacteria]]:<ref name=\"pmid11153269\">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/s0083-6729(01)61009-4 |chapter=Multiple biosynthetic pathways for vitamin B12: Variations on a central theme |title=Cofactor Biosynthesis |series=Vitamins & Hormones |year=2001 |last1=Roessner |first1=Charles A. |last2=Santander |first2=Patricio J. |last3=Scott |first3=A.Ian |volume=61 |pages=267\u2013297 |pmid=11153269 |isbn=9780127098616 }}</ref>\n{|\n|[[File:Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12.jpg|thumb |left|Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12 from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in bacteria and archaea]]\n|[[File:Vitamin B12.svg|thumb|upright=2|Vitamin B12 (as cyano cobalamin) and its parent cobyric acid]]\n|}\n*[[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] pathway that requires [[oxygen]] and in which cobalt is inserted late in the pathway;<ref name=\"pmid16042605\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0330815  |title=Aerobic synthesis of vitamin B12: Ring contraction and cobalt chelation |year=2005 |last1=Heldt |first1=D. |last2=Lawrence |first2=A.D. |last3=Lindenmeyer |first3=M. |last4=Deery |first4=E. |last5=Heathcote |first5=P. |last6=Rigby |first6=S.E. |last7=Warren |first7=M.J. |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=815\u2013819 |pmid=16042605 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/068c6dc246314fffbb8137925911c32230d7b9c0 }}</ref><ref name=\"aerobic pathway\" >{{cite web |url=https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P381-PWY |title=Pathway: adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis II (aerobic) |author=R.

Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is the largest and most structurally complex [[vitamin]].

Nonstop have achieved notable success with their first album, ''Nonstop'', and especially with their first hit [[single (music)|single]] \"Ao Limite Eu Vou\".\n\n[[Songwriter]] and [[record producer|producer]], Eliot Kennedy - who had previously worked with bands such as [[Spice Girls]] and [[Take That]] - once said \"they are probably the best group I have worked with. Their voices are so good!\"\n\n==Formation==\nIn 2001 the dream catcher reality-show ''[[Popstars]]'' was launched in Portugal by the television station [[SIC (Portugal)|SIC]] with the aim of creating a five-piece [[girl group|girl band]].\n\nMore than one thousand and two hundred girls attended auditions in the cities of [[Porto]], [[Algarve]] and [[Lisbon]], hoping for a place in the group.\n\nWhile running the auditions in Algarve, Liliana Almeida wasn't accept to the casting for not being yet eighteen; she would eventually go to Lisbon for the last day of auditions and make it to the second round (comically, that day was the day of her eighteenth birthday).\n\nAs the contestants were eliminated the line-up for the newest Portuguese girl group was revealed. By April 4 the five finalists, Andrea Soares, Ana Rita Reis, F\u00e1tima Sousa, K\u00e1tia Moreira, and Liliana Almeida were known as the formal winners of the contest. Nonstop was born.\n\n==Subsequent career==\nNonstop's first single, \"Ao Limite Eu Vou\" was produced by the Steelworks producing team; Tim Woodcock and Eliot Kennedy. The song became one of the biggest hits that summer, going #1 on the national music charts, easily reaching gold status.\n\nAlso produced by Steelworks, Nonstop's self-titled debut album was released on July 16, 2001. The album sold over 30,000 copies and went gold.\n\nAlong with their success in Portugal came the interest from other countries in their music, such as Canada, [[Belgium]], and [[South Africa]].\n\nThis same interest bought back to Portugal the Steelworks duo so that some of the album's songs could be recorded in their English versions.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Basta Um Sorriso\" was chosen to be the girl band\u2019s second single, and was revealed to be the group's second hit. [[Miguel Gaud\u00eancio]], who had directed the band's first music video, was planning to make the first ever Portuguese 3D music video for \"Basta Um Sorriso\", though it was never finished. Some sponsors cut the funds, the record company also didn't back up the music video, which didn't help the situation.\n\nSix months after the group's formation, in January, 2002, F\u00e1tima announced she was leaving the band, justifying her departure for being homesick. Though the loss of one member the four remaining girls decided to continue as a quartet.\n\nNonstop's promotion on their first album continued with the release of its third single \"N\u00e3o H\u00e1 Nada Em Mim\", constantly appearing on various TV shows and in magazines (not to mention their daily updated web site). Also, the song \"Olhar P'ra Ti (S\u00f3 Para Ti)\" was chosen to become part of a Portuguese soap opera's, \"F\u00faria de Viver\", original soundtrack, increasing their popularity. Not to mention their participation, as special guests, on \"Uma Aventura...\".\n\nWhile touring Portugal from north to south, the band\u2014along with its management, NZ Produ\u00e7\u00f5es\u2014decided to bring in something new to their concerts. This took the girls back to studio recording to do a cover of the [[Patti LaBelle]] song, \"[[Lady Marmalade]]\".\n\nAfterwards, Nonstop broke with NZ Produ\u00e7\u00f5es and joined Lemon.\n\nThen, in 2004, three years after releasing their debut album, Nonstop announced their comeback.\n\nTheir second album, entitled \"Tudo Vai Mudar\", named after its first single \"E Tudo Vai Mudar\", was released on May 5 of that year. As with \"Nonstop\", \"Tudo Vai Mudar\" also featured the production and songwriting work of Steelworks. National producers as AC Firmino and Augusto Armada (better known as Boss AC and Gutto); Carlos Juvantes and Gon\u00e7alo Pereira also gave their contribution to the album.\n\nThe album's promotion started much before its release. \"E Tudo Vai Mudar\" was very well received by the media, being strongly promoted by the national radios and [[MTV]] Portugal.\n\nNonstop also attended various TV Shows, usually singing live. They also guest-starred on national TV\u2019s prime time series leader, \"Inspector Max\".\n\nThe girls' fifth single, \"Play-back\", a cover of Carlos Pai\u00e3o's hit in the 80's, was released on July 17, 2004 premiering on SIC's Sunday primetime talk-show, \"HermanSIC\", where the girls, after participating in a little comedy sketch with the show\u2019s host, once again, performed live.\n\nThe \"Tudo Vai Mudar Tour\" took the girls travelling to countries such as Canada and France. Nonstop was also the band chosen to open [[Boyzone|ex-Boyzone\u2019s]] [[Ronan Keating]] concert in Portugal.\n\nThen, in 2005, Rita Reis was featured in two albums: Boss AC\u2019s ''Ritmo, Amor e Palavras'', in the song \"\u00c9s mais que uma mulher\"; and in Gutto\u2019s ''Chokolate'', the duet ''Importante''. Rita, Andrea and Liliana also made an appearance on Gutto\u2019s video for ''S\u00f3 Quero Dan\u00e7ar'' (\"I Just Want To Dance\").\n\nLater that month, Nonstop were invited to do a cover of [[Boney M]]'s, ''Daddy Cool'' for RTP\u2019s contest special, for 19 March ''(father\u2019s day)''; ''Um, Dois, Tr\u00eas'' (1, 2, 3) \u2019.\n\nLater that year, in April, Nonstop celebrated their fourth anniversary with a private party in one of Lisbon's most famous pubs, '''W'''. The party was later reported on SIC\u2019s, ''Ext\u00e2se''.\n\nStill in 2005, Nonstop started to promote the ballad; \"Assim Como \u00c9s\", produced by AC and Gutto, and ''E Tudo Vai Mudar\u2019s'' English, and original version ''Sooner Or Later''.\n\nWith the start of the New Year, 2006 also became the start of a new era for Nonstop.\n\nInvited by the Portuguese song producer, Elvis Veiguinha, to participate in ''RTP\u2019s Song Festival Contest 2006'', Nonstop jumped back into studio to record ''Coisas de Nada'', originally entitled ''Vem Dan\u00e7ar''.\n\nRTP\u2019s Song Festival Contest 2006 took place on 10 March \u2013 Liliana\u2019s birthday \u2013 at Lisbon\u2019s ''Centro de Congressos''. After a tie with V\u00e2nia Oliveira\u2019s song, ''Sei Quem Sou (Portugal)'', the jury decided that ''Coisas de Nada'' would represent Portugal at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] semi-final in Athens, making Nonstop the official winners of 2006 national contest. However, Nonstop failed to make the final of the contest, coming in 19th place in the semi-finals.\n\nIn February 2007, a collaboration between Portuguese rapper Gutto and group member Liliana has been released. ''Deixa Ferver'' receives heavy rotation on MTV Portugal and radio stations.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"28\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Year'''\n! width=\"205\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Title'''\n! width=\"150\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Certifications'''\n|-\n! width=\"46\"| <small>Portuguese Album Chart</small>\n|- \n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2001\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Nonstop''\n|align=\"center\"| Gold\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|<small>'''N/A'''</small>\n|- \n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2004\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|<small>'''N/A'''</small>\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"24\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! align=\"center\" width=\"230\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! align=\"center\" width=\"130\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|-\n! width=\"46\"| <small>Portuguese Singles Chart</small>\n|- \n| 2001\n| Ao Limite Eu Vou\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2001\n| Basta Um Sorriso\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2002\n| N\u00e3o H\u00e1 Nada Em Mim\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2004\n| E Tudo Vai Mudar\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2004\n| Play-Back\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2005\n| Assim Como \u00c9s\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2006\n| Coisas de Nada\n| ''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]]''\n|}\n\n===Featured singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

Not to mention their participation, as special guests, on \"Uma Aventura...\".\n\nWhile touring Portugal from north to south, the band\u2014along with its management, NZ Produ\u00e7\u00f5es\u2014decided to bring in something new to their concerts. This took the girls back to studio recording to do a cover of the [[Patti LaBelle]] song, \"[[Lady Marmalade]]\".\n\nAfterwards, Nonstop broke with NZ Produ\u00e7\u00f5es and joined Lemon.\n\nThen, in 2004, three years after releasing their debut album, Nonstop announced their comeback.\n\nTheir second album, entitled \"Tudo Vai Mudar\", named after its first single \"E Tudo Vai Mudar\", was released on May 5 of that year. As with \"Nonstop\", \"Tudo Vai Mudar\" also featured the production and songwriting work of Steelworks. National producers as AC Firmino and Augusto Armada (better known as Boss AC and Gutto); Carlos Juvantes and Gon\u00e7alo Pereira also gave their contribution to the album.\n\nThe album's promotion started much before its release. \"E Tudo Vai Mudar\" was very well received by the media, being strongly promoted by the national radios and [[MTV]] Portugal.\n\nNonstop also attended various TV Shows, usually singing live. They also guest-starred on national TV\u2019s prime time series leader, \"Inspector Max\".\n\nThe girls' fifth single, \"Play-back\", a cover of Carlos Pai\u00e3o's hit in the 80's, was released on July 17, 2004 premiering on SIC's Sunday primetime talk-show, \"HermanSIC\", where the girls, after participating in a little comedy sketch with the show\u2019s host, once again, performed live.\n\nThe \"Tudo Vai Mudar Tour\" took the girls travelling to countries such as Canada and France. Nonstop was also the band chosen to open [[Boyzone|ex-Boyzone\u2019s]] [[Ronan Keating]] concert in Portugal.\n\nThen, in 2005, Rita Reis was featured in two albums: Boss AC\u2019s ''Ritmo, Amor e Palavras'', in the song \"\u00c9s mais que uma mulher\"; and in Gutto\u2019s ''Chokolate'', the duet ''Importante''. Rita, Andrea and Liliana also made an appearance on Gutto\u2019s video for ''S\u00f3 Quero Dan\u00e7ar'' (\"I Just Want To Dance\").\n\nLater that month, Nonstop were invited to do a cover of [[Boney M]]\u2019s, ''Daddy Cool'' for RTP\u2019s contest special, for 19 March ''(father\u2019s day)''; ''Um, Dois, Tr\u00eas'' (1, 2, 3) \u2019.\n\nLater that year, in April, Nonstop celebrated their fourth anniversary with a private party in one of Lisbon's most famous pubs, '''W'''. The party was latter reported on SIC\u2019s, ''Ext\u00e2se''.\n\nStill in 2005, Nonstop started to promote the ballad; \"Assim Como \u00c9s\", produced by AC and Gutto, and ''E Tudo Vai Mudar\u2019s'' English, and original version ''Sooner Or Later''.\n\nWith the start of the New Year, 2006 also became the start of a new era for Nonstop.\n\nInvited by the Portuguese song producer, Elvis Veiguinha, to participate in ''RTP\u2019s Song Festival Contest 2006'', Nonstop jumped back into studio to record ''Coisas de Nada'', originally entitled ''Vem Dan\u00e7ar''.\n\nRTP\u2019s Song Festival Contest 2006 took place on 10 March \u2013 Liliana\u2019s birthday \u2013 at Lisbon\u2019s ''Centro de Congressos''. After a tie with V\u00e2nia Oliveira\u2019s song, ''Sei Quem Sou (Portugal)'', the jury decided that ''Coisas de Nada'' would represent Portugal at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] semi-final in Athens, making Nonstop the official winners of 2006 national contest. However, Nonstop failed to make the final of the contest, coming in 19th place in the semi-finals.\n\nIn February 2007, a collaboration between Portuguese rapper Gutto and group member Liliana has been released. ''Deixa Ferver'' receives heavy rotation on MTV Portugal and radio stations.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"28\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Year'''\n! width=\"205\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Title'''\n! width=\"150\" rowspan=\"2\"| '''Certifications'''\n|-\n! width=\"46\"| <small>Portuguese Album Chart</small>\n|- \n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2001\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Nonstop''\n|align=\"center\"| Gold\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|<small>'''N/A'''</small>\n|- \n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2004\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|<small>'''N/A'''</small>\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"24\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! align=\"center\" width=\"230\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! align=\"center\" width=\"130\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|-\n! width=\"46\"| <small>Portuguese Singles Chart</small>\n|- \n| 2001\n| Ao Limite Eu Vou\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2001\n| Basta Um Sorriso\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2002\n| N\u00e3o H\u00e1 Nada Em Mim\n| ''Nonstop''\n|- \n| 2004\n| E Tudo Vai Mudar\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2004\n| Play-Back\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2005\n| Assim Como \u00c9s\n| ''Tudo Vai Mudar''\n|- \n| 2006\n| Coisas de Nada\n| ''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]]''\n|}\n\n===Featured singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

This has often caused the [[ventral scales]] to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nThe only [[genus]] that has retained the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, ''[[Laticauda]]'', with only five species. These snakes are considered to be more primitive, as they still spend much of their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/> ''Laticauda'' species are also the only sea snakes with [[internasal scales]], i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.<ref name=\"RAS-FAO\"/>\n\nSince a snake's tongue can fulfill its olfactory function more easily under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch in the middle of the [[rostral scale]].<ref name=\"P&G77\"/> The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nMost species of the sea snakes are able to respire through the top of their skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but experiments with the black-and-yellow sea snake, ''[[Pelamis platura]]'' (a [[pelagic]] species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.<ref name=\"C&L04\">Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004.

This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved to allow them to expel salt with their tongue action.<ref name=\"P&G77\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nScalation among sea snakes is highly variable. As opposed to terrestrial snake species that have imbricate scales to protect against abrasion, the scales of most pelagic sea snakes do not overlap. Reef-dwelling species, such as ''[[Aipysurus]]'', do have imbricate scales to protect against the sharp coral. The scales themselves may be smooth, [[keeled scales|keeled]], spiny, or granular, the latter often looking like warts.

For example, in 1932, a steamer in the [[Strait of Malacca]], off the coast of [[Malaysia]], reported sighting \"millions\" of ''[[Astrotia stokesii]]'', a relative of ''Pelamis''; these reportedly formed a line of snakes {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=\"NS90\"/> The cause of this phenomenon is unknown, although it likely has to do with reproduction.<ref name=\"P&G77\"/> They can sometimes be seen swimming in schools of 900 snakes (wohoah) and many dead specimens have been found on beaches after typhoons.<ref name=\"Dit33\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\nThey feed on small fish and occasionally young octopus.

Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby [[lymph node]]s affected. The most important symptoms are [[rhabdomyolysis]] (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. The venom is very slow acting and symptoms that happen from little as 30&nbsp;minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and [[trismus]], which is similar to [[tetanus]], is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other [[Elapidae|elapid]] envenomations, a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.<ref name=\"War-C&L04\">Warrell DA. 2004.

Eventually, as  just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids became clear, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if ''Laticauda'' is included in the Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the [[phylogenetic]] relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.<ref name=\"ITIS\"/><ref name=\"NRDB\"/><ref name=\"Dit33\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n{{-}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Available food supply limits the number of species that can be kept in captivity, since some have diets that are too specialized. Also, some species appear intolerant of handling, or even being removed from the water.  Regarding their requirements in captivity, the ''[[Laticauda]]'' species need to be able to exit the water somewhere  at about 29&nbsp;\u00b0C, along with a submerged shelter. Species that have done relatively well in captivity include the ringed sea snake, ''[[Hydrophis cyanocinctus]]'', which feeds on [[fish]] and [[eel]]s in particular. ''[[Pelamis platurus]]'' has done especially well in captivity, accepting small fish, including [[goldfish]]. However, care has to be taken to house them in round or oval tanks, or in rectangular tanks with corners that are well-rounded, to prevent the snakes from damaging their snouts by swimming into the sides.<ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\n==Conservation status==\nMost sea snakes are not on the [[CITES]] protection lists,<ref name=\"RAS-FAO\"/><ref name=\"CITES\">[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/isdb/CITES/Taxonomy/tax-order-result.cfm?source=animals&RequestTimeout=1200&displaylanguage=eng&Order=141 Serpentes] at [http://www.cites.org/ CITES].

This has often caused the [[ventral scales]] to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nThe only [[genus]] that has retained the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, ''[[Laticauda]]'', with only five species. These snakes are considered to be more primitive, as they still spend much of their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/> ''Laticauda'' species are also the only sea snakes with [[internasal scales]], i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.<ref name=\"RAS-FAO\"/>\n\nSince a snake's tongue can fulfill its olfactory function more easily under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch in the middle of the [[rostral scale]].<ref name=\"P&G77\"/> The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nMost species of the sea snakes are able to respire through the top of their skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but experiments with the black-and-yellow sea snake, ''[[Pelamis platura]]'' (a [[pelagic]] species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.<ref name=\"C&L04\">Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004.

This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved to allow them to expel salt with their tongue action.<ref name=\"P&G77\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n\nScalation among sea snakes is highly variable. As opposed to terrestrial snake species that have imbricate scales to protect against abrasion, the scales of most pelagic sea snakes do not overlap. Reef-dwelling species, such as ''[[Aipysurus]]'', do have imbricate scales to protect against the sharp coral. The scales themselves may be smooth, [[keeled scales|keeled]], spiny, or granular, the latter often looking like warts.

Others, such as ''Laticauda'' spp., use their venom for prey immobilization. Sea snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded, usually without getting bitten, when the snakes frequently become entangled in fishing nets.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/> Species reported as much more aggressive include ''[[Aipysurus laevis]]'', ''[[Astrotia stokesii]]'', ''[[Enhydrina schistosa]]'', ''[[Enhydrina zweifeli]]'', and ''[[Hydrophis ornatus]]''.<ref name=\"RAS-FAO\"/>\n\n[[File:Aipysurus laevis.jpg|thumb|Olive sea snake, ''[[Aipysurus laevis]]'']]\nOn land, their movements become very erratic.

In the morning, and sometimes late in the afternoon, they can be seen at the surface basking in the sunlight, and they dive when disturbed.<ref name=\"Sti74\"/> They have been reported swimming at depths over {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and can remain submerged for as long as a few hours, possibly depending on temperature and degree of activity.<ref name=\"Fic82\"/><ref name=\"USN91\"/>\n\nSea snakes have been sighted in huge numbers.

Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby [[lymph node]]s affected. The most important symptoms are [[rhabdomyolysis]] (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. The venom is very slow acting and symptoms that happen from little as 30&nbsp;minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and [[trismus]], which is similar to [[tetanus]], is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other [[Elapidae|elapid]] envenomations, a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] and paralysis of voluntary muscles.

Eventually, as  just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids became clear, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if ''Laticauda'' is included in the Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the [[phylogenetic]] relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.<ref name=\"ITIS\"/><ref name=\"NRDB\"/><ref name=\"Dit33\"/><ref name=\"Meh87\"/>\n{{-}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Ditmars (1933) described them as nervous and delicate captives that usually refuse to eat, preferring only to hide in the darkest corner of the tank.<ref name=\"Dit33\"/> Over 50&nbsp;years later, Mehrtens (1987) wrote, although they were rarely displayed in Western zoological parks, some species were regularly on display in Japanese aquariums. Available food supply limits the number of species that can be kept in captivity, since some have diets that are too specialized. Also, some species appear intolerant of handling, or even being removed from the water.  Regarding their requirements in captivity, the ''[[Laticauda]]'' species need to be able to exit the water somewhere  at about 29&nbsp;\u00b0C, along with a submerged shelter. Species that have done relatively well in captivity include the ringed sea snake, ''[[Hydrophis cyanocinctus]]'', which feeds on [[fish]] and [[eel]]s in particular. ''[[Pelamis platurus]]'' has done especially well in captivity, accepting small fish, including [[goldfish]].

About two-thirds of those employees are classified as \u201ctech workers,\u201d which includes programmers, developers, etc. With 8% of the total workforce employed in tech, the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor also has a similar talent density to Silicon Valley and a much greater density than New York, Boston or Seattle. <ref>https://blog.waterlooedc.ca/what-is-toronto-waterloo-corridor</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to several [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Toronto]] and [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Other universities in the region include [[Brock University]] in St. Catherines, [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, [[York University]], [[OCAD University]], [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] in Oshawa, [[Ryerson University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in Waterloo, and [[Universit\u00e9 de l'Ontario fran\u00e7ais]] in downtown Toronto.\n\nPublic primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by [[school boards]], largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.\n\n==Attractions==\n{{See also|Attractions in Toronto}}\n[[File:Caribana 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] is an annual cultural festival held in the City of Toronto.]]\nFormerly the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|tallest freestanding structure on land in the world]], the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe.\n\nThe city is home to several [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (which is North America's busiest shopping mall),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Shopping Centre Study|url=http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/RCCCanadianShoppingCenterStudyFINAL.pdf|publisher=[[Retail Council of Canada]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=December 2016}}</ref> [[Fairview Mall]], [[Scarborough Town Centre]], and [[Sherway Gardens]].

The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]].

The automotive industry is a major sector of the Golden Horseshoe's economy.]]\nCities including Hamilton, Oshawa, Oakville, Whitby and Kitchener all contain major large-scale industrial production facilities, Hamilton being dominated by the [[Steel#Steel industry|steel industry]] and Oakville and Oshawa primarily in the [[automotive industry]]. Other significant automotive-production facilities also exist in [[Brampton]], and [[St. Catharines]]. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario's goods.\n\nThe [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Port of Hamilton]] and the [[PortsToronto|Port of Toronto]] are the two largest [[Port#Seaport|seaports]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[Welland Canal]] system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, [[Vaughan]] and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient in the economy. \n[[File:Wine grapes nearing harvest in Ontario-also example of trellis wire.jpg|thumb|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] is Canada's largest wine growing region and a major producer of [[Ontario wine]].]]\nNiagara Falls has one of the world's largest per-capita tourist economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its majestic waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. The winemaking and fruit growing industries of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] produce award-winning wines, which are beginning to attract attention around the world, in particular, the [[ice wine]] for which the region is known.\n\nAs of 2014, sectors such as [[information technology]], health care, Agtech, tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth in the Golden Horseshoe. The suburban cities within [[Greater Toronto]], such as [[Brampton]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Waterloo Region]] and [[Mississauga]], are emerging as hubs for technology and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Business/economic-development/Key-Sectors/Pages/Innovation-and-Technology.aspx|title=Innovation & Technology|website=www.brampton.ca}}</ref> \n\nSince 2015, the Toronto-Waterloo Region Corridor is a hub for high-growth companies developing breakthrough discoveries. <ref>https://thecorridor.ca</ref> \n\nThe Toronto-Waterloo Corridor is the largest tech cluster in North America outside of Silicon Valley. The area is home to more than 15,000 tech companies, including 5,000+ startups, and nearly 300,000 employees in high-tech industries. About two-thirds of those employees are classified as \u201ctech workers,\u201d which includes programmers, developers, etc. With 8% of the total workforce employed in tech, the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor also has a similar talent density to Silicon Valley and a much greater density than New York, Boston or Seattle. <ref>https://blog.waterlooedc.ca/what-is-toronto-waterloo-corridor</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to several [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Toronto]] and [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Other universities in the region include [[Brock University]] in St. Catherines, [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, [[York University]], [[OCAD University]], [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] in Oshawa, [[Ryerson University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in Waterloo, and [[Universit\u00e9 de l'Ontario fran\u00e7ais]] in downtown Toronto.\n\nPublic primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by [[school boards]], largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.\n\n==Attractions==\n{{See also|Attractions in Toronto}}\n[[File:Caribana 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] is an annual cultural festival held in the City of Toronto.]]\nFormerly the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|tallest freestanding structure on land in the world]], the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe.\n\nThe city is home to several [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (which is North America's busiest shopping mall),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Shopping Centre Study|url=http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/RCCCanadianShoppingCenterStudyFINAL.pdf|publisher=[[Retail Council of Canada]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=December 2016}}</ref> [[Fairview Mall]], [[Scarborough Town Centre]], and [[Sherway Gardens]].

The falls is a part of the [[Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve]], which runs across the western portion of the Golden Horseshoe.]]\nThe [[Niagara Escarpment]], a world biosphere as designated by the United Nations, runs from the north at Bruce Peninsula and then east through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]].

[[Canada's Wonderland]], run by [[Cedar Fair]] in Vaughan, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Vaughan Mills, is the largest and most attended theme park in Canada, as well as the most attended seasonal theme park in North America. Other theme parks include [[Wet'n'Wild Toronto]] (formerly Wild Water Kingdom) in [[Brampton]], [[African Lion Safari]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], and [[Marineland of Canada|Marineland]] in Niagara Falls.

In June 1904 the publication was moved to the small town of [[Hancock, Michigan|Hancock]], located in the sparsely populated [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. The paper remained in that location for a decade before moving to the comparative metropolis of [[Superior, Wisconsin]], a virtual twin city of [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. From its earliest days, ''Ty\u00f6mies'' was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] publication, significantly more radical than its East Coast counterpart established in January 1905, ''Raivaaja'' (The Pioneer).<ref name=\"Dirk1-234\">Auvo Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pp. 234-235.</ref> The paper briefly published an English-language paper called ''Wage Slave,'' and was the source of a number of annual magazines in the Finnish language.<ref name=\"Dirk1-234\" /> During its Communist Party phase, which began in about 1920, the circulation of the daily fluctuated in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 copies, declining to around 5,000 in 1950, at which time it was consolidated with the CPUSA's East Coast Finnish-language newspaper, ''Eteenp\u00e4in,'' to form ''Ty\u00f6mies-Eteenp\u00e4in'' (see below).\n* ''[[Toveri]]'' (The Comrade) (December 1907 \u2013 February 1931) \u2014 ''Toveri'' hailed from the isolated coastal town of [[Astoria, Oregon]], one of two major radical publications produced there by the tightly knit community of \"Red Finns\" there. The decision of the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] to divide the itself into three districts gave impetus to Finnish-American socialists to launch a newspaper of their own to serve as the voice of the Federation's Western District. In June 1907 a referendum of the Finnish Socialist locals of the West decided to establish a paper for the district and a temporary board of directors was established in Astoria.<ref name=\"Hum40\">Paul George Hummasti, Finnish Radicals in Astoria, Oregon, 1904-1940: A Study in Immigrant Socialism.

When half of this amount was sold by October, the new holding company, the Western Workmen's Co-operative Publishing Company, was cleared to begin operations.<ref name=\"Hum40\" /> The first issue of the new paper, named ''[[Toveri]]'' (\"The Comrade\") appeared on December 7, 1907, under the editorship of Aku Rissanen, formerly on the editorial staff of the Massachusetts Finnish-language socialist newspaper, ''Raivaaja.''<ref>Hummasti, ''Finnish Radicals in Astoria, Oregon, 1904-1940,'' pg. 41.</ref> Although planned as a [[bi-weekly]], the paper was impacted by an emerging economic crisis and appeared only irregularly during its first year.<ref name=\"Hum42\">Hummasti, ''Finnish Radicals in Astoria, Oregon, 1904-1940,'' pg. 42.</ref> The paper moved to daily status in 1912.<ref name=\"Hum42\" /> In 1920, the paper's editorial line moved from the Socialist Party camp to a position favoring revolutionary socialism, and the paper soon evolved into a Communist Party organ, which it followed up to its demise.<ref name=\"Dirk1-231\">Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pp. 231-232.</ref> ''Toveri'' generally consisted of six pages and included sections for farmers and women, as well as material in English, and it was supported by local advertisers.<ref name=\"Dirk1-231\" /> The printing presses of ''Toveri'' were shipped to Soviet [[Karelia]] following the paper's closure in 1931.<ref name=\"Dirk1-231\" />\n* ''[[Toveritar]]'' (The Woman Comrade) (July 1911 \u2013 September 1930) \u2014 In 1911 the Western District convention of the Finnish Socialist Federation reversed its previous policy and urged its locals to form special women's committees and  branches for their female members, with a view to increasing the party's influence among women, who were beginning to gain the [[woman suffrage|right to vote]] throughout the West.<ref>Hummasti, ''Finnish Radicals in Astoria, Oregon, 1904-1940,'' pg. 49.</ref> In Astoria this took the form of the establishment of a [[sewing]] club, designed for both social and fundraising purposes, and the foundation of a special weekly newspaper for socialist women, ''Toveritar'' (\"The Woman Comrade\").<ref name=\"Hum50\">Hummasti, ''Finnish Radicals in Astoria, Oregon, 1904-1940,'' pg. 50.</ref> ''Toveritar'' was launched as a weekly in July 1911 and it continued as such until 1930, when the publication was terminated.<ref name=\"Hum50\" /> In addition to news of the socialist movement, ''Toveritar'' included household hints, a section dedicated to the youth movement, poetry, and serialized literature (both original work and material in translation).<ref name=\"Hum50\" /> This broad array of content proved to be very successful in attracting readers even from outside the organized radical political movement, as there were few other Finnish-language American publications targeted to women.<ref name=\"Dirk1-232\">Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pp. 232-233.</ref> The paper was terminated at the end of September 1930 in favor of a new women's publication launched under the auspices of ''Ty\u00f6mies'' in Superior, Wisconsin.\n** ''[[Ty\u00f6la\u00efsnainen]]'' (The Working Woman) (October 1930 \u2013 February 1936) \u2014 With the termination of ''Toveritar,'' a new weekly communist newspaper for women was launched. ''Ty\u00f6la\u00efsnainen'' published national and local news and included articles on matters which impacted women's lives. The paper typically ran to 12 pages, with additional supplements produced for [[International Women's Day]], [[May Day]], and [[Mother's Day]]. In 1931 the paper was moved to New York and made part of the CPUSA's ''Eteenp\u00e4in'' editorial office.<ref>Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pg. 234.</ref> In February 1936, the paper was succeeded by ''Naisten Viiri.''\n** ''[[Naisten Viiri]]'' (The Woman's Banner) (February 1936 \u2013 1978) \u2014 ''Naisten Viiri'' was the final installment in the series of Finnish-language Communist publications targeted to women, continuing in the path established by ''Toveritar'' in 1911 and continued by ''Ty\u00f6la\u00efsnainen'' in 1930. ''Naisten Viiri'' was actually the longest running publication of the three, a 12-page weekly that continued to fulfill its role for more than four decades from the time of its launch in 1936. The publication attempted to address itself to a broad cross-section of Finnish-American women by mixing ideological material with general interest material and included news emphasizing themes of importance to women, articles on [[home economics]], short stories, and poetry.<ref name=\"Dirk1-221\">Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pp. 221-222.</ref> The paper was launched in Yonkers, New York by ''Eteenp\u00e4in'' and moved to Superior, Wisconsin with that publication when it was merged with ''Ty\u00f6mies,''<ref name=\"Dirk1-221\" /> its circulation gradually dwindling over time as the generations of Finnish-Americans fluent in the national tongue died out.\n* ''[[Lapatossu]]'' (The Shoepack) (1911-April 1921) \u2014 Perhaps the best known of the Finnish-language radical humor publications, ''Lapatossu'' was launched in the fall of 1911 in [[Hancock, Michigan]] by Ty\u00f6mies Publishing Co.<ref name=\"Dirk1-218\">Kostiainen, \"Finns,\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s,'' vol. 1, pp. 218-219.</ref> Initially part of the Socialist Party of America's political orbit, the publication gradually radicalized to a communist position along with the bulk of the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]].<ref name=\"Dirk1-218\" /> The magazine appeared twice a month, usually 12 pages in size, and featured the art of T.K.

Suvanto's radical humor magazine ''Lapatossu'' was rebranded ''Punikki,'' \"The Red\" in May 1921.

The decision of the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] to divide the itself into three districts gave impetus to Finnish-American socialists to launch a newspaper of their own to serve as the voice of the Federation's Western District.

For nearly two decades, the ''Volkszeitung'' remained loyal to the SPA, until the 1919 party split of that organization, which led to the establishment of the American Communist parties. ''Volkszeitung'' editor-in-chief [[Ludwig Lore]] was a founding member of the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] in 1919 and continued in the highest councils of the party until being expelled in 1925 for \"Loreism,\" proclaimed by Lore's enemies during the bitter factional war which swept the Communist Party in this period to be an indigenous form of [[Trotskyism]].<ref>Lore was a supporter of the faction headed by [[William Z.

The joined title was a compromise, as the JSF/WC sought to use the name ''Freiheit'' while the JCF wished nothing more than to keep the name ''Emes.''<ref name=\"Dirk2-622\" /> There remained two publications after the shotgun wedding, with a new daily ''Freiheit'' (edited by M.J.
