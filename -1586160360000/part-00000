This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence. This information eventually reached President Ronald Reagan, who placed Marcos under \"island arrest\", further limiting his movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1b750440d5a491184f5b2a91533774c1|title=Former Philippine President Marcos Reveals Plan to Invade Homeland|work=AP News|access-date=July 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-10/news/mn-1939_1_president-marcos|title=10,000 Troops, Billions in Gold: House Panel Hears Tapes of Marcos Plotting coup|last=GETLIN |first=JOSH |date=July 10, 1987 |work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Aquino government dismissed Marcos's statements as being a mere propaganda ploy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/07/10/Aquino-government-says-Marcos-invasion-plan-a-propaganda-ploy/2836552888000/|title=Aquino government says Marcos invasion plan a propaganda ploy|work=UPI|access-date=July 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Corruption in the Marcos Era ==\n\n===Monopolies===\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Marcos in Washington, 1983]]\nMarcos\u2019 administration spawned new oligarchs in Philippine society who became instant millionaires. These oligarchs plundered government financing institutions to finance their corporate raiding, monopolies and various takeover schemes. Marcos\u2019 cronies were awarded timber, mining and oil concessions and vast tracts of rich government agricultural and urban lands, not to mention lush government construction contracts. During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his [[Marcos Cronies|cronies]] and close personal friends. A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac. The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price. These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Testament from a Prison Cell|last=Aquino|first=Ninoy|publisher=Philippine Journal, Incorporated|year=1989|isbn=978-0962169502|location=Los Angeles|pages=}}</ref> Two of Marcos's friends were [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr.]], who would go on to control [[San Miguel Corporation]], and [[Ramon Cojuangco]], late businessman and chairman of [[PLDT]], and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of [[Corazon Aquino]]. These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to [[money laundering|launder proceeds]] from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"[[crony capitalism]]\" for personal benefit. Graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]] became more prevalent during this era. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism.\n\nMarcos and his close [[Rolex 12]] associates like [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] used their powers to settle scores against old rivals such as the Lopezes who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Enrile and the Lopezes ([[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] and [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]]) were [[Harvard]]-educated Filipino leaders. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years.

At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government.

However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet.  Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" />  The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" />  The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this  happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

The restorations was paid for by Vilma Bautista, Imelda's personal assistant and Luna 7 Development Corp., a corporation registered in New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Townhouse at 13-15 East 66th, New York City, is quite a different case from the other properties, because it was not purchased by a shell corporation but by the Philippine Consulate and the Philippine National Bank.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War.

Waldheim]], [[Zhao Ziyang]]; October 23, 1981.]]\nThe Philippine economy, heavily reliant on exports to the United States, suffered a great decline after the Aquino assassination in August 1983 because Filipino business and political leaders who studied in Harvard, Yale, and other US universities began lobbying American and foreign firms to discourage them from investing in the Philippines. This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac. The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price. These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Testament from a Prison Cell|last=Aquino|first=Ninoy|publisher=Philippine Journal, Incorporated|year=1989|isbn=978-0962169502|location=Los Angeles|pages=}}</ref> Two of Marcos's friends were [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr.]], who would go on to control [[San Miguel Corporation]], and [[Ramon Cojuangco]], late businessman and chairman of [[PLDT]], and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of [[Corazon Aquino]]. These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to [[money laundering|launder proceeds]] from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"[[crony capitalism]]\" for personal benefit. Graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]] became more prevalent during this era. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism.\n\nMarcos and his close [[Rolex 12]] associates like [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] used their powers to settle scores against old rivals such as the Lopezes who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Enrile and the Lopezes ([[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] and [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]]) were [[Harvard]]-educated Filipino leaders. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years. This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973-1974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO\u2019s foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos\u2019s term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet.  Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 Mw reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse\u2019s contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" />  The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" />  The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 Mw of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant\u2019s maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan\u2019s formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country\u2019s pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this  happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H.

The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" />  All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

(Seal himself did partnership with Fergusson Brothers, they did not ask him to convert to [[Christianity]] to do business. Education was not provided for converting to Christianity, many of the people educated outside India at the time were Christians, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]].) To counter this, there was an anti-missionary movement led by the rich and influential [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta for a free national school of their own.\n\nOne afternoon they all assembled in a meeting presided over by [[Radhakanta Deb|Raja Radha Kanta Deb]] at the [[Oriental Seminary]]. Many speeches were made and resolutions adopted, but donations recorded in the subscription book were scant. When the book passed to the hand of Seal, he immediately put down his name for one [[Lakh]] of rupees. Others who had estimated contributing a few hundred or a few thousand rupees panicked and the meeting ended.\n\nPledged to his subscription, Seal carried out the promise of a national institution with his own independent efforts. On Wednesday, 1 March 1842, a gathering of respectable people took place at his house for the formal opening of the Mutty Lall Seal's Free College. Among those present were Sir Lawrence Peel, the Chief Justice, Sir [[John Peter Grant]], Mr. Lyall, the Advocate-General, Mr. Leith, and the other principal members of the Calcutta Bar, Captain Birch, Superintendent of the Police, Mr. George Thompson, Right Reverend Dr. Carew, Baboo [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], Baboo [[Ramkamal Sen]], Baboo Russomoy Dutt and Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]]. The Catholic Bishop and all the clergy of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as all the Professors of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. Xavier's College]], were likewise present. Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended.<ref>''The Catholic Cabinet, And Chronicle of Religious Intelligence, Containing Original And Selected Articles, A Monthly Periodical'', Volume I, 1843, p 187</ref> There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as \"a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honorable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind\"''.<ref>Mullick, Promatha Nath, ''History of Vaisyas of Bengal'', p 136-139</ref>''\n\nMutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and emolument in their own country. This education included [[English Literature|english literature]], history, [[geography]], [[elocution]], writing, [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], philosophical sciences, [[Further Mathematics|higher mathematics]] and the practical application of mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, but only one rupee was charged per month to cover expenses such as books, stationery, and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time was to be limited to 500. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. F.

The institute was then placed under Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]].<ref>''The Indian Mail, A Monthly Register For British & Foreign India, China, & Australasia'', Vol. I, May\u2013December 1843, p 614-615</ref> A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the university examinations ([[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]] were some students of the college). The college initially started functioning at Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on [[Chittaranjan Avenue]] where it still exists.\n\nThe other charities which have made his name known to the public are contained in a deed of trust; by which he donated a considerable portion of his property (amounting to several [[Lakh]] of rupees) for the good of the public. A net yearly income of Rs. 36,000 derived from those properties were spent for various charitable purposes. Apart from running and maintaining the college, about Rs. 4,000 was spent on helping poor widows and orphans every year and for running and maintaining two alms houses for the poor and underprivileged.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. CXI, Calcutta, 1900, p 86-88</ref> He extended financial support and co-operation for the establishment of the Hindu Charitable Institution and Hindu Metropolitan College.

One was the reformist section led by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] and the other was the conservative section led by [[Radhakanta Deb|Radha Kanta Deb]]. Most of the rich people of Kolkata were in the latter group. Deb strongly opposed both the move to ban [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and efforts for remarriage of widows, many of whom were child-widows. Although Seal was a conservative, he was in favor of Roy's efforts of banning sati, supported the cause of women's education as well as remarriage of widows. He made a public offer for a dowry of 1000 rupees to the person who should have the courage to break through the ancient prejudices of caste and marry a widow.<ref>Ripley, George, Dana, Charles A.,''The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary Of General Knowledge'', Vol. II, 1859, p 443</ref> When Seal died on 20 May 1854, his obituary in the ''Hindu Intelligence'' described him as the \"richest and most virtuous [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta.\"<ref>Sengupta, Nitish, ''History Of The Bengali Speaking People'', p 259-260</ref> One of the busy streets in Kolkata's business district is named after him as Moti Sil Street.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1 = Chaudhuri \n | given1 = Sukanta (Ed)\n | year = 1995\n | title = Calcutta: The Living City\n | edition = \n | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]\n | ISBN = 0-19-563698-8\n}}\n* Sastri, Sivanath, ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'' in Bengali (1903/2001), p 48, New Age Publishers Pvt.

After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', 1984's ''[[Powerslave]]'', 1985's live release ''[[Live After Death]]'', 1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', and 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''. Since the return of lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with series of new albums and tours.{{sfn|Green|2010}} Their 2010 studio offering, ''[[The Final Frontier]]'', peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in 28&nbsp;countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.

For 40&nbsp;years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"[[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]]\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1975\u20131978)===\n[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985|2p=9}}]]\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=29}}\n\nThe original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]\nIron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert. Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\nHarris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}}\n\n===Record contract and early releases (1978\u20131981)===\n{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104\u2013105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=104-105}}\n\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163\u2013164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" and \"Wrathchild\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012}}\n\n[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]\nIron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]]),{{sfn|Roland|2013}} the album includes other early favourites such as \"[[Running Free]]\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980.\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=251}}\n\n===Success (1981\u20131985)===\n{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}\n\nBy 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, \"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}\n\nAfter a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}  The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed [[The Beast on the Road]], during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}}\n\nThe Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.{{sfn|Young(1)}} In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \"silliness\",{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\n[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicko McBrain]] has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982]]\nIn December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=232\u2013233}} Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}} Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' includes the successful singles, \"[[The Trooper]]\" and \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}}\n\nSoon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles \"[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]\", \"[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]\", as well as \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\", based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]], and running over 13 minutes in length.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}}\n\nThe tour, following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=102}} Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts. Their first live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}}\n\n===Experimentation (1986\u20131989)===\n{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}\n\nReturning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', featuring, for the first time in the band's history, [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"[[Wasted Years]]\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"[[Stranger in a Strange Land (Iron Maiden song)|Stranger in a Strange Land]]\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=261}} the last of which would be the album's second single.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}}\n\nThe experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, entitled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]], based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith,{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} as opposed to [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] on the previous release.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.{{sfn|RIAA}}\n\nDuring the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Helloween]].{{sfn|UK Rock Festivals}} The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}} Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=266|2a1=Johnson|2y=1988}} Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Gennet|2010}}\n\n===Upheaval (1989\u20131994)===\n{{main|No Prayer for the Dying|Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nDuring another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, ''[[The First Ten Years (boxed set)|The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten CDs and double [[12-inch single]]s. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.\n\nSoon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990,{{sfn|Prato}} and contained \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]\", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.\n\nAfter another [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out [[Fear of the Dark (song)|title track]], which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.&nbsp;1 in the UK albums chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the disc also featured the No.&nbsp;2 single \"[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]\" and the No.&nbsp;21 single \"[[From Here to Eternity (Iron Maiden song)|From Here to Eternity]]\". The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release, ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'', and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}\n\n===Blaze Bayley era, ''The X Factor'' and ''Virtual XI'' (1994\u20131999)===\n{{main|The X Factor (album)|Virtual XI}}\n\nIn 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases \u2013 a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995.

I'd heard [[Jimi Hendrix]] using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(a)}} Stating that he \"was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(c)}} Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by [[Ritchie Blackmore]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=277}} which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.{{sfn|McIver|2010(b)}}\n\nSinger Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=244}} has an operatic vocal style, inspired by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Ian Anderson]] and [[Ian Gillan]],{{sfn|Dmme.net}} and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rosen|1y=2011|2a1=HearYa.com|2y=2006|3a1=Blabbermouth.net|3y=2009a|4a1=Blabbermouth.net|4y=2009b}} Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the ''Dance of Death'' album,{{sfn|Ling|2005b}} Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=241}}\n\nThroughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',{{sfn|Prato}} keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on {{notatypo|1990's}} ''No Prayer for the Dying''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,{{sfnm|1a1=Dome|1y=2006a|2a1=Dome|2y=2006b}} which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way\".{{sfn|Dome|2006b}} According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=264}} while they would only return to this style from 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is \"like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} which [[AllMusic]] states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\",{{sfn|Huey(1)}} although Harris firmly denies this.{{sfn|VH1|2011}}\n\n==Band members==\n{{details|List of Iron Maiden band members}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Current members'''\n* [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] \u2013 [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(1975\u2013present)</small>, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s <small>(1988, 1998\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] \u2013 [[Electric guitar|guitar]]s <small>(1976\u20131977, 1978\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Adrian Smith]] \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131990, 1999\u2013present)</small>, keyboards <small>(1988)</small>\n* [[Bruce Dickinson]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]] <small>(1981\u20131993, 1999\u2013present)</small>, [[piano]] <small>(2015)</small>\n* [[Nicko McBrain]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]] <small>(1982\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Janick Gers]] \u2013 guitars <small>(1990\u2013present)</small>\n\n'''Touring musicians'''\n* Michael Kenney \u2013 keyboards <small>(1988\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''Former members'''\n* [[Doug Sampson]] \u2013 drums <small>(1977\u20131979)</small>\n* [[Paul Di'Anno]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1978\u20131981)</small>\n* [[Dennis Stratton]] \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(1979\u20131980)</small>\n* [[Clive Burr]] \u2013 drums <small>(1979\u20131982)</small>\n* [[Blaze Bayley]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1994\u20131999)</small>\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THESE MEMBERS -->\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Iron Maiden discography|List of songs recorded by Iron Maiden}}\n* ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Virtual XI]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Book of Souls]]'' (2015)\n\n==Concert tours==\n{{main|List of Iron Maiden concert tours}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Duration\n! style=\"width:220px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Concert tour\n! colspan=6|Lineups\n! style=\"width:7px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Dates\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n!Vocals\n!Bass\n! colspan=3|Guitars\n!Drums\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <small>Feb 1980</small>\n| <small>'''[[Metal for Muthas Tour]]'''</small>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| <small>'''[[Paul Di'Anno|P.

After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', 1984's ''[[Powerslave]]'', 1985's live release ''[[Live After Death]]'', 1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', and 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''. Since the return of lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with series of new albums and tours.{{sfn|Green|2010}} Their 2010 studio offering, ''[[The Final Frontier]]'', peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in 28&nbsp;countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.

For 40&nbsp;years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"[[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]]\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1975\u20131978)===\n[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985|2p=9}}]]\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=29}}\n\nThe original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]\nIron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert. Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\nHarris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}}\n\n===Record contract and early releases (1978\u20131981)===\n{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104\u2013105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=104-105}}\n\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163\u2013164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" and \"Wrathchild\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012}}\n\n[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]\nIron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]]),{{sfn|Roland|2013}} the album includes other early favourites such as \"[[Running Free]]\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980.\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=251}}\n\n===Success (1981\u20131985)===\n{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}\n\nBy 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, \"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}\n\nAfter a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}  The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed [[The Beast on the Road]], during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}}\n\nThe Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.{{sfn|Young(1)}} In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \"silliness\",{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\n[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicko McBrain]] has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982]]\nIn December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=232\u2013233}} Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}} Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' includes the successful singles, \"[[The Trooper]]\" and \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}}\n\nSoon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles \"[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]\", \"[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]\", as well as \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\", based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]], and running over 13 minutes in length.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}}\n\nThe tour, following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=102}} Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts. Their first live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}}\n\n===Experimentation (1986\u20131989)===\n{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}\n\nReturning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', featuring, for the first time in the band's history, [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"[[Wasted Years]]\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"[[Stranger in a Strange Land (Iron Maiden song)|Stranger in a Strange Land]]\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=261}} the last of which would be the album's second single.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}}\n\nThe experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, entitled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]], based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith,{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} as opposed to [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] on the previous release.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.{{sfn|RIAA}}\n\nDuring the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Helloween]].{{sfn|UK Rock Festivals}} The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}} Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=266|2a1=Johnson|2y=1988}} Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Gennet|2010}}\n\n===Upheaval (1989\u20131994)===\n{{main|No Prayer for the Dying|Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nDuring another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, ''[[The First Ten Years (boxed set)|The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten CDs and double [[12-inch single]]s. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.\n\nSoon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990,{{sfn|Prato}} and contained \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]\", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.\n\nAfter another [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out [[Fear of the Dark (song)|title track]], which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.&nbsp;1 in the UK albums chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the disc also featured the No.&nbsp;2 single \"[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]\" and the No.&nbsp;21 single \"[[From Here to Eternity (Iron Maiden song)|From Here to Eternity]]\". The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release, ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'', and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}\n\n===Blaze Bayley era, ''The X Factor'' and ''Virtual XI'' (1994\u20131999)===\n{{main|The X Factor (album)|Virtual XI}}\n\nIn 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases \u2013 a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing their next studio album, ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'', the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.&nbsp;8),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=313}} although it would go on to win ''Album of the Year'' awards in France and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}}  The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles, \"[[Man on the Edge]]\", based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]'',{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=44}} and \"[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]\", based on the [[Lord of the Flies|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Popoff|2005(b)}} The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} [[The X Factour|The band toured]] for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=314}} and ending in the [[Americas]]. After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, \"[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=316}}\n\nIn 1998, Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}}  At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).{{sfn|Saulnier|2010}}\n\nBayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=321}} although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}\n\n===Return of Dickinson and Smith, ''Brave New World'' (1999\u20132002)===\n{{main|Ed Hunter|Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)}}\n[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three guitar line-up.]]\n\nWhile the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=328}} Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'

Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\"{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004c}} On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\"{{sfn|Popoff|2005(c)}} cited as responsible for the band's galloping style,{{sfn|Fender}} heard in such songs as \"[[The Trooper]]\"{{sfn|Huey(2)}} and \"Run to the Hills.\"{{sfn|Lawson}}\n\nThe band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style.

It is part of the [[National Highway (Australia)|Auslink National Network]] and is a vital link for road freight to transport goods to and from the two cities as well as serving [[Albury-Wodonga]] and [[Canberra]].\n\nThe main alternative route between Sydney and Melbourne is the [[Princes Highway]]/[[Princes Freeway]]/[[Southern Freeway|Princes Motorway]] route (A1/M1) which follows the coast for most of its length. Other inland alternate routes include the [[Olympic Highway]] route (A41) between [[Albury]] and Sydney via [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Cowra]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and also the [[Federal Highway (Australia)|Federal Highway]] / [[Monaro Highway]] route (M23/A23/B23) via Canberra which links with the Hume Highway near [[Goulburn]] and the Princes Highway in East Gippsland.\n\nIn New South Wales during 2013, the [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] shield, National Highway 31, was replaced with a standard alphanumeric route number, the M31 south of Prestons (along with the A22 east of Liverpool into the Sydney CBD and the A28 for a short length through Liverpool). This re-numbering for the first time in over 20 years created one continuously signed route along the Hume Highway, having already been signed the M31 in Victoria during the 1990s. During 2013, the route between Berrima and Prestons was also renamed the Hume Motorway.<ref name=\"RMS Road Name Changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/alpha-numeric/nsw-factsheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Road number and name changes in NSW |page=3 |work=[[Roads and Maritime Services]] |publisher=Government of New South Wales |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325194425/http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/alpha-numeric/nsw-factsheet.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe coast of New South Wales from the [[Queensland]] border to the Victorian border is separated from the inland by an [[escarpment]], forming the eastern edge of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. There are few easy routes up this escarpment. To climb from the coast to the tablelands the Hume Highway uses the [[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo Ramp]], a geological feature which provides one of the few easy crossings of the escarpment.\n\nIn the first twenty years of European settlement at Sydney (established 1788), exploration southwest of Sydney was slow. This area was heavily wooded at the time, especially the \"[[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo brush]]\", which was regarded as almost impenetrable. In 1798 explorers (Wilson, Price, Hacking, and Collins) reached the [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] and [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] districts, but this was not followed up. Any settlement would have to await the construction of an adequate access track, which would have been beyond the colony's resources at the time, and would have served little purpose as a source of supplies for Sydney, due to the time taken to reach Sydney. In 1804, [[Charles Throsby]] penetrated through the Bargo brush to the country on the tablelands near Moss Vale and [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]]. On another expedition in 1818, he reached Lake Bathurst and the [[Goulburn|\"Goulburn Plains\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument |title=Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia 1931 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics www.abs.gov.au |accessdate=2006-04-28}}</ref> Many of the early explorers would most likely have used aboriginal guides, but they do not appear to have given them credit.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAfter Charles Throsby's 1818 journey towards present day Goulburn, followed by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell's [[Hume and Hovell expedition|overland journey]] from Appin (near Campbelltown) to Port Phillip and return in 1824, development of the Southern Tablelands for agriculture was rapid. The present route of the Hume Highway is much the same as that used by the pioneers.\n[[File:Tahmoor Gorge.jpg|thumb|290x290px|Tahmoor Gorge in its Pristine Best.]]\nThe route taken by the Hume Highway to climb from the coast to the Southern Tablelands and across the Great Divide is situated between the parallel river gorge systems of the [[Wollondilly River|Wollondilly]] and [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] rivers. This country consists generally of a gently sloping plateau which is deeply dissected by the [[Nepean River]] and its tributaries. The route of the Highway, by using four high-level bridges to cross these gorges, avoids the Razorback Range, and has minimal [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. The climb from the western side of the Nepean River at [[Menangle, New South Wales|Menangle]] up to [[Mittagong]] is fairly sustained, a fact that is hard to appreciate at high speed on the modern freeway.

The ''Main Roads Management Act'' of June 1858 declared the Great Southern Road, from near Sydney through Goulburn and [[Gundagai]] to Albury, as one of the three main roads in the colony. However, its southern reaches were described as only a 'scarcely formed bullock track' as late as 1858. The road was improved in the mid-1860s with some sections near Gundagai \"[[Road surface#Gravel surface|metalled]]\" and all creeks bridged between Adelong Creek (approximately 10 kilometres south of Gundagai and now known as the village of Tumblong) and Albury.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4309569 |title =Hillas Creek Bridge| work = Heritage and conservation register| publisher = Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales | year=2004| accessdate=16 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nMitchell's route in New South Wales, except for the bypasses at Mittagong, Berrima and [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] (dual carriageways were completed in 1986) is still largely followed by the current highway.<ref>Mitchell, T.

This route is numbered as A22. The first {{convert|31|km}}<ref name=\"Google Maps 1\"/> of the highway was known as ''Liverpool Road'' until August 1928, when it was renamed as part of the Hume or Great Southern Highway, as part of the creation of the NSW highway system. Sections of the highway through Sydney's suburbs continue to be also known by its former names of Liverpool Road, Sydney Road and Copeland Street (through Liverpool).\n\nThe main Hume Highway effectively commences at the junction of the [[M5 South Western Motorway]] and the [[Westlink M7]] at {{NSWcity|Prestons}}. Heading eastbound, the M5 provides access to [[Sydney Airport]] and the CBD; while the M7 provides access to [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Brisbane]] bypassing the Sydney CBD. Both of these routes are [[road pricing|tolled]].\n\nOther than sections within the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne, the Hume Highway is dual carriageway or expressway standard for its full length in Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nAlthough the full length of the Hume Highway is dual carriageway (with at-grade intersections and restricted entry from adjoining land), there are considerable lengths of the highway which are of full freeway standard. Most of these sections are bypasses of the larger towns on the route, where the need to deviate the route to construct the bypass made it practical to deny access from adjoining land and thus provide full freeway conditions. In addition to these bypasses the sections between Casula (in southwestern Sydney) and Berrima (built 1973\u201392), and Broadford to Wallan (1976), which were both constructed as major deviations, are also of full freeway standard. The entire section in Victoria is categorised as a freeway by government roads authority [[VicRoads]], although a few intersections along the route are not yet grade-separated. The speed limit on the full length of the highway is {{convert|110|kph|mph|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs the Hume Freeway approaches Melbourne at the suburb of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]], {{convert|27|km}} north of the [[Melbourne central business district]], the Craigieburn Bypass now diverts the Hume Freeway (and the M31 designation) to the east of the former route, to terminate at the [[Western Ring Road]]/[[Metropolitan Ring Road]] (M80). This bypass was opened in two stages, in December 2004 and December 2005.\n\nAt its Melbourne end, the original alignment of the Melbourne\u2013Sydney route followed Royal Parade northward from where it begins at its intersection with Elizabeth Street and Flemington Road. Royal Parade becomes Sydney Road at Brunswick Road and then became the Hume Highway itself at Campbellfield. This ceased to be the designated route of the Hume Highway in 1992, with the completion of Stage 1 of the Western Ring Road, at which point the designation of the southbound highway was truncated. The former highway south from the Western Ring Road to Elizabeth Street is route is now numbered as State Route 55 and is now officially called [[Old Hume Highway|Sydney Road]].\n\n===Recent New South Wales upgrading===\n[[File:Holbrook Bypass Golden Guidepost 001.JPG|thumb|A \"Golden Guidepost\" on the Holbrook Bypass section of the Hume Freeway.

Victoria's landscape differs from that of the typical 'true Australian [[Outback]]', but a dry summer can leave the ground parched. [[Mount Buffalo National Park|Mount Buffalo]] can be seen in the distance to the east as the highway comes down off the Warby Range near Glenrowan, and a museum commemorating [[Ned Kelly]] is located nearby. At Wangaratta the highway passes close to the Rutherglen and Milawa wine-producing areas.\n\nContinuing north, the [[Murray River]], the south bank of which is the Victoria-New South Wales border, is crossed on the bypass of Albury-Wodonga. From Albury, the highway skirts Lake Hume and continues across undulating country generally north-east towards Holbrook and then Tarcutta. Just north of Tarcutta the highway encounters the first of several ranges which form outliers of the Great Dividing Range, and which are crossed as the highway climbs the slopes to the tablelands west of Yass. From here the highway runs eastward, to Goulburn where it again turns northeast. Most of the New South Wales countryside from Albury to Marulan has been developed for [[wool]] production, with Yass and Goulburn in particular noted for their fine wool.\n\n===Fixed speed camera locations===\nIn April 2007, 'point-to-point' fixed speed-camera sites were installed, in the median strip along the Craigieburn Bypass section and northward to [[Broadford, Victoria|Broadford]], in Victoria, at roughly 15\u201320&nbsp;km intervals. These measure both instantaneous (flash photography) speed and its speciality in the point-to-point versions (between two or more sites and then the average speed is measured to the fixed speed limit, comparing how long it takes a vehicle to reach one point from another). There are five sites, with two cameras (radar version) at each, totalling ten altogether.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.camerassavelives.vic.gov.au/home/cameras/camera+systems/hume+freeway+point-to-point/ | title = Point-To-Point Speed Cameras - Hume Fwy | work = Speed & Red Light Cameras | publisher = Cameras Save Lives - Department of Justice (Victorian Government) [non-VicRoads] | year=2012 | accessdate =27 November 2013}}</ref><br />\nIn Sydney: next to Ashfield Primary School, near Culdees Road Burwood, Willee St Enfield, Stacey St Bankstown, Brennan St Yagoona, and Knight St Lansvale.\n[[File:Point to Point Speed Cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Point-to-point speed camera on the Hume Highway in Victoria]]\n\n===Former route allocations===\nThe Hume Highway has many former route allocations including former National Route 31.<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NationalSystem/natroutes.htm National Routes], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref> Where and when the former route numbers were implemented are stated below.\n*''Summer Hill - Chullora:''\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1994-2001)</small>\n** {{AUshield|S|31}} State Route 31 <small>(2001-2013)</small>\n*''Chullora - Casula:''<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/State%20Routes/31/sr31.htm NSW State Route 31], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|S|31}} State Route 31 <small>(1994-2013)</small>\n*''Casula - Prestons:''\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1979)</small>\n** {{AUshield|N|31}} National Highway 31 <small>(1979-1992/93)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1992/93-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|None|Met}} No Shield <small>(1994-2013)</small>\n*''Prestons - Campbelltown:''<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/Metroads/5/metroad5.htm NSW Metroad 5], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1979)</small>\n** {{AUshield|N|31}} National Highway 31 <small>(1979-1998)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1998-2013)</small>\n*''Campbelltown - NSW/Vic.

From Sydney, southwards to the Victorian border, the bypassed towns include [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]], [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]], [[Mittagong]], [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]], [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]], [[Goulburn]], [[Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], [[Bowning, New South Wales|Bowning]], [[Bookham, New South Wales|Bookham]], [[Jugiong, New South Wales|Jugiong]], [[Coolac, New South Wales|Coolac]], [[Gundagai]], [[Tarcutta, New South Wales|Tarcutta]], [[Holbrook, New South Wales|Holbrook]], [[Woomargama, New South Wales|Woomargama]] and [[Albury]].\n\nIn Victoria, all towns have been bypassed. They are, in order from the NSW border, [[Wodonga]], [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]], [[Wangaratta]], [[Benalla]], [[Euroa, Victoria|Euroa]], [[Violet Town, Victoria|Violet Town]], [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]], [[Broadford, Victoria|Broadford]] and [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]].\n\n===Camden===\n{{main|Camden, New South Wales{{!}}Camden}}\n[[File:Douglas Park Bridge F5 Freeway.jpg|thumbnail|Hume Highway at Douglas Park near Picton]]\n[[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] dates from 1840 and lies {{convert|60|km}} south west of Sydney on the Nepean River. It retains a rural character and has many historic buildings. There is an aviation museum at nearby [[Narellan, New South Wales|Narellan]]. Urban sprawl has made Camden part of the Sydney metropolitan area.\n\nBefore the mid-1980s, the Hume Highway ran west from the Cross Roads at [[Prestons, New South Wales|Prestons]], 4&nbsp;km south of Liverpool to [[Edmondson Park, New South Wales|Edmondson Park]], where it followed the route of what is now Cowpasture Road. It then ran southwest to Camden. This section is now the Camden Valley Way.\n\nThe Hume Highway has twice bypassed Camden. The first bypass was opened in 1973, via the Macarthur Bridge, and ran from Narellan to Benkennie (South Camden). This was in turn bypassed in December 1980 when a section of what was then called the South Western Freeway (route F5) from Campbelltown to Yerrinbool opened. From the north, the freeway then ran from the Cross Roads to Campbelltown Rd at St Andrews (opened August 1973) and St Andrews-Camden Road (opened December 1974) joining the southern section from Yerrinbool to Aylmerton (opened May 1977). This became the route of the Hume Highway and national route 31 in the mid 1980s.\n\nThe former highway from Camden south to Aylmerton is now called Remembrance Drive. It climbs southwards from Camden, goes through the Razorback Ridge to Picton, and then climbs to Tahmoor and Bargo. It reaches the Southern Tablelands and rejoins the present Hume Highway at Aylmerton, 6&nbsp;km north of Mittagong. The whole route from Cross Roads to Aylmerton is now state route 89.\n\n[[File:Hume Highway in NSW.jpg|thumb|right|Hume Highway through Southern Highlands]]\nAn alternative route to the highway runs from Aylmerton through Mittagong and Bowral to join the Illawarra Highway at Moss Vale and then follows the Illawarra Highway through Sutton Forest to rejoin the Hume Highway at Hoddles Crossroads (named after Surveyor Robert Hoddle who also laid out the Melbourne CBD).\n\n===Mittagong===\n{{Main|Mittagong}}\n[[Mittagong]] lies {{convert|110|km}} south-west of Sydney, just off the Hume Highway at the edge of the Southern Tablelands. Mittagong is also a part of the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] region. It is notable for being the location of Australia's first ironworks. Mittagong's streets are lined with various species of deciduous trees and it has a busy town centre.\n\nUntil August 1992 when the Mittagong bypass was opened, the town was dominated by trucks and in winter it was also busy with skiers' traffic on the way to the Australian Alps. Today the Hume Highway bypasses Mittagong and all the towns of the Southern Tablelands. In the late 1990s, engineers detected subsidence under part of the bypass where it runs along a steep slope near the Nattai River. This was caused by features of the local geology, and mining activity at the adjacent Mount Alexandra coalmine from the 1950s to the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web| year=2001 | url=http://www.dotars.gov.au/dept/media/2001/d4_2001.aspx | title=Media release: Plan to Bridge the Hume Highway at Mittagong | publisher=[[Department of Transport and Regional Services]] www.dotars.gov.au | accessdate=26 Apr 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624182524/http://www.dotars.gov.au/dept/media/2001/d4_2001.aspx|archivedate=24 June 2005}}</ref> The problem was remedied by closing one carriageway at a time and building a pair of 'land bridges' across the unstable section of the slope.\n\n===Moss Vale===\n{{main|Moss Vale|Sutton Forest}}\n[[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] has several beautiful old and attractive buildings and Leighton Gardens, in the centre of the main street, is a pleasant park. It is best during spring when its flowers are in blossom or in autumn when the leaves of its exotic deciduous trees are changing colour. [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] is surrounded by farms, vineyards and is home to elegant country homes and estates. It has a church, an inn, a couple of restaurants and one or two specialty shops.\n\n===Berrima===\n{{main|Berrima, New South Wales}}\n[[File:Hume Hwy bridges over Greenhills Rd.JPG|thumb|right|Twin bridges carrying the Hume Highway over Greenhills Road north of Berrima {{Coord|34|28|S|150|21|E|region:AU-NSW}}]]\n[[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] has flourished since it was bypassed in March 1989, with tourists finding it an easy day trip from either Sydney or [[Canberra]] to enjoy the town square and the Georgian architecture of this historic town. Berrima is the last Southern Highlands town that the Hume Highway passes.\n\n===Marulan===\n{{main|Marulan}}\nThe [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] bypass was opened in 1986. The southern part of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s road of 1819 ran from [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] roughly along existing minor roads through what is now Penrose State Forest to Canyonleigh, Brayton, Carrick and Towrang, where it joined the current route to Goulburn. Branching from this route (now part of the [[Illawarra Highway]]) just west of Sutton Forest, a road, now known as Old Argyle Road, developed in the 1820s. It ran to [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]], via [[Wingello, New South Wales|Wingello]], [[Tallong, New South Wales|Tallong]], and the southern outskirts of Marulan. Marulan lies on the [[150th meridian east]].\n\nWhen [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] rerouted the Great South Road in the 1830s, he decided to bring these two roads together to meet at old Marulan, with roads proceeding west to Goulburn and south to Bungonia. When the railway reached Marulan in 1868, the town migrated 3&nbsp;km north to the railway station. Nevertheless, the old cemetery remains at the Bungonia Road intersection. A quarry is about to be developed near the intersection, so an interchange has been built. It is at this point that the highway climbs the Marulan Ramp, which is part of the divide between the Shoalhaven and Wollondilly River systems.\n\n===Towrang Stockade===\n{{main|Towrang Convict Stockade}}\n[[File:Towrang bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Towrang bridge of 1839]]\n[[Towrang]] Creek was the site of a major stockade for chain-bound convicts and others involved in the construction of the '''Great South Road'''. The stockade was located on the western side of the Highway and was used from around 1836 to 1842. The stockade became the principal penal establishment in the southern district and was noted for its harsh discipline. There were usually at least 250 convicts stationed there. They slept on bare boards with a blanket apiece, 10 men to a box or cell. One of the two official floggers was later found murdered.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Goulburn/2005/02/17/1108500193619.html |title=Travel \u2013 Goulburn |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=26 April 2006|date=8 February 2004}}</ref> The stockade used to be accessible by a stile, but this has been taken down to discourage use of the once daunting intersection of the Highway with [[Towrang]] Road. There are the remains of the powder magazine next to the [[Wollondilly River]], three graves on the north bank of Towrang Creek, and the remains of a weir on Towrang Creek built for the stockade. Aboriginal stone tools have also been found on the banks of Towrang Creek, indicating that this was a route well-travelled long before [[Hamilton Hume]] came this way in 1824.\n\nThere is also a rest area on the eastern side of the highway, where a well-preserved bridge dating from 1839 (possibly designed by [[David Lennox]]) and a 1960s concrete box culvert can be viewed.\n\n===Goulburn===\n{{main|Goulburn}}\nAfter the cities of Liverpool and Campbelltown, [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] is the first major rural city along the Hume Highway from Sydney. It is the centre of a rich agricultural area specialising in fine wool production. From this area comes some of the world's finest [[wool]]. Therefore, the town has a monument called [[Big Merino|The Big Merino]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigmerino.com.au/|title=The Big Merino|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> near the service station. Goulburn was bypassed on 5 December 1992 and the main street (Auburn Street) is quieter, but still busy during Saturday morning shopping. Picturesque Belmore Park is located midway along Auburn Street. A number of architecturally and historically significant buildings are located near Belmore Park, including the courthouse, the post office and the railway station. Also in central Goulburn are two cathedrals, both of architectural note. A number of old houses and hotels are located near the railway station on Sloane Street.\n\n===Gunning===\n{{main|Gunning, New South Wales}}\n[[Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning's]] 19th century main street was built very wide, for the time of horse and bullock-drawn wagons. This served the town well when the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne carried cars and trucks through the town. This ceased when the bypass was completed on 5 April 1993. The town is now much quieter, and it has been able to resume a more rural pace of life. It has developed something of an industry in providing bed and breakfast accommodation. The recently built [[Gunning Wind Farm]] is located beside the highway, with its wind turbines providing a distinctive landmark.\n\n===Yass===\n{{main|Yass, New South Wales}}\n[[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] has an historic [[Yass Valley Way|main street]], with well-preserved 19th century verandah-post pubs (mostly converted to other uses). It is popular with tourists, some from [[Canberra]] and others taking a break from the Hume Highway. Hamilton Hume's farm ''Cooma Cottage'' is located east of Yass, close to the intersection of the former routes of the Hume and Barton Highways. He lived there until his death in 1873.

Gundagai was originally located on the river flats directly beside the Murrumbidgee River, but a disastrous flood in 1852 destroyed the town and drowned 89 people. The town was then relocated to its present position.

The original route led west from Tumblong along the Murrumbidgee River, before turning south over difficult country, crossing what is now the [[Sturt Highway]] and rejoining the current route of the highway as Lower Tarcutta Road. This was replaced in December 1938 by the first Tumblong deviation, to the east of the current route. The main features of this section of the highway were a deep, narrow cutting and the reinforced concrete bowstring arch bridge over Hillas Creek. This bridge has been preserved as it is one of only two bridges in New South Wales built to this design, and is visible on the western side of the highway close to the interchange with the [[Snowy Mountains Highway]]. The second and current deviation opened to traffic on 21 November 1983.\n\nApproximately {{convert|38|km}} southwest of Gundagai is the interchange with the [[Sturt Highway]], which leads to [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Mildura]] and [[Adelaide]].\n\n===Tarcutta===\n{{main|Tarcutta}}\n[[File:Tarcutta truckie memorial.jpg|thumb|National Truck Driver Memorial at Tarcutta]]\n[[Tarcutta, New South Wales|Tarcutta]] is located almost exactly halfway between Sydney and Melbourne and has been a popular stopover and change-over point for truck drivers making their way between the two cities.

The Craigieburn Bypass now links directly to the [[Western Ring Road]]/[[Metropolitan Ring Road]]. By 2013, the [[Old Hume Highway|Old Hume Highway (Sydney Road)]] section from Fawkner to Campbellfield was again becoming a bottleneck due to poor traffic signal coordination.

It is part of the [[National Highway (Australia)|Auslink National Network]] and is a vital link for road freight to transport goods to and from the two cities as well as serving [[Albury-Wodonga]] and [[Canberra]].\n\nThe main alternative route between Sydney and Melbourne is the [[Princes Highway]]/[[Princes Freeway]]/[[Southern Freeway|Princes Motorway]] route (A1/M1) which follows the coast for most of its length. Other inland alternate routes include the [[Olympic Highway]] route (A41) between [[Albury]] and Sydney via [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Cowra]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and also the [[Federal Highway (Australia)|Federal Highway]] / [[Monaro Highway]] route (M23/A23/B23) via Canberra which links with the Hume Highway near [[Goulburn]] and the Princes Highway in East Gippsland.\n\nIn New South Wales during 2013, the [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] shield, National Highway 31, was replaced with a standard alphanumeric route number, the M31 south of Prestons (along with the A22 east of Liverpool into the Sydney CBD and the A28 for a short length through Liverpool). This re-numbering for the first time in over 20 years created one continuously signed route along the Hume Highway, having already been signed the M31 in Victoria during the 1990s. During 2013, the route between Berrima and Prestons was also renamed the Hume Motorway.<ref name=\"RMS Road Name Changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/alpha-numeric/nsw-factsheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Road number and name changes in NSW |page=3 |work=[[Roads and Maritime Services]] |publisher=Government of New South Wales |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325194425/http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/alpha-numeric/nsw-factsheet.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe coast of New South Wales from the [[Queensland]] border to the Victorian border is separated from the inland by an [[escarpment]], forming the eastern edge of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. There are few easy routes up this escarpment. To climb from the coast to the tablelands the Hume Highway uses the [[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo Ramp]], a geological feature which provides one of the few easy crossings of the escarpment.\n\nIn the first twenty years of European settlement at Sydney (established 1788), exploration southwest of Sydney was slow. This area was heavily wooded at the time, especially the \"[[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo brush]]\", which was regarded as almost impenetrable. In 1798 explorers (Wilson, Price, Hacking, and Collins) reached the [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] and [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] districts, but this was not followed up. Any settlement would have to await the construction of an adequate access track, which would have been beyond the colony's resources at the time, and would have served little purpose as a source of supplies for Sydney, due to the time taken to reach Sydney. In 1804, [[Charles Throsby]] penetrated through the Bargo brush to the country on the tablelands near Moss Vale and [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]]. On another expedition in 1818, he reached Lake Bathurst and the [[Goulburn|\"Goulburn Plains\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument |title=Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia 1931 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics www.abs.gov.au |accessdate=2006-04-28}}</ref> Many of the early explorers would most likely have used aboriginal guides, but they do not appear to have given them credit.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAfter Charles Throsby's 1818 journey towards present day Goulburn, followed by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell's [[Hume and Hovell expedition|overland journey]] from Appin (near Campbelltown) to Port Phillip and return in 1824, development of the Southern Tablelands for agriculture was rapid. The present route of the Hume Highway is much the same as that used by the pioneers.\n[[File:Tahmoor Gorge.jpg|thumb|290x290px|Tahmoor Gorge in its Pristine Best.]]\nThe route taken by the Hume Highway to climb from the coast to the Southern Tablelands and across the Great Divide is situated between the parallel river gorge systems of the [[Wollondilly River|Wollondilly]] and [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] rivers. This country consists generally of a gently sloping plateau which is deeply dissected by the [[Nepean River]] and its tributaries. The route of the Highway, by using four high-level bridges to cross these gorges, avoids the Razorback Range, and has minimal [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. The climb from the western side of the Nepean River at [[Menangle, New South Wales|Menangle]] up to [[Mittagong]] is fairly sustained, a fact that is hard to appreciate at high speed on the modern freeway. The highway climbs non-stop over a distance of {{convert|16|km}} from the [[Pheasants Nest, New South Wales|Pheasants Nest]] bridge over the Nepean River to [[Yerrinbool, New South Wales|Yerrinbool]], before dropping slightly before the final climb to reach the tablelands at [[Aylmerton, New South Wales|Aylmerton]], a climb of over {{convert|430|m}} in {{convert|25|km}}.<ref>{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-34.2372996,150.6623305/-34.4072059,150.5048609/@-34.3218533,150.5137292,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e1?hl=en|title=Pheasants Nest Bridge to Aylmerton |accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Early road construction===\nGovernor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] ordered the construction of a road, which became known as the '''Great South Road''' (the basis of the northern end of the Hume Highway) in 1819 from Picton to the Goulburn Plains and he travelled to Goulburn in 1820, but it is unlikely that even a primitive road was finished at that time.\n\n[[File:Sydney Road near Benalla 1914.jpg|thumb|right|A passable section of \"Sydney Road\" in the shire of [[Benalla]], 1914.]]\nThe Great South Road was rebuilt and completely re-routed between [[Yanderra, New South Wales|Yanderra]] and Goulburn by Surveyor-General [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] in 1833. The ''Main Roads Management Act'' of June 1858 declared the Great Southern Road, from near Sydney through Goulburn and [[Gundagai]] to Albury, as one of the three main roads in the colony. However, its southern reaches were described as only a 'scarcely formed bullock track' as late as 1858. The road was improved in the mid-1860s with some sections near Gundagai \"[[Road surface#Gravel surface|metalled]]\" and all creeks bridged between Adelong Creek (approximately 10 kilometres south of Gundagai and now known as the village of Tumblong) and Albury.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4309569 |title =Hillas Creek Bridge| work = Heritage and conservation register| publisher = Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales | year=2004| accessdate=16 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nMitchell's route in New South Wales, except for the bypasses at Mittagong, Berrima and [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] (dual carriageways were completed in 1986) is still largely followed by the current highway.<ref>Mitchell, T.

Mitchell's original route between Albury and Melbourne went through [[Mitchellstown]] on the [[Goulburn River]] and took a long detour to the West of [[Mount Macedon]].<ref>Road from Jugiong Creek to Port Phillip, 12 Apr 1838, [Sketch book 3 folio 87], Department of Lands Sketch books, [Surveyor General], NRS 13886, New South Wales State Archives.</ref>\n\nIn March 1837 [[Charles Bonney]] blazed a new trail from [[Mitchellstown]] through [[Kilmore, Victoria|Kilmore]] to Melbourne, a route that took a day and a half off the previous journey. The bulk of Bonney's track formed the Sydney Road for the next 139 years.<ref>Williams, Martin, Charles Bonney and the fertile Kilmore Plains, Victorian Historical Journal, Volume 90, No. 1, June 2019, p. 108.</ref>\n\nBonney's new route of the Sydney Road was especially surveyed in 1840.<ref>{{cite web | title=Map shewing the surveyed lands at Port Phillip from the government surveys made in 1840 [cartographic material] | first=John | last=Arrowsmith | date=1 March 1841 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12014411?q&versionId=14165711 | accessdate=13 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1914 the NSW section of the highway was declared a main road. Until it was named the Hume Highway in 1928 it was known as the \"Great South Road\" in NSW and \"Sydney Road\" in Victoria. It was named after [[Hamilton Hume]], who with [[William Hovell]] were the first Europeans to traverse an overland route between Sydney and Port Phillip, in what later became Victoria.\n\nThe Hume Highway was fully sealed by 1940.\n\n===Timeline of duplication and bypass works===\nDuplication works on the highway began in the 1960s and concluded in 2013.<ref name=holbrook /> The entire route between Sydney and Melbourne is now a dual carriageway, [[limited access highway]].\n\n*1962 - [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]] to [[Barnawartha, Victoria|Barnawartha]] opened January, 1962.

''Annual report 2012-13'', Sydney, New South Wales: NSW Government, 2013. p. 18</ref>\n\n==Route==\n[[File:(Updated Route Marker) Hume Highway (NSW) Destination Distances.png|thumb|Distances to destinations through the Hume Highway heading southbound with the current M31 route number[[File:Hume Hwy (NSW) Distances Updated.gif|thumb|right|Distances to destinations along the highway from Sydney using the former National Highway 31 route marker which was replaced by the M31 Route Number]]<br />]]\n[[File:Hume Fwy (VIC) Distances.gif|thumb|right|Approximate road distances (in kilometres) along the Hume Freeway southwards from the Victorian border. Currently, VicRoads removed the National Highway sign and will only include the M31 sign. However the old style is still shown in many signs]]\nAt its Sydney end, the Hume Highway begins at [[Parramatta Road]], in [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]]. This route is numbered as A22. The first {{convert|31|km}}<ref name=\"Google Maps 1\"/> of the highway was known as ''Liverpool Road'' until August 1928, when it was renamed as part of the Hume or Great Southern Highway, as part of the creation of the NSW highway system. Sections of the highway through Sydney's suburbs continue to be also known by its former names of Liverpool Road, Sydney Road and Copeland Street (through Liverpool).\n\nThe main Hume Highway effectively commences at the junction of the [[M5 South Western Motorway]] and the [[Westlink M7]] at {{NSWcity|Prestons}}. Heading eastbound, the M5 provides access to [[Sydney Airport]] and the CBD; while the M7 provides access to [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Brisbane]] bypassing the Sydney CBD. Both of these routes are [[road pricing|tolled]].\n\nOther than sections within the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne, the Hume Highway is dual carriageway or expressway standard for its full length in Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nAlthough the full length of the Hume Highway is dual carriageway (with at-grade intersections and restricted entry from adjoining land), there are considerable lengths of the highway which are of full freeway standard. Most of these sections are bypasses of the larger towns on the route, where the need to deviate the route to construct the bypass made it practical to deny access from adjoining land and thus provide full freeway conditions. In addition to these bypasses the sections between Casula (in southwestern Sydney) and Berrima (built 1973\u201392), and Broadford to Wallan (1976), which were both constructed as major deviations, are also of full freeway standard. The entire section in Victoria is categorised as a freeway by government roads authority [[VicRoads]], although a few intersections along the route are not yet grade-separated. The speed limit on the full length of the highway is {{convert|110|kph|mph|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs the Hume Freeway approaches Melbourne at the suburb of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]], {{convert|27|km}} north of the [[Melbourne central business district]], the Craigieburn Bypass now diverts the Hume Freeway (and the M31 designation) to the east of the former route, to terminate at the [[Western Ring Road]]/[[Metropolitan Ring Road]] (M80). This bypass was opened in two stages, in December 2004 and December 2005.\n\nAt its Melbourne end, the original alignment of the Melbourne\u2013Sydney route followed Royal Parade northward from where it begins at its intersection with Elizabeth Street and Flemington Road. Royal Parade becomes Sydney Road at Brunswick Road and then became the Hume Highway itself at Campbellfield. This ceased to be the designated route of the Hume Highway in 1992, with the completion of Stage 1 of the Western Ring Road, at which point the designation of the southbound highway was truncated. The former highway south from the Western Ring Road to Elizabeth Street is route is now numbered as State Route 55 and is now officially called [[Old Hume Highway|Sydney Road]].\n\n===Recent New South Wales upgrading===\n[[File:Holbrook Bypass Golden Guidepost 001.JPG|thumb|A \"Golden Guidepost\" on the Holbrook Bypass section of the Hume Freeway. The guidepost symbolises the connection of Melbourne and Sydney by dual carriageway.]]\nBetween February 2009 and March 2012, both carriageways were widened between Brooks Road and Narellan Road. This work was undertaken in 3 stages. The first stage, widening to 4 lanes each way between Brooks Road and St Andrews Road [[St Andrews, New South Wales|St Andrews]] was completed in 2010. The second stage, widening to 4 lanes each way between St Andrews Road and Raby Road commenced in 2009 and was completed in mid-2011. The final stage, widening to 3 lanes each way between Raby Road and Narellan Road, commenced in September 2010 and was completed in March 2012.<ref name=RTA_f5_widen>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectssydney/f5widening/index.html F5 Freeway widening \u2013 RTA]</ref> Construction of a pedestrian bridge over the highway to link [[Claymore, New South Wales|Claymore]] and [[Woodbine, New South Wales|Woodbine]] was also completed. This section of the highway, opened as part of the two stages opened in October 1973 and December 1974, was originally designed for widening of the carriageways to three lanes.\n\nWork commenced in 2010 on a {{convert|9.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} bypass of Holbrook.

Victoria's landscape differs from that of the typical 'true Australian [[Outback]]', but a dry summer can leave the ground parched. [[Mount Buffalo National Park|Mount Buffalo]] can be seen in the distance to the east as the highway comes down off the Warby Range near Glenrowan, and a museum commemorating [[Ned Kelly]] is located nearby. At Wangaratta the highway passes close to the Rutherglen and Milawa wine-producing areas.\n\nContinuing north, the [[Murray River]], the south bank of which is the Victoria-New South Wales border, is crossed on the bypass of Albury-Wodonga. From Albury, the highway skirts Lake Hume and continues across undulating country generally north-east towards Holbrook and then Tarcutta. Just north of Tarcutta the highway encounters the first of several ranges which form outliers of the Great Dividing Range, and which are crossed as the highway climbs the slopes to the tablelands west of Yass. From here the highway runs eastward, to Goulburn where it again turns northeast. Most of the New South Wales countryside from Albury to Marulan has been developed for [[wool]] production, with Yass and Goulburn in particular noted for their fine wool.\n\n===Fixed speed camera locations===\nIn April 2007, 'point-to-point' fixed speed-camera sites were installed, in the median strip along the Craigieburn Bypass section and northward to [[Broadford, Victoria|Broadford]], in Victoria, at roughly 15\u201320&nbsp;km intervals. These measure both instantaneous (flash photography) speed and its speciality in the point-to-point versions (between two or more sites and then the average speed is measured to the fixed speed limit, comparing how long it takes a vehicle to reach one point from another). There are five sites, with two cameras (radar version) at each, totalling ten altogether.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.camerassavelives.vic.gov.au/home/cameras/camera+systems/hume+freeway+point-to-point/ | title = Point-To-Point Speed Cameras - Hume Fwy | work = Speed & Red Light Cameras | publisher = Cameras Save Lives - Department of Justice (Victorian Government) [non-VicRoads] | year=2012 | accessdate =27 November 2013}}</ref><br />\nIn Sydney: next to Ashfield Primary School, near Culdees Road Burwood, Willee St Enfield, Stacey St Bankstown, Brennan St Yagoona, and Knight St Lansvale.\n[[File:Point to Point Speed Cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Point-to-point speed camera on the Hume Highway in Victoria]]\n\n===Former route allocations===\nThe Hume Highway has many former route allocations including former National Route 31.<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NationalSystem/natroutes.htm National Routes], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref> Where and when the former route numbers were implemented are stated below.\n*''Summer Hill - Chullora:''\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1994-2001)</small>\n** {{AUshield|S|31}} State Route 31 <small>(2001-2013)</small>\n*''Chullora - Casula:''<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/State%20Routes/31/sr31.htm NSW State Route 31], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|S|31}} State Route 31 <small>(1994-2013)</small>\n*''Casula - Prestons:''\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1979)</small>\n** {{AUshield|N|31}} National Highway 31 <small>(1979-1992/93)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1992/93-1994)</small>\n** {{AUshield|None|Met}} No Shield <small>(1994-2013)</small>\n*''Prestons - Campbelltown:''<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/Metroads/5/metroad5.htm NSW Metroad 5], ''Ozroads'', Retrieved on 1 June 2013.{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n** {{AUshield|R|31}} National Route 31 <small>(1954-1979)</small>\n** {{AUshield|N|31}} National Highway 31 <small>(1979-1998)</small>\n** {{AUshield|Met|5}} Metroad 5 <small>(1998-2013)</small>\n*''Campbelltown - NSW/Vic.

They are, in order from the NSW border, [[Wodonga]], [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]], [[Wangaratta]], [[Benalla]], [[Euroa, Victoria|Euroa]], [[Violet Town, Victoria|Violet Town]], [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]], [[Broadford, Victoria|Broadford]] and [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]].\n\n===Camden===\n{{main|Camden, New South Wales{{!}}Camden}}\n[[File:Douglas Park Bridge F5 Freeway.jpg|thumbnail|Hume Highway at Douglas Park near Picton]]\n[[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] dates from 1840 and lies {{convert|60|km}} south west of Sydney on the Nepean River. It retains a rural character and has many historic buildings. There is an aviation museum at nearby [[Narellan, New South Wales|Narellan]]. Urban sprawl has made Camden part of the Sydney metropolitan area.\n\nBefore the mid-1980s, the Hume Highway ran west from the Cross Roads at [[Prestons, New South Wales|Prestons]], 4&nbsp;km south of Liverpool to [[Edmondson Park, New South Wales|Edmondson Park]], where it followed the route of what is now Cowpasture Road. It then ran southwest to Camden. This section is now the Camden Valley Way.\n\nThe Hume Highway has twice bypassed Camden. The first bypass was opened in 1973, via the Macarthur Bridge, and ran from Narellan to Benkennie (South Camden). This was in turn bypassed in December 1980 when a section of what was then called the South Western Freeway (route F5) from Campbelltown to Yerrinbool opened. From the north, the freeway then ran from the Cross Roads to Campbelltown Rd at St Andrews (opened August 1973) and St Andrews-Camden Road (opened December 1974) joining the southern section from Yerrinbool to Aylmerton (opened May 1977). This became the route of the Hume Highway and national route 31 in the mid 1980s.\n\nThe former highway from Camden south to Aylmerton is now called Remembrance Drive. It climbs southwards from Camden, goes through the Razorback Ridge to Picton, and then climbs to Tahmoor and Bargo. It reaches the Southern Tablelands and rejoins the present Hume Highway at Aylmerton, 6&nbsp;km north of Mittagong. The whole route from Cross Roads to Aylmerton is now state route 89.\n\n[[File:Hume Highway in NSW.jpg|thumb|right|Hume Highway through Southern Highlands]]\nAn alternative route to the highway runs from Aylmerton through Mittagong and Bowral to join the Illawarra Highway at Moss Vale and then follows the Illawarra Highway through Sutton Forest to rejoin the Hume Highway at Hoddles Crossroads (named after Surveyor Robert Hoddle who also laid out the Melbourne CBD).\n\n===Mittagong===\n{{Main|Mittagong}}\n[[Mittagong]] lies {{convert|110|km}} south-west of Sydney, just off the Hume Highway at the edge of the Southern Tablelands. Mittagong is also a part of the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] region. It is notable for being the location of Australia's first ironworks. Mittagong's streets are lined with various species of deciduous trees and it has a busy town centre.\n\nUntil August 1992 when the Mittagong bypass was opened, the town was dominated by trucks and in winter it was also busy with skiers' traffic on the way to the Australian Alps. Today the Hume Highway bypasses Mittagong and all the towns of the Southern Tablelands. In the late 1990s, engineers detected subsidence under part of the bypass where it runs along a steep slope near the Nattai River. This was caused by features of the local geology, and mining activity at the adjacent Mount Alexandra coalmine from the 1950s to the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web| year=2001 | url=http://www.dotars.gov.au/dept/media/2001/d4_2001.aspx | title=Media release: Plan to Bridge the Hume Highway at Mittagong | publisher=[[Department of Transport and Regional Services]] www.dotars.gov.au | accessdate=26 Apr 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624182524/http://www.dotars.gov.au/dept/media/2001/d4_2001.aspx|archivedate=24 June 2005}}</ref> The problem was remedied by closing one carriageway at a time and building a pair of 'land bridges' across the unstable section of the slope.\n\n===Moss Vale===\n{{main|Moss Vale|Sutton Forest}}\n[[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] has several beautiful old and attractive buildings and Leighton Gardens, in the centre of the main street, is a pleasant park. It is best during spring when its flowers are in blossom or in autumn when the leaves of its exotic deciduous trees are changing colour. [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] is surrounded by farms, vineyards and is home to elegant country homes and estates. It has a church, an inn, a couple of restaurants and one or two specialty shops.\n\n===Berrima===\n{{main|Berrima, New South Wales}}\n[[File:Hume Hwy bridges over Greenhills Rd.JPG|thumb|right|Twin bridges carrying the Hume Highway over Greenhills Road north of Berrima {{Coord|34|28|S|150|21|E|region:AU-NSW}}]]\n[[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] has flourished since it was bypassed in March 1989, with tourists finding it an easy day trip from either Sydney or [[Canberra]] to enjoy the town square and the Georgian architecture of this historic town. Berrima is the last Southern Highlands town that the Hume Highway passes.\n\n===Marulan===\n{{main|Marulan}}\nThe [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]] bypass was opened in 1986. The southern part of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s road of 1819 ran from [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] roughly along existing minor roads through what is now Penrose State Forest to Canyonleigh, Brayton, Carrick and Towrang, where it joined the current route to Goulburn. Branching from this route (now part of the [[Illawarra Highway]]) just west of Sutton Forest, a road, now known as Old Argyle Road, developed in the 1820s. It ran to [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]], via [[Wingello, New South Wales|Wingello]], [[Tallong, New South Wales|Tallong]], and the southern outskirts of Marulan. Marulan lies on the [[150th meridian east]].\n\nWhen [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] rerouted the Great South Road in the 1830s, he decided to bring these two roads together to meet at old Marulan, with roads proceeding west to Goulburn and south to Bungonia. When the railway reached Marulan in 1868, the town migrated 3&nbsp;km north to the railway station. Nevertheless, the old cemetery remains at the Bungonia Road intersection. A quarry is about to be developed near the intersection, so an interchange has been built. It is at this point that the highway climbs the Marulan Ramp, which is part of the divide between the Shoalhaven and Wollondilly River systems.\n\n===Towrang Stockade===\n{{main|Towrang Convict Stockade}}\n[[File:Towrang bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Towrang bridge of 1839]]\n[[Towrang]] Creek was the site of a major stockade for chain-bound convicts and others involved in the construction of the '''Great South Road'''. The stockade was located on the western side of the Highway and was used from around 1836 to 1842. The stockade became the principal penal establishment in the southern district and was noted for its harsh discipline. There were usually at least 250 convicts stationed there. They slept on bare boards with a blanket apiece, 10 men to a box or cell. One of the two official floggers was later found murdered.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Goulburn/2005/02/17/1108500193619.html |title=Travel \u2013 Goulburn |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=26 April 2006|date=8 February 2004}}</ref> The stockade used to be accessible by a stile, but this has been taken down to discourage use of the once daunting intersection of the Highway with [[Towrang]] Road. There are the remains of the powder magazine next to the [[Wollondilly River]], three graves on the north bank of Towrang Creek, and the remains of a weir on Towrang Creek built for the stockade. Aboriginal stone tools have also been found on the banks of Towrang Creek, indicating that this was a route well-travelled long before [[Hamilton Hume]] came this way in 1824.\n\nThere is also a rest area on the eastern side of the highway, where a well-preserved bridge dating from 1839 (possibly designed by [[David Lennox]]) and a 1960s concrete box culvert can be viewed.\n\n===Goulburn===\n{{main|Goulburn}}\nAfter the cities of Liverpool and Campbelltown, [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] is the first major rural city along the Hume Highway from Sydney. It is the centre of a rich agricultural area specialising in fine wool production. From this area comes some of the world's finest [[wool]]. Therefore, the town has a monument called [[Big Merino|The Big Merino]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigmerino.com.au/|title=The Big Merino|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> near the service station. Goulburn was bypassed on 5 December 1992 and the main street (Auburn Street) is quieter, but still busy during Saturday morning shopping. Picturesque Belmore Park is located midway along Auburn Street. A number of architecturally and historically significant buildings are located near Belmore Park, including the courthouse, the post office and the railway station. Also in central Goulburn are two cathedrals, both of architectural note. A number of old houses and hotels are located near the railway station on Sloane Street.\n\n===Gunning===\n{{main|Gunning, New South Wales}}\n[[Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning's]] 19th century main street was built very wide, for the time of horse and bullock-drawn wagons. This served the town well when the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne carried cars and trucks through the town. This ceased when the bypass was completed on 5 April 1993. The town is now much quieter, and it has been able to resume a more rural pace of life. It has developed something of an industry in providing bed and breakfast accommodation. The recently built [[Gunning Wind Farm]] is located beside the highway, with its wind turbines providing a distinctive landmark.\n\n===Yass===\n{{main|Yass, New South Wales}}\n[[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] has an historic [[Yass Valley Way|main street]], with well-preserved 19th century verandah-post pubs (mostly converted to other uses). It is popular with tourists, some from [[Canberra]] and others taking a break from the Hume Highway. Hamilton Hume's farm ''Cooma Cottage'' is located east of Yass, close to the intersection of the former routes of the Hume and Barton Highways. He lived there until his death in 1873. The Yass Bypass opened on 25 July 1994.\n\n===Bookham===\n{{main|Bookham, New South Wales}}\n[[Bookham, New South Wales|Bookham]] is situated {{convert|29|km}} west of Yass. The Hume Highway once passed through the village, but now bypasses it. This bypass was completed in two stages, the south stage opened on 18 February 1998 and the north stage opened on 11 July 2001.\n\n===Coolac===\n{{main|Coolac}}\n[[File:2 km from the Coolac - Cootamundra exit on the Hume Highway.jpg|thumb|Hume Highway near Coolac]]\nThe {{convert|11|km|adj=on}} section at [[Coolac, New South Wales|Coolac]] was the last two lane section of highway between Sydney and Gundagai until it was bypassed with a dual carriageway on 14 August 2009,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coolac Bypass |work=Roads and Traffic Authority |publisher=Government of New South Wales |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/coolac/index.html |accessdate=25 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918170506/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/coolac/index.html |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> after a delay due to indigenous heritage issues, the construction contract was awarded to [[Abigroup]] in February 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|title=More delays to highway bypass |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=14 February 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/nsw/riverina/200602/s1569224.htm |accessdate=5 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Contract awarded to construct Coolac bypass |publisher=[[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] |date=1 March 2007 |url=http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/jl/releases/2007/March/L022_2007.htm |accessdate=2007-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903183321/http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/jl/releases/2007/March/L022_2007.htm |archivedate=3 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gundagai===\n{{main|Gundagai}}\n[[File:Hume Highway.JPG|thumbnail|Hume Highway near Gundagai]]\nAt Snake Gully, adjacent to the highway north of Gundagai is the ''[[Dog on the Tuckerbox]]''. A statue (with a souvenir shop next door) was erected five miles (eight kilometres) from Gundagai. Snake Gully serves as a way station for many highway travellers.\n\nGundagai was bypassed on 25 March 1977 with the completion of the first Sheahan Bridge over the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. This bridge was the second longest road bridge in New South Wales (the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] being the longest), until the completion of the duplicate Sheahan Bridge on 17 May 2009,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/sheahan/index.html |title=Sheahan Bridge duplication \u2013 NSW RTA, accessed 2009-06-13 |access-date=13 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709083109/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/sheahan/index.html |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is now the 4th longest road bridge in New South Wales - {{convert|1|m}} longer than the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The original Sheahan Bridge was only one lane in each direction.\n\nThe [[Prince Alfred Bridge]], on the old route of the highway across the Murrumbidgee floodplain, is of major engineering interest, as it is one of Australia's longest timber trestle bridges, as is the adjacent 1903 railway bridge. Gundagai was originally located on the river flats directly beside the Murrumbidgee River, but a disastrous flood in 1852 destroyed the town and drowned 89 people. The town was then relocated to its present position. A grade-separated interchange was completed at the intersection of the Highway and West Street in December 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/weststreet/index.html |title=Hume Highway West Street Interchange Gundagai \u2013 NSW RTA, accessed 2009-06-13 |access-date=17 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830102038/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/weststreet/index.html |archive-date=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Tumblong===\n[[File:Hume Highway near the Sturt Highway turnoff.jpg|thumbnail|Near the [[Sturt Highway]] turnoff]]\nThe route of the highway between Tumblong and Tarcutta is the third route of the highway in this location. The original route led west from Tumblong along the Murrumbidgee River, before turning south over difficult country, crossing what is now the [[Sturt Highway]] and rejoining the current route of the highway as Lower Tarcutta Road. This was replaced in December 1938 by the first Tumblong deviation, to the east of the current route. The main features of this section of the highway were a deep, narrow cutting and the reinforced concrete bowstring arch bridge over Hillas Creek. This bridge has been preserved as it is one of only two bridges in New South Wales built to this design, and is visible on the western side of the highway close to the interchange with the [[Snowy Mountains Highway]]. The second and current deviation opened to traffic on 21 November 1983.\n\nApproximately {{convert|38|km}} southwest of Gundagai is the interchange with the [[Sturt Highway]], which leads to [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Mildura]] and [[Adelaide]].\n\n===Tarcutta===\n{{main|Tarcutta}}\n[[File:Tarcutta truckie memorial.jpg|thumb|National Truck Driver Memorial at Tarcutta]]\n[[Tarcutta, New South Wales|Tarcutta]] is located almost exactly halfway between Sydney and Melbourne and has been a popular stopover and change-over point for truck drivers making their way between the two cities. There is a memorial to truck drivers who have died on the local stretch of the Hume Highway. It was near Tarcutta that the final section of the Hume Highway was sealed in 1940. Construction began on a {{convert|7|km|adj=on}} bypass of Tarcutta in 2010.

From 1995, a feature of the town has been a partial reconstruction of [[HMAS Otway (S-59)|HMAS ''Otway'']], an Oberon class submarine. This landmark was in recognition of the town's namesake's connections with submarines. Holbrook had the only set of [[traffic signal]]s (for [[pedestrians]]) that remained on the Hume Highway between the [[Sydney Orbital]] and [[Melbourne]]'s [[Western Ring Road]]. A bypass, that was officially opened by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Julia Gillard]] and [[Minister for Infrastructure and Transport (Australia)|Minister for Infrastructure and Transport]], [[Anthony Albanese]] on 23 June 2013, did not open for traffic until August 2013.<ref name=weeklytimes>{{cite news|title=PM opens Holbrook bypass|url=http://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/1591144/gallery-holbrook-bypass-official-opening/|accessdate=16 July 2014|newspaper=The Weekly Times|date=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/south_western_region/hume_hway_dup/ |title=Completion of Hume Highway Duplication |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=23 April 2014 |website=Roads and Maritime Services |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Woomargama===\n{{main|Woomargama}}\n[[Woomargama, New South Wales|Woomargama]], is a village between Holbrook and Albury which acts as a local service centre for a rich woolgrowing area.

Albury, commonly associated with its Victorian twin, [[Wodonga]], is one of the few rural Australian cities to experience a boom, mainly from industrialisation in recent times.\n\nThe Albury bypass, was first proposed in 1964 but only opened on 6 March 2007. Following a series of announcements and changes of plans through the 1990s, when Albury residents failed to agree on whether an 'internal' or 'external' bypass route was more appropriate, the 'internal bypass' option was chosen.

The route is parallel to and on the eastern side of the Sydney\u2013Melbourne railway, beginning at the railway overpass {{convert|10|km}} north of Albury. After crossing the Murray River, the bypass crosses the railway to rejoin the previous highway at the southern end of the Lincoln Causeway, connecting to the Wodonga bypass. The Albury bypass includes a freeway standard connection to the Murray Valley Highway at Bandiana, east of Wodonga.\n\n===Wangaratta===\n{{main|Wangaratta}}\n[[Wangaratta]] is, after Wodonga, the largest centre in northeast Victoria, with a population of approximately 17,000 at the {{CensusAU|2011}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Wangaratta is at the junction of the [[Great Alpine Road]]. Hume and Hovell passed through this area on their 1824 expedition and the town was founded in 1837 when the surrounding area was opened for farming. The town was bypassed in 1994.\n\nAttractions include Merriwa Park, a sunken garden adjacent to the King River, Airworld at Wangaratta Airport, and old goldfield areas of nearby [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] and [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]].\n\n===Benalla===\n{{main|Benalla}}\n[[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]] is a large town located just off the Hume Freeway between Melbourne and Wangaratta. Founded in 1848, growth was slow until a goldrush in the 1850s. It had many associations with the Kelly gang and the courthouse was the venue for a number of their trials. It also has a memorial to the Australian war hero [[Edward Dunlop|Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop]], an Australian doctor who acted as a leader to allied troops on the [[Burma Railway|Thailand-Burma Railway]] in [[World War II]].\n\n===Euroa===\n{{main|Euroa}}\n[[Euroa, Victoria|Euroa]] is famous for a [[Ned Kelly]] bank robbery.

The section of the Highway from Craigieburn to Campbellfield (on Melbourne's outskirts) was a significant bottleneck, with 12 sets of [[traffic signals]] in {{convert|17|km|adj=on}} section of road. The Craigieburn Bypass now links directly to the [[Western Ring Road]]/[[Metropolitan Ring Road]]. By 2013, the [[Old Hume Highway|Old Hume Highway (Sydney Road)]] section from Fawkner to Campbellfield was again becoming a bottleneck due to poor traffic signal coordination.

''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]'' causes the diseases in west and central [[Africa]], whereas ''[[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]]'' has a limited geographical range and is responsible for causing the disease in east and southern Africa. In addition, a third subspecies of the parasite known as ''[[Trypanosoma brucei brucei]]'' is responsible for affecting animals but not humans.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\nHumans are the main reservoir for ''T. b. gambiense'' but this species can also be found in pigs and other animals. Wild game animals and cattle are the main reservoir of ''T. b. rhodesiense''. These parasites primarily infect individuals in sub-Saharan Africa because that is where the vector (tsetse fly) is located. The two human forms of the disease also vary greatly in intensity. ''T. b. gambiense'' causes a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic condition]] that can remain in a passive phase for months or years before symptoms emerge and the infection can last about 3 years before death occurs.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\n''T. b. rhodesiense'' is the [[acute (medicine)|acute]] form of the disease, and death can occur within months since the symptoms emerge within weeks and it is more virulent and faster developing than ''T. b. gambiense''. Furthermore, trypanosomes are surrounded by a coat that is composed of [[variant surface glycoprotein]]s (VSG). These proteins act to protect the parasite from any lytic factors that are present in human plasma. The host's immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different [[antibodies]] (IgM and IgG).<ref name=Brun10/>\n\nThese antibodies will then act to destroy the parasites that circulate around the blood. However, from the several parasites present in the plasma, a small number of them will experience changes in their surface coats resulting in the formation of new VSGs. Thus, the antibodies produced by the immune system will no longer recognize the parasite leading to proliferation until new antibodies are created to combat the novel VSGs. Eventually the immune system will no longer be able to fight off the parasite due to the constant changes in VSGs and infection will arise.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\n===Vector===\nThe [[tsetse fly]] (genus ''Glossina'') is a large, brown, biting fly that serves as both a host and vector for the [[Trypanosoma brucei|trypanosome]] parasites. While taking blood from a mammalian host, an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by [[binary fission]].\n\nThe entire life cycle of African trypanosomes is represented by extracellular stages. A tsetse fly becomes infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes when taking a blood meal on an infected mammalian host. In the fly's midgut, the parasites transform into procyclic trypomastigotes, multiply by binary fission, leave the midgut, and transform into epimastigotes. The epimastigotes reach the fly's salivary glands and continue multiplication by binary fission.\n\nThe entire life cycle of the fly takes about three weeks. In addition to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]], the disease can be transmitted by:\n*Mother-to-child infection: the trypanosome can sometimes cross the placenta and infect the fetus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olowe SA |title=A case of congenital trypanosomiasis in Lagos |journal=Trans.

Samples that can be used for diagnosis include [[chancre]] fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, [[bone marrow]], and, during the neurological stage, [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, [[seroconversion]] occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a ''T. b. rhodesiense'' infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nTrypanosomes can be detected from samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation can be used to look for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using [[Giemsa]]'s or [[Field stain|Field]]'s technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include centrifugation followed by examination of the [[buffy coat]]; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThree serological tests are also available for detection of the parasite: the micro-CATT (card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis), wb-CATT, and wb-LATEX.

Systematic [[screening (medicine)|screening]] of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant people with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategic Direction for African Trypanosomiasis Research|work=Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases|url=http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/direction.htm|accessdate=1 March 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322222639/http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/direction.htm|archivedate=22 March 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A single case of sexual transmission of West African sleeping sickness has been reported.<ref name=\"rocha\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===First stage===\nThe current treatment for first-stage disease is intravenous or intramuscular [[pentamidine]] for ''T. b. gambiense'' or intravenous [[suramin]] for ''T. b. rhodesiense''.<ref name=WHO2013/>\n\n[[Fexinidazole]] has been approved in the Democratic Republic Congo for T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness.<ref name=DRC2019/> Benefits include that it is taken by mouth and treats both stages of the disease.<ref name=DRC2019>{{cite web |title=Fexinidazole, the first all-oral treatment for sleeping sickness, approved in Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 DNDi |url=https://www.dndi.org/2019/media-centre/press-releases/fexinidazole-sleeping-sickness-approved-democratic-republic-congo/ |website=www.dndi.org |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Second stage===\nFor ''T. b. gambiense'' a regimen involving the combination of [[nifurtimox]] and [[eflornithine]], [[nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment]] (NECT), or eflornithine alone appear to be more effective and result in fewer side effects.<ref name=Lut2013>{{cite journal|last=Lutje|first=V|author2=Seixas, J|author3= Kennedy, A|title=Chemotherapy for second-stage human African trypanosomiasis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=28 June 2013|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD006201|pmid=23807762|pmc=6532745|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006201.pub3|url=http://archive.lstmed.ac.uk/4591/1/CDSR_6_CD006201.pdf}}</ref> These treatments may replace [[melarsoprol]] when available<ref name=Lut2013/> with the combination being first line.<ref name=Lancet2013/> NECT has the benefit of requiring less injections of eflornithine.<ref name=Lut2013/>\n\nIntravenous melarsoprol was previously the standard treatment for second-stage (neurological phase) disease and is effective for both types.<ref name=Lancet2013/> Melarsoprol is the only treatment for second stage ''T. b. rhodesiense''; however, it causes death in 5% of people who take it.<ref name=Lancet2013/> Resistance to melarsoprol can occur.<ref name=Lancet2013/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n[[File:African trypanosomiasis deaths 2002.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Deaths per 100,000 [[population]] due to African trypanosomiasis by country in 2002.<ref>[http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls WHO mortality and health data and statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116174540/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls |date=16 January 2013}}, accessed 10 February 2009.</ref>]]\n\nIn 2010, it caused around 9,000 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990.<ref name=\"Loz2012\"/> As of 2000, the disability-adjusted life-years (9 to 10 years) lost due to sleeping sickness are 2.0 million.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=World Health Organization (Geneva)|title=World Health Report 2000: Health Systems Improving Performance|year=2000|url=http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/direction.htm#Refs|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322222639/http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/direction.htm#Refs|archivedate=22 March 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> From 2010\u20132014, there was an estimated 55 million people at risk for ''gambiense'' African Trypanosomiasis and over 6 million people at risk for ''rhodesiense'' African Trypanosomiasis.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal|last=Franco|first=J.

All together, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million [[disability adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly.<ref name=G-finder/> For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.<ref name=G-finder>{{cite web |author=Moran, M. |author2=Guzman, J. |author3=Chapman, N. |author4=Abela-Oversteengen, L. |author5=Howard, R. |author6=Farrell, P. |author7=Luxford, J. |title=Neglected Disease Research and Development: The Public Divide. |url=http://www.policycures.org/downloads/GF_report13_all_web.pdf |publisher=Global Funding of Innovation for Neglected Disease |accessdate=30 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401190712/http://policycures.org/downloads/GF_report13_all_web.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor sleeping sickness, funding was split into basic research, drug discovery, vaccines, and diagnostics. The greatest amount of funding was directed towards basic research of the disease; approximately $21.6 million US dollars was directed towards that effort. As for therapeutic development, approximately $10.9 million was invested.<ref name=G-finder/>\n\nThe top funder for kinetoplastid infection research and development are public sources. About 62% of the funding comes from high-income countries while 9% comes from low- and middle-income countries. High-income countries' public funding is the largest contributor to the neglected disease research effort. However, in recent years, funding from high-income countries has been steadily decreasing; in 2007, high-income countries provided 67.5% of the total funding whereas, in 2012, high-income countries public funds only provided 60% of the total funding for kinetoplastid infections. This downwards trend leaves a gap for other funders, such as philanthropic foundations and private pharmaceutical companies to fill.<ref name=G-finder/>\n\nMuch of the progress that has been made in African sleeping sickness and neglected disease research as a whole is a result of the other non-public funders. One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to neglected disease drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding.<ref name=G-finder/> The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected disease drug development. They have provided $444.1 million US dollars towards neglected disease research in 2012. To date, they have donated over $1.02 billion US dollars towards the neglected disease discovery efforts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Strategy Overview |date=2013 |work=Neglected Infectious Diseases |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Infectious-Diseases#AreasofFocus |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101024546/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Infectious-Diseases#AreasofFocus |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor kinetoplastid infections specifically, they have donated an average of $28.15 million US dollars annually between the years 2007 to 2011.<ref name=G-finder/> They have labeled human African trypanosomiasis a high-opportunity target meaning it is a disease that presents the greatest opportunity for control, elimination, and eradication, through the development of new drugs, vaccines, public-health programs, and diagnostics. They are the second highest funding source for neglected diseases, immediately behind the US National Institutes of Health.<ref name=G-finder/> At a time where public funding is decreasing and government grants for scientific research are harder to obtain, the philanthropic world has stepped in to push the research forward.\n\nAnother important component of increased interest and funding has come from industry. In 2012, they contributed 13.1% total to the kinetoplastid research and development effort, and have additionally played an important role by contributing to public-private partnerships (PPP) as well as product-development partnerships (PDP).<ref name=G-finder/> A public-private partnership is an arrangement between one or more public entities and one or more private entities that exists to achieve a specific health outcome or to produce a health product. The partnership can exist in numerous ways; they may share and exchange funds, property, equipment, human resources, and intellectual property. These public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships have been established to address challenges in pharmaceutical industry, especially related to neglected disease research. These partnerships can help increase the scale of the effort towards therapeutic development by using different knowledge, skills, and expertise from different sources. These types of partnerships have been shown to be more effective than industry or public groups working independently.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Background Paper 8: 8.1 Public-Private Partnerships and Innovation |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/Ch8_1PPPs.pdf |title=Priority Medicines for Europe and the World Update Report |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2013 |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/en/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820013255/http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/en/ |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\n{{Main|Animal trypanosomiasis}}\n''Trypanosoma'' of both the ''rhodesiense'' and ''gambiense'' types can affect other animals such as cattle and wild animals.<ref name=WHO2013/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Offline|med}}\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{cite web |title=Sleeping sickness |publisher=[[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/issue.cfm?id=2401 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023233602/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/issue.cfm?id=2401 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060219054150/http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/hardin/md/trypanosomiasisAfr.html Links to pictures of Sleeping Sickness (Hardin MD/ [[University of Iowa]])]\n*{{cite book |first=G.D. |last=Hale Carpenter |title=A Naturalist on Lake Victoria, with an Account of Sleeping Sickness and the Tse-tse Fly |publisher=Unwin |year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalistonlake00carp |oclc=2649363}}\n{{Medical resources\n| ICD10          = {{ICD10|B|56||b|50}}\n| ICD9           = {{ICD9|086.5}}\n| ICDO           =\n| OMIM           =\n| DiseasesDB     = 29277\n| DiseasesDB_mult= {{DiseasesDB2|13400}}\n| MedlinePlus    = 001362\n| eMedicineSubj  = med\n| eMedicineTopic = 2140\n| MeshID         = D014353\n}}\n{{Protozoal diseases}}\n{{Sleep}}\n{{Diseases of poverty}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:African Trypanosomiasis}}\n[[Category:Health in Africa]]\n[[Category:Insect-borne diseases]]\n[[Category:Neglected diseases]]\n[[Category:Parasitic diseases]]\n[[Category:Protozoal diseases]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTID]]\n[[Category:Sleep disorders]]\n[[Category:Tropical diseases]]\n[[Category:Zoonoses]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect2|Sleeping sickness|Sleep fever|other uses|Sleeping sickness (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = African trypanosomiasis\n| synonyms        = Sleeping sickness, African sleeping sickness\n| alt             =\n| caption         = Trypanosoma forms in a [[blood film|blood smear]]\n| image_size      =\n| image           = Trypanosoma sp.

''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]'' causes the diseases in west and central [[Africa]], whereas ''[[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]]'' has a limited geographical range and is responsible for causing the disease in east and southern Africa. In addition, a third subspecies of the parasite known as ''[[Trypanosoma brucei brucei]]'' is responsible for affecting animals but not humans.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\nHumans are the main reservoir for ''T. b. gambiense'' but this species can also be found in pigs and other animals. Wild game animals and cattle are the main reservoir of ''T. b. rhodesiense''. These parasites primarily infect individuals in sub-Saharan Africa because that is where the vector (tsetse fly) is located. The two human forms of the disease also vary greatly in intensity. ''T. b. gambiense'' causes a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic condition]] that can remain in a passive phase for months or years before symptoms emerge and the infection can last about 3 years before death occurs.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\n''T. b. rhodesiense'' is the [[acute (medicine)|acute]] form of the disease, and death can occur within months since the symptoms emerge within weeks and it is more virulent and faster developing than ''T. b. gambiense''. Furthermore, trypanosomes are surrounded by a coat that is composed of [[Variant surface glycoprotein|variant surface glycoproteins]] (VSG). These proteins act to protect the parasite from any lytic factors that are present in human plasma. The host's immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different [[antibodies]] (IgM and IgG).<ref name=Brun10/>\n\nThese antibodies will then act to destroy the parasites that circulate around the blood. However, from the several parasites present in the plasma, a small number of them will experience changes in their surface coats resulting in the formation of new VSGs. Thus, the antibodies produced by the immune system will no longer recognize the parasite leading to proliferation until new antibodies are created to combat the novel VSGs. Eventually the immune system will no longer be able to fight off the parasite due to the constant changes in VSGs and infection will arise.<ref name=Brun10/>\n\n===Vector===\nThe [[tsetse fly]] (genus ''Glossina'') is a large, brown, biting fly that serves as both a host and vector for the [[Trypanosoma brucei|trypanosome]] parasites. While taking blood from a mammalian host, an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by [[binary fission]].\n\nThe entire life cycle of African trypanosomes is represented by extracellular stages. A tsetse fly becomes infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes when taking a blood meal on an infected mammalian host. In the fly's midgut, the parasites transform into procyclic trypomastigotes, multiply by binary fission, leave the midgut, and transform into epimastigotes. The epimastigotes reach the fly's salivary glands and continue multiplication by binary fission.\n\nThe entire life cycle of the fly takes about three weeks. In addition to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]], the disease can be transmitted by:\n*Mother-to-child infection: the trypanosome can sometimes cross the placenta and infect the fetus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olowe SA |title=A case of congenital trypanosomiasis in Lagos |journal=Trans.

Samples that can be used for diagnosis include [[chancre]] fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, [[bone marrow]], and, during the neurological stage, [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, [[seroconversion]] occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a ''T. b. rhodesiense'' infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nTrypanosomes can be detected from samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation can be used to look for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using [[Giemsa]]'s or [[Field stain|Field]]'s technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include centrifugation followed by examination of the [[buffy coat]]; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThree serological tests are also available for detection of the parasite: the micro-CATT (card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis), wb-CATT, and wb-LATEX. The first uses dried blood, while the other two use whole blood samples.

Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant people with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis.

''T. b. rhodesiense'', being a more acute and severe form of the disease, is consistently fatal if not treated.<ref name=Lancet2013/> Disease progression greatly varies depending on disease form. For individuals which are infected by ''T. b. gambiense'', which accounts for 98% of all of the reported cases, a person can be infected for months or even years without signs or symptoms until the advanced disease stage, where it is too late to be treated successfully. For individuals affected by ''T. b. rhodesiense'', which accounts for 2% of all reported cases, symptoms appear within weeks or months of the infection.

[[Kinetoplastida|Kinetoplastids]] refer to a group of flagellate protozoa.<ref name=G-finder/> Kinetoplastid infections include African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis. All together, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million [[disability adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly.<ref name=G-finder/> For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.<ref name=G-finder>{{cite web |author=Moran, M. |author2=Guzman, J. |author3=Chapman, N. |author4=Abela-Oversteengen, L. |author5=Howard, R. |author6=Farrell, P. |author7=Luxford, J. |title=Neglected Disease Research and Development: The Public Divide. |url=http://www.policycures.org/downloads/GF_report13_all_web.pdf |publisher=Global Funding of Innovation for Neglected Disease |accessdate=30 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401190712/http://policycures.org/downloads/GF_report13_all_web.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor sleeping sickness, funding was split into basic research, drug discovery, vaccines, and diagnostics. The greatest amount of funding was directed towards basic research of the disease; approximately $21.6 million US dollars was directed towards that effort. As for therapeutic development, approximately $10.9 million was invested.<ref name=G-finder/>\n\nThe top funder for kinetoplastid infection research and development are public sources. About 62% of the funding comes from high-income countries while 9% comes from low- and middle-income countries. High-income countries' public funding is the largest contributor to the neglected disease research effort. However, in recent years, funding from high-income countries has been steadily decreasing; in 2007, high-income countries provided 67.5% of the total funding whereas, in 2012, high-income countries public funds only provided 60% of the total funding for kinetoplastid infections. This downwards trend leaves a gap for other funders, such as philanthropic foundations and private pharmaceutical companies to fill.<ref name=G-finder/>\n\nMuch of the progress that has been made in African sleeping sickness and neglected disease research as a whole is a result of the other non-public funders. One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to neglected disease drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding.<ref name=G-finder/> The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected disease drug development. They have provided $444.1 million US dollars towards neglected disease research in 2012. To date, they have donated over $1.02 billion US dollars towards the neglected disease discovery efforts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Strategy Overview |date=2013 |work=Neglected Infectious Diseases |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Infectious-Diseases#AreasofFocus |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101024546/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Infectious-Diseases#AreasofFocus |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor kinetoplastid infections specifically, they have donated an average of $28.15 million US dollars annually between the years 2007 to 2011.<ref name=G-finder/> They have labeled human African trypanosomiasis a high-opportunity target meaning it is a disease that presents the greatest opportunity for control, elimination, and eradication, through the development of new drugs, vaccines, public-health programs, and diagnostics. They are the second highest funding source for neglected diseases, immediately behind the US National Institutes of Health.<ref name=G-finder/> At a time where public funding is decreasing and government grants for scientific research are harder to obtain, the philanthropic world has stepped in to push the research forward.\n\nAnother important component of increased interest and funding has come from industry. In 2012, they contributed 13.1% total to the kinetoplastid research and development effort, and have additionally played an important role by contributing to public-private partnerships (PPP) as well as product-development partnerships (PDP).<ref name=G-finder/> A public-private partnership is an arrangement between one or more public entities and one or more private entities that exists to achieve a specific health outcome or to produce a health product. The partnership can exist in numerous ways; they may share and exchange funds, property, equipment, human resources, and intellectual property. These public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships have been established to address challenges in pharmaceutical industry, especially related to neglected disease research. These partnerships can help increase the scale of the effort towards therapeutic development by using different knowledge, skills, and expertise from different sources. These types of partnerships have been shown to be more effective than industry or public groups working independently.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Background Paper 8: 8.1 Public-Private Partnerships and Innovation |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/Ch8_1PPPs.pdf |title=Priority Medicines for Europe and the World Update Report |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2013 |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/en/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820013255/http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/en/ |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\n{{Main|Animal trypanosomiasis}}\n''Trypanosoma'' of both the ''rhodesiense'' and ''gambiense'' types can affect other animals such as cattle and wild animals.<ref name=WHO2013/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Offline|med}}\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{cite web |title=Sleeping sickness |publisher=[[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/issue.cfm?id=2401 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023233602/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/issue.cfm?id=2401 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060219054150/http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/hardin/md/trypanosomiasisAfr.html Links to pictures of Sleeping Sickness (Hardin MD/ [[University of Iowa]])]\n*{{cite book |first=G.D. |last=Hale Carpenter |title=A Naturalist on Lake Victoria, with an Account of Sleeping Sickness and the Tse-tse Fly |publisher=Unwin |year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalistonlake00carp |oclc=2649363}}\n{{Medical resources\n| ICD10          = {{ICD10|B|56||b|50}}\n| ICD9           = {{ICD9|086.5}}\n| ICDO           =\n| OMIM           =\n| DiseasesDB     = 29277\n| DiseasesDB_mult= {{DiseasesDB2|13400}}\n| MedlinePlus    = 001362\n| eMedicineSubj  = med\n| eMedicineTopic = 2140\n| MeshID         = D014353\n}}\n{{Protozoal diseases}}\n{{Sleep}}\n{{Diseases of poverty}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:African Trypanosomiasis}}\n[[Category:Health in Africa]]\n[[Category:Insect-borne diseases]]\n[[Category:Neglected diseases]]\n[[Category:Parasitic diseases]]\n[[Category:Protozoal diseases]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTID]]\n[[Category:Sleep disorders]]\n[[Category:Tropical diseases]]\n[[Category:Zoonoses]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2010-2014 \u2192 2010\u20132014", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis"}

[[Ellsworth Air Force Base]] is located on the outskirts of the city. Camp Rapid, a part of the [[South Dakota Army National Guard]], is located in the western part of the city.\n\nRapid City is home to such popular attractions as Art Alley, Dinosaur Park, the City of Presidents walking tour, Chapel in the Hills, Storybook Island, Main Street Square, and more. The historic \"[[American frontier|Old West]]\" town of [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] is nearby. In the neighboring Black Hills are the tourist attractions of [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]], [[Custer State Park]], [[Wind Cave National Park]], [[Jewel Cave National Monument]], the museum at the [[Black Hills Institute of Geological Research]], and to the east of the city is [[Badlands National Park]].\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date = November 2016}}\nThe public discovery of gold in 1874 by the [[Black Hills Expedition]], led by [[George Armstrong Custer]], brought a mass influx of European-American miners and eventual settlers into this region of the Dakota Territory. Rapid City was founded in 1876 by a group of unsuccessful miners trying to create other chances; they promoted their new city as the \"Gateway to the Black Hills\"; it was originally known as \"Hay Camp.\" The \"Gateway\" nickname is shared by neighboring [[Box Elder, South Dakota|Box Elder]]. In February 1876 [[John Richard Brennan]] and Samuel Scott, with a small group of men, laid out the site of the present Rapid City. It was eventually named for the spring-fed [[Rapid Creek (South Dakota)|Rapid Creek]] that flows through it.\n\nThe land speculators measured off a square mile and designated the six blocks in the center as a business section. Committees were appointed to recruit prospective merchants and their families to locate in the new settlement. Such merchants soon began selling supplies to miners and pioneers. The city's location on the edge of the Plains and Hills and its large river valley made it a natural hub for the railroads that were constructed in the late 1880s from both the south and east. By 1900, Rapid City had survived a boom and bust and was developing as an important regional trade center for the upper Midwest.\n\nAlthough the Black Hills had become popular in the late 1890s, this became a more important destination in the 20th century. Local entrepreneurs promoted the sights, the availability of the automobile for individual transportation, and construction of improved roadways after World War I, led to greatly increased numbers of tourists to this area. [[Gutzon Borglum]], already a noted sculptor, began work on [[Mount Rushmore]] in 1927 and his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the carving of the presidents' faces in rock following his father's death in 1941. The work was halted due to the US need to invest in buildup for its entry into World War II; the massive sculpture was declared complete in 1941. Although tourism had sustained the city throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the gasoline rationing of [[World War II]] decimated such travel. But investments in the defense industry and other war-related growth stimulated the placement of new military installations in the area, bringing more businesses and residents.\n\nIn 1930, the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter inviting [[Al Capone]] to live in the Black Hills.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota Mysteries & Oddities, 2009-2010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=44|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  South Dakota's governor did not support the idea, and apparently neither did Capone, as he declined to relocate here.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:6th and Main Streets, Rapid City.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Panoramic view of Sixth and Main Streets in Rapid City, {{circa}}1912]]\nThe city benefited greatly in the 1940s from the opening of Rapid City Army Air Base, later [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] training base. The population of the area nearly doubled between 1940 and 1948, from almost 14,000 to nearly 27,000 people. Military families and civilian personnel soon took every available living space in town, and mobile home parks proliferated. Rapid City businesses profited from the military payroll.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the government constructed missile installations in the area: a series of [[Nike Air Defense]] sites were constructed around Ellsworth in the 1950s. In the early 1960s the construction of three [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan missile]] launch sites took place; these contained a total of nine Titan I missiles in the general vicinity of Rapid City. Beginning in November 1963, the land for a hundred miles east, northeast and northwest of the city was dotted with construction of 150 [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[missile silo]]s and 15 launch command centers. These were all  deactivated in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=The Brookings Institution | title =Retiring a Minuteman ICBM (LGM-30F) | work=U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project | url=http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/retire.htm | access-date=October 4, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510001730/http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/retire.htm | archivedate=May 10, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, city officials envisioned the city as a retail and wholesale trade center for the region. They developed a plan for growth that focused on a civic center, more downtown parking places, new schools, and paved streets. A construction boom continued into the 1950s. Growth slowed in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the worst natural disaster in South Dakota history, the [[Black Hills Flood of 1972]], a building boom took place over the following decade to replace damaged structures. On June 9, 1972, heavy rains caused massive flash flooding along the course of Rapid Creek through the city. 238 people died and more than $100 million in property was destroyed.\n[[Image:Rapidcreek1972flood.jpg|thumb|upright|Debris along Rapid Creek after 1972 flood.]]\n\nIn response to this devastation, the city received an outpouring of private donations and millions of dollars in federal aid. It was able to complete a major part of its 1949 plan: clearing the area along the Rapid Creek and making the floodplain a public park. In other areas, new homes and businesses were constructed to replace those that had been destroyed. [[Rushmore Plaza Civic Center]] and a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20090211081815/http://www1.rcas.org/chs/ Central High School] were built in part of the area that was cleared. The new Central High School opened in 1978, with the graduating class in that year attended classes in both the original Central (housed in what is now Rapid City High School and community theater) and the new Central.\n\nThe rebuilding generated construction and related jobs that in part insulated Rapid City from the drop in automotive tourism caused by the [[Oil Embargo]] in 1974, but tourism was depressed for most of a decade. In 1978, [[Rushmore Mall]] was built on the north edge of the city, adding to the city's position as a retail shopping center.\n\nIn 1980 in ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[Federal government of the United States]] had illegally stolen the [[Black Hills]] from the [[Sioux]] people when the government unilaterally broke the treaty that guaranteed the Black Hills belonged to the Sioux. As a result of this ruling, the federal government offered a financial settlement, but the Lakota Sioux declined on principle: that the theft of their land should not be validated. They still demand the return of the land. The settlement funds accrue interest.<ref>{{cite news | last =Giago | first =Tim | title =The Black Hills: A Case of Dishonest Dealings | work =The Huffington Post | date =2007-06-03 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/the-black-hills-a-case-o_b_50480.html | access-date =2007-10-26 }}</ref> This land includes Rapid City, which is by far the largest modern settlement in the Black Hills. As of 2019, the dispute has not been settled.\n\nIn the 1980s, tourism increased again, as the city hosted the annual [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]]; another decline occurred in the late 1990s. Fears that Ellsworth AFB would be closed under the BRAC review and base closure process in the 1990s and 2000s led to attempts to expand other sectors of the economy. Growth continued and the city expanded significantly during this period.\n\nToday, Rapid City is South Dakota's primary city for tourism and recreation. With the federal government's approval to authorize a [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] at the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] site in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]], Rapid City is primed for advancements in [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[science|scientific]] [[research]].\n\n===1972 Rapid Creek flood===\n{{Main|1972 Black Hills flood}}\n[[Image:Rapid City SD wea00703.jpg|thumb|Cars thrown together by the 1972 flood]]\nOn June 9\u201310, 1972, extremely heavy rains over the eastern [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota produced record floods on Rapid Creek and other streams in the area. Nearly {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain fell in about six hours near [[Nemo, South Dakota|Nemo]], and more than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rain fell over an area of {{convert|60|sqmi|km2|-1}}. According to the [[Red Cross]], the resulting peak floods (which occurred after dark) left 238 people dead and 3,057 people injured.<ref>{{cite web | title = The 1972 Black Hills-Rapid City Flood Revisited | publisher = United States Geological Survey | access-date = 2007-10-15 | url = http://sd.water.usgs.gov/projects/1972flood/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009114711/http://sd.water.usgs.gov/projects/1972flood/ | archive-date = 2007-10-09 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Total property destruction was estimated in excess of $160 million (about $964 million in 2018 dollars), which included 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles that were destroyed.\n\nRunoff from this storm produced record floods (highest peak flows recorded) along Battle, Spring, Rapid, and Box Elder creeks. Smaller floods also occurred along Elk and [[Bear Butte]] creeks. Canyon Lake Dam, on the west side of Rapid City, broke the night of the flood, unleashing a wall of water down the creek. The 1972 flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500 years,<ref>[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/ofr/ofr96202 (Burr and Korkow, 1996)]</ref> which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500 years. Every year there is a 0.2 percent chance (1 in 500) of a similar event occurring. To prevent similar damage, the city has prohibited residential and business construction on its flood plain. Today the flood plain is used for civic functions such as golf courses, parks, sports arenas, and arboretums, based mostly on the landscape and temporary use by people.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Rapid City Public Library]] created a 1972 Flood digital archive<ref>[http://www.rapidcitylibrary.org/lib_info/1972Flood/index.asp 1972 Flood digital archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210213624/http://www.rapidcitylibrary.org/lib_info/1972Flood/index.asp |date=2012-02-10 }}</ref> that collects survivors' stories, photos and news accounts of the flood. The Journey Museum has an interactive display on the 1972 flood; this is an ongoing project to give future generations the best idea of how the people were affected and what changes the city made as a result of the major losses of life and property. Plans include the memorialization of all those who died from the flood by the preparation of individual biographies, so they may be remembered more fully.\n\n==Geography==\nRapid City is located at {{Coord|44.076188|-103.228299|region:US-SD_type:city}}. The downtown elevation of Rapid City is 3,202 feet (976 m). Rapid City is located in the shadow of [[Black Elk Peak]], which at {{convert|7242|ft|m|0}}, is the highest point east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 55.49 square miles (143.71&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 55.41 square miles (143.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.08 square mile (0.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is water.<ref name=AFgeo>{{cite American Factfinder2|2|46103|county|name=Pennington County}}</ref>\n\nRapid City is located on the eastern edge of the Black Hills, and has developed on each side of the Dakota Hogback. Rapid City's \"Westside\" is located in the Red Valley between the foothills of the Black Hills proper and the Dakota Hogback, so named for the red Spearfish formation soils and the way the valley completely encircles the Black Hills. Rapid City has expanded into the foothills, with developments having been built on both ridges and in valleys developed, especially in the last 20 years. This arid edge area has a higher risk of wildfire, as shown by the Westberry Trails fire in 1988.\n\n[[File:Rapid City, South Dakota seen from Dinosaur Park.jpg|thumb|right|View of the city from [[Dinosaur Park]]]]\n\nSkyline Drive follows the summits of the Dakota Hogback south from near Rapid Gap (where Rapid Creek cuts through the Hogback) to a large high plateau that forms the current south edge of Rapid City. The Central and Eastern portions of Rapid City lie in the wide valley of Rapid Creek outside the Hogback. It includes a number of mesas rising a hundred feet or more above the floodplain.\n\n===Rapid Creek===\nRapid Creek flows through Rapid City, emerging from Dark Canyon above Canyon Lake and flowing in a large arc north of downtown. It descends to the southeast where the valley widens. Since the flood damage of 1972, the city has prohibited most development in the [[floodplain]] of Rapid Creek. It has adapted this green space for public uses: a series of parks, arboretums, and bike trails, which have reconnected the city to the creek for residents.\n\nTo the north, a series of ridges separate Rapid Creek from Box Elder Creek. Both older and new residential areas and commercial areas have developed here, along [[I-90]]. To the south, the terrain rises more steeply to the southern widening of the Dakota Hogback into a plateau dividing the Rapid Creek drainage from Spring Creek.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Rapid City from Rapid Valley 090604.jpg|thumb|View of southern Rapid City from the east after a rainstorm, including a view of [[Black Elk Peak]] and the [[Black Hills]]]]\nRapid City features a [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''), and is part of USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 5a.<ref>{{cite web |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service }}</ref> Its location makes its climate unlike both the higher elevations of the Black Hills and the Great Plains to the east.

The [http://heapc.org Health Education and Promotion Council] and [http://bhcaih.org Black Hills Center for American Indian Health] are two notable non-profit organizations.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:RCPL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rapid City Public Library]]]]\nThe Rapid City Public Library is a major resource for education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapid City Public Library Homepage|url=http://www.rcgov.org/departments/library.html|website=rcgov.org|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRapid City institutions of higher education include the [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]], [[Oglala Lakota College]]'s He Sapa College Center, [[Black Hills State University]] - Rapid City University Center (includes classes and degrees through five other South Dakota post-secondary Institutions), [[National American University]], [[Western Dakota Technical Institute]], [[Black Hills Beauty College]], [[John Witherspoon College]], and several small sectarian preacher training schools.\n\n[[Black Hills State University]] is located in nearby [[Spearfish, South Dakota|Spearfish]] and offers several classes in Rapid City. The South Dakota state nurse training program is based in Rapid City.\n\nIn 2013, 26.6 percent of Rapid City residents 25 years or over had earned a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Educational Attainment|url=http://southdakotadashboard.org/workforce/educational-attainment#0-6734-g|publisher=South Dakota Dashboard|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> This is on par with the average [[educational attainment in the United States]]. The highest rates of educational attainment in South Dakota can be found in metropolitan areas of Rapid City and Sioux Falls.\n\nThe local public schools fall under the [[Rapid City Area Schools]] [[school district]]. There are three high schools within the district: [[Central High School (Rapid City, South Dakota)|Central]], [[Stevens High School (South Dakota)|Stevens]] and the newly renovated Rapid City High School, which also houses the Performing Arts Center. The middle schools include East, North, South, Southwest, and West. There are 16 elementary schools within the district.

Kennedy and John Jr. Bronze.jpg|thumb|President John F. Kennedy and John Jr, The City of Presidents, Rapid City, SD.]]\n\nRapid City has invested in [[public sculpture]]s, which are on display in many parts of the city. The most visible is \"The City of Presidents\", a series of life-sized [[bronze statues]] representing each former [[President of the United States]]. The statues are located on street corners in the downtown area. Five South Dakota artists created the statues: [[Edward E. Hlavka]], [[Lee Leuning]], [[John Lopez]], [[James Michael Maher]], and [[James Van Nuys]].<ref>[http://www.visitrapidcity.com/whattodo/thecityofpresidents/ visitrapidcity.com], ''[[Rapid City South Dakota Convention & Visitors Bureau]]'', Rapid City, 2010. Retrieved on November 15, 2010.</ref> The first 42 statues were erected via private donations over a ten-year period between 2000 and 2010. As of 2019, [[Barack Obama]] is the most recent president to have a statue erected; currently sitting presidents are ineligible.\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{SisterCities|Rapid City|three}}\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Apolda]], [[Thuringia]], Germany\n* {{flagdeco|Japan}} [[Nikk\u014d, Tochigi|Nikk\u014d]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], Japan\n[https://sites.google.com/a/nikko-rapid-sister-city.org/rapid-city-nikko-sister-city/home Rapid City Nikko City Sister City Association]\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Yangshuo County]], [[Guangxi]], China\n\n==Industry and economy==\nRapid City's economy is diverse, but industry is a small portion, as is typical of many US cities in the 21st century. Heavy and medium industrial activities include a [[Portland cement]] plant (constructed and owned for 84 years<ref>Created by SD Constitutional Amendment, 1919.</ref> by the State of South Dakota and sold in 2003 to [[Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua|GCC]], a Mexican-based conglomerate); [[Black Hills Ammunition]], an ammunition and reloading supplies manufacturing company; several custom sawmills, a lime plant, a computer peripheral component manufacturing plant, and several farm and ranch equipment manufacturers. Of particular note, this city is the center for the manufacture of [[Black Hills gold jewelry]], a popular product with tourists and Westerners in general. The city is the site of the only American manufacturer of stamping machines used for the labeling of plywood and chipboard products.\n\nMost gold mining has ceased in the Black Hills and was never conducted in or near Rapid City. Regional mining operations include for sand and gravel, as well as the raw materials for [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and Portland cement (including chemical-grade [[limestone]], taconite iron ore, and gypsum) remains an important part of the economy.\n\nThe largest sector of the Rapid City economy is government services, including local, state, and federal. Major employers include [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]],<ref name=Economy>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Rapid City: Economy | publisher =City-Data.com | url =http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Rapid-City-Economy.html | access-date =2008-10-16 }}</ref> home of the [[28th Bomb Wing]] flying the [[B-1B]] long-range bomber; the [[Army National Guard]] based at [[Camp Rapid]] and hosting annual exercises in the Black Hills, drawing troops from five to ten states; and various federal agencies, including the [[National Park Service]], [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]], and [[Indian Health Service]].\n\nRegional Health covers one of the largest geographic service areas in the United States. The health care sector employs more than 8,000 persons in the Rapid City area.<ref name=Economy/>\n\nTourism constitutes a major portion of the Rapid City economy,<ref name=Economy/> due to the proximity of [[Mount Rushmore]], Sturgis, home of the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]]; [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], and other attractions in the Black Hills. This city provides most services for the Motorcycle Rally. Prepared to satisfy the Rally's demand for motel rooms, camp sites, and other services for tourists during the first week of August, Rapid City has the capacity to host other large events, such as conventions, and numerous associated tourists year-round. Various minor tourist attractions, including wildlife parks, specialty shops, caves, water parks, private museums, and other businesses are found in and near Rapid City.\n\nOther economic sectors include financial service and investing companies such as [[Waddell and Reed]], [[Citibank]], [[WaMu]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Northwestern Mutual]]. Rapid City is the headquarters for [[Assurant]] Insurance's pre-need division. As noted, the city has a strong medical services sector, and several institutions of higher education. Rapid City is also the major market town for much of five states, drawing commerce from more than half of South Dakota, and large portions of [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and the [[Nebraska Panhandle]].\n\nThe real compound annual growth rate of the [[gross domestic product]] of the [[Rapid City Metropolitan Statistical Area]] was 2.6% for 2001\u20132013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Output (GDP)|url=http://southdakotadashboard.org/economy/economic-output-gdp#0-7138-d|publisher=South Dakota Dashboard|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><!-- And how does that compare to similar cities? -->\n\n==Transportation==\n===Air===\nRapid City is a major transportation hub for the Northern Plains. [[Rapid City Regional Airport]] provides flights to the airline hub cities of [[Denver]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]/Mesa, [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]] and [[Chicago]]. The airport also has extensive [[General Aviation]] operations, including wildfire fighting activities, and medical flight support to Rapid City medical facilities and regional Indian Health Service operations.\n\n===Railroad===\nHistorically, Rapid City was served by three railroads. Following extensive restructuring in the industry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the city is now served only by the [[Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad]] (RCP&E). In addition to Rapid City, the RCP&E serves the Northern Black Hills and run east to Minnesota and south through Nebraska to connect with major transcontinental railroads [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] and [[Union Pacific]]. Until the 1950s [[Chicago and Northwestern Railroad]] ran a daily passenger train from [[Chicago]] to Rapid City. Neither South Dakota nor Wyoming have any [[Amtrak]] service.\n\n===Road===\nRapid City's central location on the continent enables it to transport products to both coasts, and points in between. Trucking is a major business activity in the city. Improved connections with [[Denver]] and I-80 to the south, via the [[Heartland Expressway]] now under construction, will primarily benefit local trucking.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}\n* [[Interstate 90]] is the primary east\u2013west route for Rapid City. The city is served by a series of 7 exits. I-90 skims the northern side of the city. The [[South Dakota Department of Transportation|South Dakota DOT]] has been reconstructing most of these interchanges in the last five years.\n* [[Interstate 190 (South Dakota)|Interstate 190]] is an Interstate spur linking downtown Rapid City to [[Interstate 90]].\n* [[U.S. Route 16|US Highway 16]] is the main route to the southwest and the [[Black Hills]] from Rapid City. It links Rapid City to [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]] and then west to [[Newcastle, Wyoming]], where it connects to [[U.S. Route 85|US Highway 85]] for travel to [[Cheyenne]] and Denver. Reconstructed in the mid-1960s as a four-lane parkway connecting Rapid City to Mount Rushmore, since 2008 major segments have been rebuilt as three-lane, or \"super-two\" highways, to support increased tourist traffic.\n* [[South Dakota Highway 44]] is a state highway that links the interior of the [[Black Hills]] to the southwest of Rapid City, and the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] and nearby areas in the Great Plains to the southeast.\n* [[South Dakota Highway 79]] is a state highway that is multiplexed with I-90 northwest of Rapid City. SD Highway 79 extends to [[North Dakota]]. South of Rapid City to [[Nebraska]], Highway 79 is being reconstructed as the Heartland Expressway, a high-speed, four-lane highway that will eventually connect to [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska and the [[Colorado Front Range]] near [[Denver]]. The Heartland Expressway may eventually be extended along US Highway 85 north to [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], to create an additional major north\u2013south artery through the [[Great Plains]] that would pass through Rapid City.\n\nRapid City is located on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids. It is served by the hydroelectric plants of the two Mainstem dams on the Missouri River, and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. It is located where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa. Rapid City had its own coal-fired power plant but could not afford to meet current air pollution standards and closed it. Closed for similar reasons were coal-fired power stations near [[Gillette, Wyoming]]. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than 2 years ahead of its scheduled shut down. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Following the shut down of the plants dependent on cheap, polluting coal, electrical rates have risen. The city has had to spend more to import electricity over a longer distance.\n\n[[File:Officer candidates step off to final training phase 110716-A-DI382-012.jpg|thumb|[[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] officer candidates take part in a tactical road march through a west Rapid City neighborhood]]\nRapid City obtains most of its water supply from Rapid Creek and the alluvial aquifers associated with the creek, owning significant water rights in Pactola Reservoir located some {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city, but does also obtain water from some springs in the vicinity, and has the ability to draw water from deep formations that receive water from recharge in areas of the Black Hills where the formations come to the surface. The heavy dependence on shallow alluvial aquifers is of some concern to planners, as most suburbs of Rapid City use septic systems for domestic sewage treatment. However, water supplies remain relatively good for future growth.\n\nRapid City has a municipally owned bus service, providing multiple [[bus stops]] and a headquarters in the city. It has limited city-to-city bus service along I-90. Charter bus services operate in the area, connecting Rapid City and Deadwood with cities in Colorado, Nebraska, and Iowa.\n\n==Suburbs==\n{{Main|Rapid City metropolitan area}}\nThe estimated 2013 population of the [[Rapid City Metropolitan Statistical Area]] ([[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]], [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade County]] and [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]]) was 141,131.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population trends|url=http://southdakotadashboard.org/demographics/population-trends#0-6551-d|publisher=South Dakota Dashboard|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> A significant portion of residents from cities and towns in the Black Hills and nearby plains commute to Rapid City for work.

[[Ellsworth Air Force Base]] is located on the outskirts of the city. Camp Rapid, a part of the [[South Dakota Army National Guard]], is located in the western part of the city. \n\nRapid City is home to such popular attractions as Art Alley, Dinosaur Park, the City of Presidents walking tour, Chapel in the Hills, Storybook Island, Main Street Square, and more. The historic \"[[American frontier|Old West]]\" town of [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] is nearby. In the neighboring Black Hills are the tourist attractions of [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]], [[Custer State Park]], [[Wind Cave National Park]], [[Jewel Cave National Monument]], the museum at the [[Black Hills Institute of Geological Research]], and to the east of the city is [[Badlands National Park]].\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date = November 2016}}\nThe public discovery of gold in 1874 by the [[Black Hills Expedition]], led by [[George Armstrong Custer]], brought a mass influx of European-American miners and eventual settlers into this region of the Dakota Territory. Rapid City was founded in 1876 by a group of unsuccessful miners trying to create other chances; they promoted their new city as the \"Gateway to the Black Hills\"; it was originally known as \"Hay Camp.\" The \"Gateway\" nickname is shared by neighboring [[Box Elder, South Dakota|Box Elder]]. In February 1876 [[John Richard Brennan]] and Samuel Scott, with a small group of men, laid out the site of the present Rapid City. It was eventually named for the spring-fed [[Rapid Creek (South Dakota)|Rapid Creek]] that flows through it. \n\nThe land speculators measured off a square mile and designated the six blocks in the center as a business section. Committees were appointed to recruit prospective merchants and their families to locate in the new settlement. Such merchants soon began selling supplies to miners and pioneers. The city's location on the edge of the Plains and Hills and its large river valley made it a natural hub for the railroads that were constructed in the late 1880s from both the south and east. By 1900, Rapid City had survived a boom and bust and was developing as an important regional trade center for the upper Midwest.\n\nAlthough the Black Hills had become popular in the late 1890s, this became a more important destination in the 20th century. Local entrepreneurs promoted the sights, the availability of the automobile for individual transportation, and construction of improved roadways after World War I, led to greatly increased numbers of tourists to this area. [[Gutzon Borglum]], already a noted sculptor, began work on [[Mount Rushmore]] in 1927 and his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the carving of the presidents' faces in rock following his father's death in 1941. The work was halted due to the US need to invest in buildup for its entry into World War II; the massive sculpture was declared complete in 1941. Although tourism had sustained the city throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the gasoline rationing of [[World War II]] decimated such travel. But investments in the defense industry and other war-related growth stimulated the placement of new military installations in the area, bringing more businesses and residents. \n\nIn 1930, the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter inviting [[Al Capone]] to live in the Black Hills.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota Mysteries & Oddities, 2009-2010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=44|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  South Dakota's governor did not support the idea, and apparently neither did Capone, as he declined to relocate here.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:6th and Main Streets, Rapid City.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Panoramic view of Sixth and Main Streets in Rapid City, {{circa}}1912]]\nThe city benefited greatly in the 1940s from the opening of Rapid City Army Air Base, later [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] training base. The population of the area nearly doubled between 1940 and 1948, from almost 14,000 to nearly 27,000 people. Military families and civilian personnel soon took every available living space in town, and mobile home parks proliferated. Rapid City businesses profited from the military payroll.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the government constructed missile installations in the area: a series of [[Nike Air Defense]] sites were constructed around Ellsworth in the 1950s. In the early 1960s the construction of three [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan missile]] launch sites took place; these contained a total of nine Titan I missiles in the general vicinity of Rapid City. Beginning in November 1963, the land for a hundred miles east, northeast and northwest of the city was dotted with construction of 150 [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[missile silo]]s and 15 launch command centers. These were all  deactivated in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=The Brookings Institution | title =Retiring a Minuteman ICBM (LGM-30F) | work=U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project | url=http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/retire.htm | access-date=October 4, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510001730/http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/retire.htm | archivedate=May 10, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, city officials envisioned the city as a retail and wholesale trade center for the region. They developed a plan for growth that focused on a civic center, more downtown parking places, new schools, and paved streets. A construction boom continued into the 1950s. Growth slowed in the 1960s. \n\nFollowing the worst natural disaster in South Dakota history, the [[Black Hills Flood of 1972]], a building boom took place over the following decade to replace damaged structures. On June 9, 1972, heavy rains caused massive flash flooding along the course of Rapid Creek through the city. 238 people died and more than $100 million in property was destroyed.\n[[Image:Rapidcreek1972flood.jpg|thumb|upright|Debris along Rapid Creek after 1972 flood.]]\n\nIn response to this devastation, the city received an outpouring of private donations and millions of dollars in federal aid. It was able to complete a major part of its 1949 plan: clearing the area along the Rapid Creek and making the floodplain a public park. In other areas, new homes and businesses were constructed to replace those that had been destroyed. [[Rushmore Plaza Civic Center]] and a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20090211081815/http://www1.rcas.org/chs/ Central High School] were built in part of the area that was cleared. The new Central High School opened in 1978, with the graduating class in that year attended classes in both the original Central (housed in what is now Rapid City High School and community theater) and the new Central. \n\nThe rebuilding generated construction and related jobs that in part insulated Rapid City from the drop in automotive tourism caused by the [[Oil Embargo]] in 1974, but tourism was depressed for most of a decade. In 1978, [[Rushmore Mall]] was built on the north edge of the city, adding to the city's position as a retail shopping center.\n\nIn 1980 in ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[Federal government of the United States]] had illegally stolen the [[Black Hills]] from the [[Sioux]] people when the government unilaterally broke the treaty that guaranteed the Black Hills belonged to the Sioux. As a result of this ruling, the federal government offered a financial settlement, but the Lakota Sioux declined on principle: that the theft of their land should not be validated. They still demand the return of the land. The settlement funds accrue interest.<ref>{{cite news | last =Giago | first =Tim | title =The Black Hills: A Case of Dishonest Dealings | work =The Huffington Post | date =2007-06-03 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/the-black-hills-a-case-o_b_50480.html | access-date =2007-10-26 }}</ref> This land includes Rapid City, which is by far the largest modern settlement in the Black Hills. As of 2019, the dispute has not been settled.\n\nIn the 1980s, tourism increased again, as the city hosted the annual [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]]; another decline occurred in the late 1990s. Fears that Ellsworth AFB would be closed under the BRAC review and base closure process in the 1990s and 2000s led to attempts to expand other sectors of the economy. Growth continued and the city expanded significantly during this period.\n\nToday, Rapid City is South Dakota's primary city for tourism and recreation. With the federal government's approval to authorize a [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] at the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] site in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]], Rapid City is primed for advancements in [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[science|scientific]] [[research]].\n\n===1972 Rapid Creek flood===\n{{Main|1972 Black Hills flood}}\n[[Image:Rapid City SD wea00703.jpg|thumb|Cars thrown together by the 1972 flood]]\nOn June 9\u201310, 1972, extremely heavy rains over the eastern [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota produced record floods on Rapid Creek and other streams in the area. Nearly {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain fell in about six hours near [[Nemo, South Dakota|Nemo]], and more than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rain fell over an area of {{convert|60|sqmi|km2|-1}}. According to the [[Red Cross]], the resulting peak floods (which occurred after dark) left 238 people dead and 3,057 people injured.<ref>{{cite web | title = The 1972 Black Hills-Rapid City Flood Revisited | publisher = United States Geological Survey | access-date = 2007-10-15 | url = http://sd.water.usgs.gov/projects/1972flood/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009114711/http://sd.water.usgs.gov/projects/1972flood/ | archive-date = 2007-10-09 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Total property destruction was estimated in excess of $160 million (about $964 million in 2018 dollars), which included 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles that were destroyed. \n\nRunoff from this storm produced record floods (highest peak flows recorded) along Battle, Spring, Rapid, and Box Elder creeks. Smaller floods also occurred along Elk and [[Bear Butte]] creeks. Canyon Lake Dam, on the west side of Rapid City, broke the night of the flood, unleashing a wall of water down the creek. The 1972 flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500 years,<ref>[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/ofr/ofr96202 (Burr and Korkow, 1996)]</ref> which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500 years. Every year there is a 0.2 percent chance (1 in 500) of a similar event occurring. To prevent similar damage, the city has prohibited residential and business construction on its flood plain. Today the flood plain is used for civic functions such as golf courses, parks, sports arenas, and arboretums, based mostly on the landscape and temporary use by people.  \n\nIn 2007, the [[Rapid City Public Library]] created a 1972 Flood digital archive<ref>[http://www.rapidcitylibrary.org/lib_info/1972Flood/index.asp 1972 Flood digital archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210213624/http://www.rapidcitylibrary.org/lib_info/1972Flood/index.asp |date=2012-02-10 }}</ref> that collects survivors' stories, photos and news accounts of the flood. The Journey Museum has an interactive display on the 1972 flood; this is an ongoing project to give future generations the best idea of how the people were affected and what changes the city made as a result of the major losses of life and property. Plans include the memorialization of all those who died from the flood by the preparation of individual biographies, so they may be remembered more fully.\n\n==Geography==\nRapid City is located at {{Coord|44.076188|-103.228299|region:US-SD_type:city}}. The downtown elevation of Rapid City is 3,202 feet (976 m). Rapid City is located in the shadow of [[Black Elk Peak]], which at {{convert|7242|ft|m|0}}, is the highest point east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 55.49 square miles (143.71&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 55.41 square miles (143.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.08 square mile (0.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is water.<ref name=AFgeo>{{cite American Factfinder2|2|46103|county|name=Pennington County}}</ref>\n\nRapid City is located on the eastern edge of the Black Hills, and has developed on each side of the Dakota Hogback. Rapid City's \"Westside\" is located in the Red Valley between the foothills of the Black Hills proper and the Dakota Hogback, so named for the red Spearfish formation soils and the way the valley completely encircles the Black Hills. Rapid City has expanded into the foothills, with developments having been built on both ridges and in valleys developed, especially in the last 20 years. This arid edge area has a higher risk of wildfire, as shown by the Westberry Trails fire in 1988.\n\n[[File:Rapid City, South Dakota seen from Dinosaur Park.jpg|thumb|right|View of the city from [[Dinosaur Park]]]]\n\nSkyline Drive follows the summits of the Dakota Hogback south from near Rapid Gap (where Rapid Creek cuts through the Hogback) to a large high plateau that forms the current south edge of Rapid City. The Central and Eastern portions of Rapid City lie in the wide valley of Rapid Creek outside the Hogback. It includes a number of mesas rising a hundred feet or more above the floodplain.\n\n===Rapid Creek===\nRapid Creek flows through Rapid City, emerging from Dark Canyon above Canyon Lake and flowing in a large arc north of downtown. It descends to the southeast where the valley widens. Since the flood damage of 1972, the city has prohibited most development in the [[floodplain]] of Rapid Creek. It has adapted this green space for public uses: a series of parks, arboretums, and bike trails, which have reconnected the city to the creek for residents. \n\nTo the north, a series of ridges separate Rapid Creek from Box Elder Creek. Both older and new residential areas and commercial areas have developed here, along [[I-90]]. To the south, the terrain rises more steeply to the southern widening of the Dakota Hogback into a plateau dividing the Rapid Creek drainage from Spring Creek.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Rapid City from Rapid Valley 090604.jpg|thumb|View of southern Rapid City from the east after a rainstorm, including a view of [[Black Elk Peak]] and the [[Black Hills]]]]\nRapid City features a [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''), and is part of USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 5a.<ref>{{cite web |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service }}</ref> Its location makes its climate unlike both the higher elevations of the Black Hills and the Great Plains to the east.

The most visible is \"The City of Presidents\", a series of life-sized [[bronze statues]] representing each former [[President of the United States]]. The statues are located on street corners in the downtown area. Five South Dakota artists created the statues: [[Edward E. Hlavka]], [[Lee Leuning]], [[John Lopez]], [[James Michael Maher]], and [[James Van Nuys]].<ref>[http://www.visitrapidcity.com/whattodo/thecityofpresidents/ visitrapidcity.com], ''[[Rapid City South Dakota Convention & Visitors Bureau]]'', Rapid City, 2010.

Heavy and medium industrial activities include a [[Portland cement]] plant (constructed and owned for 84 years<ref>Created by SD Constitutional Amendment, 1919.</ref> by the State of South Dakota and sold in 2003 to [[Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua|GCC]], a Mexican-based conglomerate); [[Black Hills Ammunition]], an ammunition and reloading supplies manufacturing company; several custom sawmills, a lime plant, a computer peripheral component manufacturing plant, and several farm and ranch equipment manufacturers. Of particular note, this city is the center for the manufacture of [[Black Hills gold jewelry]], a popular product with tourists and Westerners in general. The city is the site of the only American manufacturer of stamping machines used for the labeling of plywood and chipboard products.\n\nMost gold mining has ceased in the Black Hills and was never conducted in or near Rapid City. Regional mining operations include for sand and gravel, as well as the raw materials for [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and Portland cement (including chemical-grade [[limestone]], taconite iron ore, and gypsum) remains an important part of the economy.\n\nThe largest sector of the Rapid City economy is government services, including local, state, and federal. Major employers include [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]],<ref name=Economy>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Rapid City: Economy | publisher =City-Data.com | url =http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Rapid-City-Economy.html | access-date =2008-10-16 }}</ref> home of the [[28th Bomb Wing]] flying the [[B-1B]] long-range bomber; the [[Army National Guard]] based at [[Camp Rapid]] and hosting annual exercises in the Black Hills, drawing troops from five to ten states; and various federal agencies, including the [[National Park Service]], [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]], and [[Indian Health Service]].\n\nRegional Health covers one of the largest geographic service areas in the United States. The health care sector employs more than 8,000 persons in the Rapid City area.<ref name=Economy/>\n\nTourism constitutes a major portion of the Rapid City economy,<ref name=Economy/> due to the proximity of [[Mount Rushmore]], Sturgis, home of the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]]; [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], and other attractions in the Black Hills. This city provides most services for the Motorcycle Rally. Prepared to satisfy the Rally's demand for motel rooms, camp sites, and other services for tourists during the first week of August, Rapid City has the capacity to host other large events, such as conventions, and numerous associated tourists year-round. Various minor tourist attractions, including wildlife parks, specialty shops, caves, water parks, private museums, and other businesses are found in and near Rapid City.\n\nOther economic sectors include financial service and investing companies such as [[Waddell and Reed]], [[Citibank]], [[WaMu]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Northwestern Mutual]]. Rapid City is the headquarters for [[Assurant]] Insurance's pre-need division. As noted, the city has a strong medical services sector, and several institutions of higher education. Rapid City is also the major market town for much of five states, drawing commerce from more than half of South Dakota, and large portions of [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and the [[Nebraska Panhandle]].\n\nThe real compound annual growth rate of the [[gross domestic product]] of the [[Rapid City Metropolitan Statistical Area]] was 2.6% for 2001\u20132013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Output (GDP)|url=http://southdakotadashboard.org/economy/economic-output-gdp#0-7138-d|publisher=South Dakota Dashboard|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><!-- And how does that compare to similar cities? -->\n\n==Transportation==\n===Air===\nRapid City is a major transportation hub for the Northern Plains. [[Rapid City Regional Airport]] provides flights to the airline hub cities of [[Denver]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]/Mesa, [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]] and [[Chicago]]. The airport also has extensive [[General Aviation]] operations, including wildfire fighting activities, and medical flight support to Rapid City medical facilities and regional Indian Health Service operations.\n\n===Railroad===\nHistorically, Rapid City was served by three railroads. Following extensive restructuring in the industry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the city is now served only by the [[Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad]] (RCP&E). In addition to Rapid City, the RCP&E serves the Northern Black Hills and run east to Minnesota and south through Nebraska to connect with major transcontinental railroads [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] and [[Union Pacific]]. Until the 1950s [[Chicago and Northwestern Railroad]] ran a daily passenger train from [[Chicago]] to Rapid City. Neither South Dakota nor Wyoming have any [[Amtrak]] service. \n\n===Road===\nRapid City's central location on the continent enables it to transport products to both coasts, and points in between. Trucking is a major business activity in the city. Improved connections with [[Denver]] and I-80 to the south, via the [[Heartland Expressway]] now under construction, will primarily benefit local trucking.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}\n* [[Interstate 90]] is the primary east-west route for Rapid City. The city is served by a series of 7 exits. I-90 skims the northern side of the city. The [[South Dakota Department of Transportation|South Dakota DOT]] has been reconstructing most of these interchanges in the last five years.\n* [[Interstate 190 (South Dakota)|Interstate 190]] is an Interstate spur linking downtown Rapid City to [[Interstate 90]].\n* [[U.S. Route 16|US Highway 16]] is the main route to the southwest and the [[Black Hills]] from Rapid City. It links Rapid City to [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]] and then west to [[Newcastle, Wyoming]], where it connects to [[U.S. Route 85|US Highway 85]] for travel to [[Cheyenne]] and Denver. Reconstructed in the mid-1960s as a four-lane parkway connecting Rapid City to Mount Rushmore, since 2008 major segments have been rebuilt as three-lane, or \"super-two\" highways, to support increased tourist traffic.\n* [[South Dakota Highway 44]] is a state highway that links the interior of the [[Black Hills]] to the southwest of Rapid City, and the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] and nearby areas in the Great Plains to the southeast.\n* [[South Dakota Highway 79]] is a state highway that is multiplexed with I-90 northwest of Rapid City. SD Highway 79 extends to [[North Dakota]]. South of Rapid City to [[Nebraska]], Highway 79 is being reconstructed as the Heartland Expressway, a high-speed, four-lane highway that will eventually connect to [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska and the [[Colorado Front Range]] near [[Denver]]. The Heartland Expressway may eventually be extended along US Highway 85 north to [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], to create an additional major north-south artery through the [[Great Plains]] that would pass through Rapid City.\n\nRapid City is located on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids. It is served by the hydroelectric plants of the two Mainstem dams on the Missouri River, and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. It is located where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa. Rapid City had its own coal-fired power plant but could not afford to meet current air pollution standards and closed it. Closed for similar reasons were coal-fired power stations near [[Gillette, Wyoming]]. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than 2 years ahead of its scheduled shut down. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Following the shut down of the plants dependent on cheap, polluting coal, electrical rates have risen. The city has had to spend more to import electricity over a longer distance. \n\n[[File:Officer candidates step off to final training phase 110716-A-DI382-012.jpg|thumb|[[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] officer candidates take part in a tactical road march through a west Rapid City neighborhood]]\nRapid City obtains most of its water supply from Rapid Creek and the alluvial aquifers associated with the creek, owning significant water rights in Pactola Reservoir located some {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city, but does also obtain water from some springs in the vicinity, and has the ability to draw water from deep formations that receive water from recharge in areas of the Black Hills where the formations come to the surface. The heavy dependence on shallow alluvial aquifers is of some concern to planners, as most suburbs of Rapid City use septic systems for domestic sewage treatment. However, water supplies remain relatively good for future growth.\n\nRapid City has a municipally owned bus service, providing multiple [[bus stops]] and a headquarters in the city. It has limited city-to-city bus service along I-90. Charter bus services operate in the area, connecting Rapid City and Deadwood with cities in Colorado, Nebraska, and Iowa. \n\n==Suburbs==\n{{Main|Rapid City metropolitan area}}\nThe estimated 2013 population of the [[Rapid City Metropolitan Statistical Area]] ([[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]], [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade County]] and [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]]) was 141,131.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population trends|url=http://southdakotadashboard.org/demographics/population-trends#0-6551-d|publisher=South Dakota Dashboard|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> A significant portion of residents from cities and towns in the Black Hills and nearby plains commute to Rapid City for work.

From 1983\u20131987 the events aired live on closed-circuit TV under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events started airing live on pay-per-view TV while still under the NWA banner. In November 1988 Jim Crockett Promotions sold its assets to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which used them to rebrand the company as World Championship Wrestling. Beginning in 1991 and lasting until 2001, the pay-per-view events were promoted under the WCW banner. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the WCW/[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] brand.\n\nIn 2001, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], now known as WWE, purchased the assets of WCW, including the [[WWE Libraries|video libraries]] of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, [[The Great American Bash]], from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] special. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade name for a non-televised [[house show]].\n\nBeginning in 2014, nearly all NWA and WCW pay-per-view events were made available on the [[WWE Network]].\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) closed-circuit television events==\n===1983===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 24\n|[[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Harley Race]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1984===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 22\n|[[Starrcade (1984)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1985===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|July 6\n|[[The Great American Bash (1985)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[American Legion Memorial Stadium]]\n|[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n|[[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|-\n|November 28\n|[[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]\n|}\n\n===1986===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n|November 27\n|[[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]<br>[[The Omni]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]<br>[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Nikita Koloff]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) pay-per-view events==\n===1987===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|November 26\n|[[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ron Garvin]] vs. [[Ric Flair]]\n|}\n\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|January 24\n|[[Bunkhouse Stampede (1988)|The Bunkhouse Stampede Finals]]\n|[[Nassau Coliseum]]\n|[[Uniondale, New York]]\n|[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] vs. [[Arn Anderson]] vs. [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] vs. [[Tully Blanchard]] vs. [[Ivan Koloff]] vs. [[Lex Luger]] vs. [[Road Warrior Animal]] vs. [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]\n|-\n|July 10\n|[[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n==NWA (World Championship Wrestling) pay-per-view events==\n===1988===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|December 26\n|[[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Norfolk Scope]]\n|[[Norfolk, Virginia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|}\n\n===1989===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 20\n|[[Chi-Town Rumble]]\n|[[UIC Pavilion]]\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Ricky Steamboat]]\n|-\n|May 7\n|[[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]]\n|[[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|[[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Rick Steiner]] vs. [[Varsity Club]] ([[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Dan Spivey]])\n|-\n|July 23\n|[[The Great American Bash (1989)|The Great American Bash]]\n|[[Baltimore Arena]]\n|[[Baltimore]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|October 28\n|[[Halloween Havoc (1989)|Halloween Havoc]]\n|[[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Philadelphia Civic Center]]\n|[[Philadelphia]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] vs. [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] and [[Terry Funk]]\n|-\n|December 13\n|[[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade]]\n|[[Omni Coliseum|The Omni]]\n|[[Atlanta]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]\n|}\n\n===1990===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n! width=8%| Date\n! width=14%| Event\n! width=14%| Venue\n! width=14%| Location\n! width=50%| Main event\n|-\n\n|February 25\n|[[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar]]\n|[[Greensboro Coliseum]]\n|[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|[[Ric Flair]] vs. [[Lex Luger]]\n|-\n|May 19\n|[[Capital Combat]]\n|[[D.C.

From 1983\u20131987 the events aired live on closed-circuit TV under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events started airing live on pay-per-view TV while still under the NWA banner. In November 1988 Jim Crockett Promotions sold its assets to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which used them to rebrand the company as World Championship Wrestling. Beginning in 1991 and lasting until 2001, the pay-per-view events were promoted under the WCW banner. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the WCW/[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] brand.\n\nIn 2001, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], now known as WWE, purchased the assets of WCW, including the [[WWE Libraries|video libraries]] of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, [[The Great American Bash]], from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] special.

Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation; for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] (ICTU) can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.\n\nAs the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the D\u00e1il in the next general election.

The school was founded for this purpose but has long since become an independent public school.\n\nThe choristers' day begins at 7:30, with an early morning practice before school. There is further practice immediately after school, followed by Choral Evensong six nights a week, in term; the Tuesday service is sung by the boys only, and the Friday service only by the Academical Clerks. On Sundays there is a practice at 9:30 am followed by Eucharist, then a further afternoon practice followed by Evensong which ends at 7:00 pm. As of September 2010, the choristers no longer sing on most Saturday evenings following the formation of the Consort of Voices, a mixed voice choir which sings on most Saturdays in full term.\n\nThe choir records regularly. In 2005, it was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for its [[Compact disc|CD]], ''With a Merrie Noyse'', of music by [[Orlando Gibbons]]. Other recent works include the BBC's ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' and Paul McCartney's classical piece ''[[Ecce Cor Meum]]''.

It contains a large collection of manuscripts from before the 19th century. Consultation of material is typically by appointment, although the Old Library itself may be visited by the public during certain exhibitions.<ref name=\"libraries\">{{cite web |url=https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/libraries-and-archives/libraries/ |title=Magdalen's Libraries |website=Magdalen College}}</ref><ref name=\"womenlibraryexhibition\">{{cite web |url=https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/libraries-and-archives/news/new-exhibition-opening-in-september-women-and-power-a-magdalen-story/ |title=New exhibition opening in September: \"Women and Power?

It was opened by [[Edward VIII]] when he was a student at Magdalen.<ref name=\"telegraphWilliam\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/11/prince-william-follows-in-edward-viiis-footsteps-by-opening-new/ |last=Rayner |first=Gordon |date=11 May 2016 |title=Prince William follows in Edward VIII's footsteps by opening new library at Oxford's Magdalen College |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> It was renovated between 2014 and 2016 by [[Wright & Wright Architects]] and reopened by [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]].<ref name=\"archdaily\">{{cite web |url=https://www.archdaily.com/882330/longwall-library-magdalen-college-wright-and-wright-architects |title=Longwall Library - Magdalen College / Wright & Wright Architects |website=Arch Daily}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraphWilliam\" />\n\nIn addition, the college maintains the Denning Law Library in the Grove building, a reference library for Magdalen's law students, and the specialist Daubeny and McFarlane collections of 19th century scientific works and medieval history works respectively. Items from the Daubeny and McFarlane libraries may be brought to the Longwall Library for consultation on request.<ref name=\"libraries\" />\n\n==Grounds==\n\n===The Grove===\n[[File:Magdalen Deer.jpg|thumb|right|The deer in the Grove]]\nThe Grove or deer park is large meadow which occupies most of the north west of the college's grounds, from the New Building and the Grove Buildings to Holywell Ford. During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of [[fallow deer]]. It is possible to view the meadow and the deer from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings.\n\nIn the 16th century, long before the introduction of the deer, the grove consisted of gardens, orchards, and [[bowling green]]s. During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], it was used to house a regiment of soldiers. At one point in the 19th century it was home to three traction engines belonging to the works department of the college.  By the 20th century it had become well-wooded with many large trees, but most of them were lost to [[Dutch elm disease]] in the 1970s.\n\n===Water meadow and Addison's Walk===\n[[File:Magdalen college oxford water meadow flooded 1.jpg|thumb|Water meadow after winter flooding. The New Building is visible side on in the background.]]\nThe water meadow is a [[flood-meadow]] to the eastern side of the College, bounded on all sides by the [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]]. In wet winters, some or all of the meadow may flood, as the meadow is lower lying than the surrounding path. All around the edge of the meadow is a tree-lined path, [[Addison's Walk]], named for the fellow [[Joseph Addison]] (1672-1719), which connects to Holywell Ford and the Fellows' Garden.<ref name=\"flora and fauna grounds\" />\n\nAddison's Walk is popular with College members and visitors. [[C. S.

The school was founded for this purpose but has long since become an independent public school.\n\nThe choristers' day begins at 7:30, with an early morning practice before school. There is further practice immediately after school, followed by Choral Evensong six nights a week, in term; the Tuesday service is sung by the boys only, and the Friday service only by the Academical Clerks. On Sundays there is a practice at 9:30 am followed by Eucharist, then a further afternoon practice followed by Evensong which ends at 7:00 pm. As of September 2010, the choristers no longer sing on most Saturday evenings following the formation of the Consort of Voices, a mixed voice choir which sings on most Saturdays in full term.\n\nThe choir records regularly. In 2005, it was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for its [[Compact disc|CD]], ''With a Merrie Noyse'', of music by [[Orlando Gibbons]]. Other recent works include the BBC's ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' and Paul McCartney's classical piece ''[[Ecce Cor Meum]]''. The choir has numerous college duties as well as a recording and touring schedule. Traditionally the choir sings at college [[Gaudy|Gaudies]] and at other special events throughout the year, as well as performing on social occasions such as Carols by Candlelight before Christmas and the famous [[May Morning]]. \n\n===May Morning===\n{{main|May Morning}}\nAnnually at 6 a.m. on 1 May, the choir perform [[Hymnus Eucharisticus]] from the top of Magdalen's Tower to crowds below on Madgalen Bridge and the High Street. This tradition dates back 500 years, and forms the central event in Oxford's [[May Morning]] celebration. \n\n===Organists===\n{{See also|Organ scholar}}\nThe choir has had many well-known organists, such as [[Daniel Purcell]], Sir [[John Stainer]] (1860\u20131872) and [[Bernard Rose (musician)|Bernard Rose]] (1957\u20131981).
