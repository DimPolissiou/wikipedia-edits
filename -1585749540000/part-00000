There is a link between chronic tic disorders, which include Tourette syndrome and other disorders like ADHD and OCD. According to a study published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, there is an especially high risk for children to be born with a chronic tic disorder if their mother is a heavy smoker. Heavy smoking can be defined as ten or more cigarettes each day. With this heavy smoking, researchers have found that there is an increase in risk as high as 66% for the child to have a chronic tic disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also associated with psychiatric disorders such as ADHD. Concerning the increase risk for Tourette syndrome, there is an increased risk when two or more psychiatric disorders are also existent as maternal smoking leads to a higher chance of having a psychiatric disorder. \nE.

In 2004, 11.9% of babies born to smokers had low birthweight as compared to only 7.2% of babies born to nonsmokers.  More specifically, infants born to smokers weigh on average 200&nbsp;grams less than infants born to women who do not smoke.<ref name=\"CDC\">{{cite web |title=2004 Surgeon General's Report|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2004/pdfs/chapter5.pdf|website=Chapter 5 Reproductive Effects|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe nicotine in cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels in the placenta and carbon monoxide, which is poisonous, enters the baby's bloodstream, replacing some of the valuable oxygen molecules carried by hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Moreover, because the fetus cannot breathe the smoke out, it has to wait for the placenta to clear it. These effects account for the fact that, on average, babies born to smoking mothers are usually born too early and have low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds), making it more likely the baby will become sick or die.\n<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Engebretson\n |first       = Joan\n |date        = 2013\n |title       = Materinity Nursing Care\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |location    = Canada\n |publisher   = Nelson Education, Ltd.\n |page        = 417\n |isbn        = 978-1-111-54311-2\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161029174838/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |archive-date = 29 October 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nPremature and low birth weight babies face an increased risk of serious health problems as newborns have chronic lifelong disabilities such as [[cerebral palsy]] (a set of motor conditions causing physical disabilities), [[mental retardation]] and learning problems.\n\n====Sudden infant death syndrome====\n[[Sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant that is unexplainable by the infant's history.  The death also remains unexplainable upon autopsy.

While no significant differences could be found between young teenagers with smoking mothers as compared to young teenagers with nonsmoking mothers, older teenagers with smoking mothers were found to have on average 26% more [[body fat]] and 33% more abdominal fat than similar aged teenagers with non-smoking mothers.  This increase in body fat may result from the effects of smoking during pregnancy, which is thought to impact fetal genetic programming in relation to obesity.  While the exact mechanism for this difference is currently unknown, studies conducted on animals have indicated that nicotine may affect brain functions that deal with eating impulses and energy metabolism.  These differences appear to have a significant effect on the maintenance of a healthy, normal weight.  As a result of this alteration to brain function, teenage obesity can in turn lead to a variety of health problems including [[diabetes]] (a condition in which the affected individual's blood glucose level is too high and the body is unable to regulate it), [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and [[cardiovascular disease]] (any affliction related to the heart but most commonly the thickening of arteries due to excess fat build-up).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |title       = Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Obesity\n |access-date = 6 November 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104204414/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |archive-date = 4 November 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====Future smoking habits====\nStudies indicate that smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of offspring beginning to smoke at an early age.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Quitting during pregnancy===\nQuitting smoking at any point during pregnancy is more beneficial than continuing to smoke throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, especially if it is done within the [[first trimester]] (within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). A recent study suggests, however, that women who smoke anytime during the first trimester put their fetus at a higher risk for birth defects, particularly [[congenital heart defects]] (structural defects in the heart of an infant that can hinder blood flow) than women who have never smoked.  That risk only continues to increase the longer into the pregnancy a woman smokes, as well as the larger number of cigarettes she is smoking. This continued increase in risk throughout pregnancy means that it can still be beneficial for a pregnant woman to quit smoking for the remainder of her [[gestation period]].<ref name=\"varvadas\"/>\n\nThere are many resources to help pregnant women quit smoking such as counseling and drug therapies.  For non-pregnant smokers, an often-recommended aid to quitting smoking is through the use of [[nicotine replacement therapy]] in the form of patches, gum, inhalers, lozenges, sprays or sublingual tablets (tablets which you place under the tongue).  However, it is important to note that the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is questionable for pregnant women as these treatments still deliver nicotine to the child.  For some pregnant smokers, NRT might still be the most beneficial and helpful solution to quit smoking.  It is important that smokers talk to doctor to determine the best course of action on an individual basis.<ref name=\"march\">March, Penny D., and Carita Caple. \"Smoking Cessation and Pregnancy.\" Ed.

There is a link between chronic tic disorders, which include Tourette syndrome and other disorders like ADHD and OCD. According to a study published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, there is an especially high risk for children to be born with a chronic tic disorder if their mother is a heavy smoker. Heavy smoking can be defined as ten or more cigarettes each day. With this heavy smoking, researchers have found that there is an increase in risk as high as 66% for the child to have a chronic tic disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also associated with psychiatric disorders such as ADHD. Concerning the increase risk for Tourette syndrome, there is an increased risk when two or more psychiatric disorders are also existent as maternal smoking leads to a higher chance of having a psychiatric disorder. \nE.

Moreover, because the fetus cannot breathe the smoke out, it has to wait for the placenta to clear it. These effects account for the fact that, on average, babies born to smoking mothers are usually born too early and have low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds), making it more likely the baby will become sick or die.\n<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Engebretson\n |first       = Joan\n |date        = 2013\n |title       = Materinity Nursing Care\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |location    = Canada\n |publisher   = Nelson Education, Ltd.\n |page        = 417\n |isbn        = 978-1-111-54311-2\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161029174838/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/10/29/danger-of-smoking-for-pregnancy/\n |archive-date = 29 October 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nPremature and low birth weight babies face an increased risk of serious health problems as newborns have chronic lifelong disabilities such as [[cerebral palsy]] (a set of motor conditions causing physical disabilities), [[mental retardation]] and learning problems.\n\n====Sudden infant death syndrome====\n[[Sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant that is unexplainable by the infant's history.

Recently the U.S. Public Health Service reported that if all pregnant women in the United States stopped smoking, there would be an estimated 11% reduction in stillbirths and a 5% reduction in newborn deaths.<ref name=\"CDC\"/>\n\n====Future obesity====\nA recent study has proposed that maternal smoking during pregnancy can lead to future teenage [[obesity]].  While no significant differences could be found between young teenagers with smoking mothers as compared to young teenagers with nonsmoking mothers, older teenagers with smoking mothers were found to have on average 26% more [[body fat]] and 33% more abdominal fat than similar aged teenagers with non-smoking mothers.  This increase in body fat may result from the effects of smoking during pregnancy, which is thought to impact fetal genetic programming in relation to obesity.  While the exact mechanism for this difference is currently unknown, studies conducted on animals have indicated that nicotine may affect brain functions that deal with eating impulses and energy metabolism.  These differences appear to have a significant effect on the maintenance of a healthy, normal weight.  As a result of this alteration to brain function, teenage obesity can in turn lead to a variety of health problems including [[diabetes]] (a condition in which the affected individual's blood glucose level is too high and the body is unable to regulate it), [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and [[cardiovascular disease]] (any affliction related to the heart but most commonly the thickening of arteries due to excess fat build-up).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |title       = Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Obesity\n |access-date = 6 November 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104204414/http://alohapapamama.com/2016/11/04/maternal-smoking-during-pregnancy-and-childhood-obesity/\n |archive-date = 4 November 2016\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====Future smoking habits====\nStudies indicate that smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of offspring beginning to smoke at an early age.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Quitting during pregnancy===\nQuitting smoking at any point during pregnancy is more beneficial than continuing to smoke throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, especially if it is done within the [[first trimester]] (within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). A recent study suggests, however, that women who smoke anytime during the first trimester put their fetus at a higher risk for birth defects, particularly [[congenital heart defects]] (structural defects in the heart of an infant that can hinder blood flow) than women who have never smoked.  That risk only continues to increase the longer into the pregnancy a woman smokes, as well as the larger number of cigarettes she is smoking. This continued increase in risk throughout pregnancy means that it can still be beneficial for a pregnant woman to quit smoking for the remainder of her [[gestation period]].<ref name=\"varvadas\"/>\n\nThere are many resources to help pregnant women quit smoking such as counseling and drug therapies.  For non-pregnant smokers, an often-recommended aid to quitting smoking is through the use of [[nicotine replacement therapy]] in the form of patches, gum, inhalers, lozenges, sprays or sublingual tablets (tablets which you place under the tongue).  However, it is important to note that the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is questionable for pregnant women as these treatments still deliver nicotine to the child.  For some pregnant smokers, NRT might still be the most beneficial and helpful solution to quit smoking.  It is important that smokers talk to doctor to determine the best course of action on an individual basis.<ref name=\"march\">March, Penny D., and Carita Caple. \"Smoking Cessation and Pregnancy.\" Ed.

There is evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against many [[infectious diseases]], especially diarrhea. Even in babies exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine through breast milk, the likelihood of acute respiratory illness is significantly diminished when compared to infants whose mothers smoked but were formula fed.<ref name=\"menella\">{{cite journal |last1=Mennella |first1=J.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time.

Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].

It was written by [[Harry Venning]] and [[Neil Brand]] and produced by [[Katie Tyrell]].\n\n==Situation==\nThe series concerns \"Beagle Team\", an undercover surveillance unit comprising Bill Cooper ([[Richard Lumsden]]), who harbours unrequited passion for team leader Sharla Jasumani  ([[Nina Conti]]), and the ex-criminal Mark Walker ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]).  Lumsden and Conti also appear in Venning's somewhat more well-known comedy \"[[Clare in the Community]]\".\n\nThe typical mission involves the team attempting to listen in on conversations in places such as hotels, houses, and yachts.   The mission is usually interrupted by such distractions as police trying to get their parked vehicle to move on, fallout from Mark's attempts to make money on the side, unexpected numbers of customers for the food van they are using as a cover, and occasional rogue agents from one side or the other.\n\n==Characters==\n* Bill Cooper ([[Richard Lumsden]]), the team's technician.  His \"mission log\", spoken aloud, acts as introduction and linkage for the plot, and tends to veer into expressions of his yearning for Sharla, which he then expunges with \"delete delete delete!\".\n* Sharla Jasumani  ([[Nina Conti]]), team leader.  Sharla has a strong Northern Ireland accent and a pugnacious attitude.  She has unresolved issues with her superiors in the agency and is fiercely competitive with the other surveillance teams.  The head of the department, codenamed \"Huntsman\", seems to be her uncle.  In one episode she starts an unauthorised operation to spy on her lover.\n* Mark Walker ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]), a former criminal forced to work with the agency.  He is a streetwise Londoner who excels in talking his way out of situations.  He also likes to make money on the side.  When the team uses a lunch van as a cover, his culinary efforts attract too much attention, and he begins to dream of a mention in a gourmet magazine.\n\n==Episode list==\n===Series 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

Chandru hesitates to reciprocate as she is the sister of his close friend. Chandru seeks the help of Krishna Murthy to avoid Amrita. Later, Aravind and Chandru go to Hyderabad to work with Krishna Murthy. When this trio is assigned to renovate an old palatial house, Aravind encounters Padmini ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), later falling in love with her. When Padmini gets engaged to another man, Chandru feels that Padmini cheated Aravind after loving him. Aravind and Padmini realize that Padmini's jealous cousin is responsible for their split. Subsequently, Aravind's jealous cousin lies to Chandru that Aravind intentionally killed Chandu's brother when they were young. In an ensuing struggle, Aravind falls from a cliff and gets paralysed and goes into a coma. Although Chandru tried to save Aravind, he blames himself for Aravind's fall. Chandru later realizes that his brother was in fact accidentally killed, and that Chandru wasn't intentionally at fault.

He was a son of Omer William Schietekat, a textile manufacturer, and Paula Sylvia Snoeck. In 1961, he married Maria Magdalena Vereecke (Myl\u00e8ne), and together they had three children, a twin Jan and Paul in 1963 and in 1966 [[Sophie]]. He died in a car accident in [[Pittem|Egem]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAt the Nuns Catholic School in Berkenboom he was considered a mediocre student. He went to high school at the ''Sint-Lievenscollege'' in [[Antwerp]] and the ''Sint-Jozef Klein Seminarie'' in Sint-Niklaas, where he had [[Anton van Wilderode]] as a teacher. As a young boy he already showed interest in nature and painting. During the war his father earned a living making paintings that he sold to the local farmers or exchanged for food. For a while he studied [[law]] and [[philology]] at the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1955, together with [[Hugues C. Pernath]], he founded the avant-garde journal the ''Gard Sivik'' (civil guard).\n\n==Career==\nAfter his military service in [[Germany]] (1956\u20131957) he decided to become a full-time artist, yet he soon changed his mind. He started working in his father's textile factory and visited several countries as a salesman. In 1963, he founded his own import - and export company of Japanese printed silk. Afterwards he became sales director in a company specialized in pile foundations. In 1967 he bought a farm in [[Slijpe]] and started to paint again in 1972, this time with more success. Several exhibitions followed. His paintings sold so well that he started working part-time for Atlas and then, in 1975, fully committed himself to painting.

He was a son of Omer William Schietekat, a textile manufacturer, and Paula Sylvia Snoeck. In 1961, he married Maria Magdalena Vereecke (Myl\u00e8ne), and together they had three children, a twin Jan and Paul in 1963 and in 1966 [[Sophie]]. He died in a car accident in [[Pittem|Egem]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAt the Nuns Catholic School in Berkenboom he was considered a mediocre student. He went to high school at the ''Sint-Lievenscollege'' in [[Antwerp]] and the ''Sint-Jozef Klein Seminarie'' in Sint-Niklaas, where he had [[Anton van Wilderode]] as a teacher. As a young boy he already showed interest in nature and painting. During the war his father earned a living making paintings that he sold to the local farmers or exchanged for food. For a while he studied [[law]] and [[philology]] at the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1955, together with [[Hugues C. Pernath]], he founded the avant-garde journal the ''Gard Sivik'' (civil guard).\n\n==Career==\nAfter his military service in [[Germany]] (1956\u20131957) he decided to become a full-time artist, yet he soon changed his mind. He started working in his father's textile factory and visited several countries as a salesman. In 1963, he founded his own import - and export company of Japanese printed silk. Afterwards he became sales director in a company specialized in pile foundations. In 1967 he bought a farm in [[Slijpe]] and started to paint again in 1972, this time with more success. Several exhibitions followed. His paintings sold so well that he started working part-time for Atlas and then, in 1975, fully committed himself to painting. Paul Snoek became an editor of the ''Nieuw Vlaams Tijdschrift''. In his free time he collected antiques and was an amateur [[motocross]] rider. He was a close friend of [[Gaston Burssens]].\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord]] 1963.\n* ''Driejaarlijkse Staatsprijs voor de Vlaamse po\u00ebzie'' 1969 for ''De zwarte muze''.\n* ''Jan Campert-prijs'' 1971.\n* ''Eug\u00e8ne Baie-prijs'' 1972.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Paul Snoek - Een zwemmer is een ruiter.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Poem by Paul Snoek in swimming pool 'De Zijl' in [[Leiden]]]]\n* ''Archipel'' (poetry, 1954)\n* ''Noodbrug'' (poetry, 1955)\n* ''Tussen vel en vlees'' (poetry, 1956)\n* ''Aardrijkskunde'' (poetry, 1956)\n* ''Reptielen en amfibie\u00ebn'' (prose, 1957)\n* ''Ik rook een vredespijp'' (poetry, 1957)\n* ''De heilige gedichten'' (poetry, 1959)\n* ''Hercules'' (poetry, 1960)\n* ''Richelieu'' (poetry, 1961)\n* ''Soldatenbrieven'' (prose, together with Hugues C.

As a teenager, she experimented with drugs and ended up living in several care homes after she ran away from her family at the age of fourteen. Anouk's interest in music was triggered through her mother, who was a blues singer. Anouk gave her first performance at fifteen and sang at weddings and parties with the band Shotgun Wedding. She started attending the [[Codarts|Rotterdam Conservatory]] in 1994 but dropped out two years later. In the same period, her then-husband and manager [[Edwin Jansen]] introduced Anouk to [[Golden Earring]] frontman [[Barry Hay]]. Hay believed her to have talent and offered to write some songs for her. One of those songs was \"Mood Indigo\"; written in collaboration with fellow Golden Earring member [[George Kooymans]].\n\nAfter she met [[Bart van Veen]], her co-writer, the pair wrote a few songs. On 5 September 1997, she released her second single, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", which remained at the top of the Dutch music charts for a number of weeks and was also a hit in Norway and Sweden. Her debut album ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'' turned out to be a huge success. In 1998, Anouk won two awards from Dutch music channel [[The Music Factory|TMF]] in addition to an [[Edison Award]]. During the summer, she played at various festivals. Her second album ''[[Urban Solitude]]'' was released in November 1999, and included the single \"[[R U Kiddin' Me]]\". This song reached the Dutch Top 100. Shortly afterwards, Anouk went to the United States to pursue a record deal. Negotiations with her American [[record producer|label]] (Sony) ended badly, causing her to return to the Netherlands without a deal. She released a new song, \"[[Don't (Anouk song)|Don't]]\", and began touring the Netherlands in February 2001.\n\n[[File:Anouk op Lowlands 2006.jpg|thumb|Anouk at [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands festival]] in 2006]]\nIn March 2001, she released another album, ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', which contained acoustic versions and B-sides from older songs, and various duets with [[K's Choice]] singer [[Sam Bettens]] and [[Remon Stotijn|The Anonymous Mis]]. She was awarded the [[Popprijs]] award in 2001. In November 2002, the album ''[[Graduated Fool]]'' was released. This is the heaviest rock album in Anouk's career so far.\nAnouk received a [[Golden Harp]] in 2003. The following full-length release is called ''[[Hotel New York]]'' (2004) and yielded a total of four singles: \"Girl\", \"Lost\", \"Jerusalem\" and \"One Word\".

As a teenager, she experimented with drugs and ended up living in several care homes after she ran away from her family at the age of fourteen. Anouk's interest in music was triggered through her mother, who was a blues singer. Anouk gave her first performance at fifteen and sang at weddings and parties with the band Shotgun Wedding. She started attending the [[Codarts|Rotterdam Conservatory]] in 1994 but dropped out two years later. In the same period, her then-husband and manager [[Edwin Jansen]] introduced Anouk to [[Golden Earring]] frontman [[Barry Hay]]. Hay believed her to have talent and offered to write some songs for her. One of those songs was \"Mood Indigo\"; written in collaboration with fellow Golden Earring member [[George Kooymans]].\n\nAfter she met [[Bart van Veen]], her co-writer, the pair wrote a few songs. On 5 September 1997, she released her second single, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", which remained at the top of the Dutch music charts for a number of weeks and was also a hit in Norway and Sweden. Her debut album ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'' turned out to be a huge success. In 1998, Anouk won two awards from Dutch music channel [[The Music Factory|TMF]] in addition to an [[Edison Award]]. During the summer, she played at various festivals. Her second album ''[[Urban Solitude]]'' was released in November 1999, and included the single \"[[R U Kiddin' Me]]\". This song reached the Dutch Top 100. Shortly afterwards, Anouk went to the United States to pursue a record deal. Negotiations with her American [[record producer|label]] (Sony) ended badly, causing her to return to the Netherlands without a deal. She released a new song, \"[[Don't (Anouk song)|Don't]]\", and began touring the Netherlands in February 2001.\n\n[[File:Anouk op Lowlands 2006.jpg|thumb|Anouk at [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands festival]] in 2006]]\nIn March 2001, she released another album, ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', which contained acoustic versions and B-sides from older songs, and various duets with [[K's Choice]] singer [[Sam Bettens]] and [[Remon Stotijn|The Anonymous Mis]]. She was awarded the [[Popprijs]] award in 2001. In November 2002, the album ''[[Graduated Fool]]'' was released. This is the heaviest rock album in Anouk's career so far.\nAnouk received a [[Golden Harp]] in 2003. The following full-length release is called ''[[Hotel New York]]'' (2004) and yielded a total of four singles: \"Girl\", \"Lost\", \"Jerusalem\" and \"One Word\". In 2006 she won the [[3FM]] award for best Dutch female singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blikopnieuws.nl/bericht/21448|title=Racoon grote winnaar bij 3FM Awards|date=13 March 2006|publisher=Blik op Nieuws|accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> In 2007, Anouk released ''[[Who's Your Momma]]'', recorded with producer [[Glen Ballard]].
