Garland appeared in 34 feature films. She was nominated for multiple [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]], receiving an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] and one Golden Globe. Her film career was interrupted in 1951 after she was cast in a series of films she was unable to complete, but she returned to the screen in 1954 in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' and continued to appear in films until 1963.\n\nAlthough Garland appeared in concert as early as 1943, it was only when her film career stalled that she began regular concert appearances, beginning with a critically acclaimed 1951 concert series at the [[London Palladium]]. Garland set a record when she appeared for 19 weeks at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, also in 1951, and her 1961 concert ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' is often considered as one of the greatest nights in show business history. She continued to tour until just three months prior to her death in 1969.\n\nGarland starred in a series of television specials beginning in 1955, when she appeared in the first episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. The success of these specials led CBS to offer Garland a regular series. ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' premiered in 1963. Although the show was critically well-received, it suffered in the [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen ratings]] from being scheduled across from ''[[Bonanza]]'', which was then the most popular show on the air. ''The Judy Garland Show'' was canceled after one season but Garland and the series were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n[[File:Judy Garland in A Star is Born trailer.jpg|thumb|Judy Garland as Vicki Lester in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'']]\n[[File:Judygarland astarisborn warnerbros publicitystill 19542.jpg|thumb|right|Gatland in a 1954 publicity still]] \n[[File:Judy Garland in Presenting Lily Mars.jpg|thumb|Garland given the Hollywood \"glamor treatment\" for her role in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Garland in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]\n[[File:Meet Me In St Louis Judy Garland Margaret O'Brien 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Garland with [[Margaret O'Brien]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Garland performing \"The Trolley Song\" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Judgement at Nuremberg trailer.jpg|thumb|Garland as Mrs. Wallner in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'']]\n\n===Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Pigskin Parade]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1936\n| Sairy Dodd\n| Film  debut\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Betty Clayton\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Cricket West\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Everybody Sing]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Judy Bellaire\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Listen, Darling]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| \"Pinkie\" Wingate\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| [[Dorothy Gale]]\n| rowspan=2| Garland was honored with an [[Academy Juvenile Award]]{{efn|\"for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year\" for ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.<ref name = tvguide>{{cite web\n  | title =Judy Garland: Biography\n  | publisher =TV Guide\n  | url =http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/judy-garland/bio/159192\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-03 }}</ref>}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| Patsy Barton\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Mary Holden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Nellie Noonan Kelly / Little Nellie Kelly\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Susan Gallagher\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Betsy Booth\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes on Broadway]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Penny Morris\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1942}}\n| Jo Hayden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Lily Mars\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thousands Cheer]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Herself\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Ginger Gray\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1944}}\n| Esther Smith\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| Alice Mayberry\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| The Star\n| \"The Great Lady Has An Interview\" segment\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| Susan Bradley\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| [[Marilyn Miller]]\n| Performed \"[[Look for the Silver Lining]]\", \"[[Sunny (musical)#Songs|Sunny]]\" and \"[[Who?

Garland appeared in 34 feature films. She was nominated for multiple [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]], receiving an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] and one Golden Globe. Her film career was interrupted in 1951 after she was cast in a series of films she was unable to complete, but she returned to the screen in 1954 in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' and continued to appear in films until 1963.\n\nAlthough Garland appeared in concert as early as 1943, it was only when her film career stalled that she began regular concert appearances, beginning with a critically acclaimed 1951 concert series at the [[London Palladium]]. Garland set a record when she appeared for 19 weeks at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, also in 1951, and her 1961 concert ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' is often considered as one of the greatest nights in show business history. She continued to tour until just three months prior to her death in 1969.\n\nGarland starred in a series of television specials beginning in 1955, when she appeared in the first episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. The success of these specials led CBS to offer Garland a regular series. ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' premiered in 1963. Although the show was critically well-received, it suffered in the [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen ratings]] from being scheduled across from ''[[Bonanza]]'', which was then the most popular show on the air. ''The Judy Garland Show'' was canceled after one season but Garland and the series were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n[[File:Judy Garland in A Star is Born trailer.jpg|thumb|Judy Garland as Vicki Lester in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'']]\n[[File:Judygarland astarisborn warnerbros publicitystill 19542.jpg|thumb|right|Gatland in a 1954 publicity still]] \n[[File:Judy Garland in Presenting Lily Mars.jpg|thumb|Garland given the Hollywood \"glamor treatment\" for her role in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Garland in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]\n[[File:Meet Me In St Louis Judy Garland Margaret O'Brien 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Garland with [[Margaret O'Brien]] in 1944]]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Garland performing \"The Trolley Song\" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'']]\n[[File:Judy Garland in Judgement at Nuremberg trailer.jpg|thumb|Garland as Mrs. Wallner in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'']]\n\n===Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Pigskin Parade]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1936\n| Sairy Dodd\n| Film  debut\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Betty Clayton\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''\n| align=\"center\"| 1937\n| Cricket West\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Everybody Sing]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Judy Bellaire\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Listen, Darling]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1938}}\n| \"Pinkie\" Wingate\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| [[Dorothy Gale]]\n| rowspan=2| Garland was honored with an [[Academy Juvenile Award]]{{efn|\"for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year\" for ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.<ref name = tvguide>{{cite web\n  | title =Judy Garland: Biography\n  | publisher =TV Guide\n  | url =http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/judy-garland/bio/159192\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-03 }}</ref>}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1939}}\n| Patsy Barton\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Betsy Booth\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Mary Holden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1940}}\n| Nellie Noonan Kelly / Little Nellie Kelly\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Susan Gallagher\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Betsy Booth\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Babes on Broadway]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1941}}\n| Penny Morris\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1942}}\n| Jo Hayden\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Lily Mars\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Thousands Cheer]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Herself\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1943}}\n| Ginger Gray\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1944}}\n| Esther Smith\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| Alice Mayberry\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1945}}\n| The Star\n| \"The Great Lady Has An Interview\" segment\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| Susan Bradley\n| \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''\n| align=\"center\"| {{dts|1946}}\n| [[Marilyn Miller]]\n| Performed \"[[Look for the Silver Lining]]\", \"[[Sunny (musical)#Songs|Sunny]]\" and \"[[Who?

According to the \"Adventures in Odyssey HQ\" website, \"the hiatus\" means the time from December 1996 to September 1997 where no episodes were produced.  The writers, producers, actors, and production engineers needed a break from the daily pressure of the program and after ten years of production decided it was time. Many things have changed from \"old Odyssey\" before the hiatus to \"new Odyssey\" after the hiatus.  None of the children (unless you count Rodney Rathbone) from old Odyssey have been carried over to new Odyssey.  Nearly all of the storylines from old Odyssey were finished off in the final album of that era (Welcome Home) and the show has in general had a different \"flavor\" than before.\"<ref>http://www.aiohq.com/articles/faq.htm#hiatus</ref>\n\n===Season 10 (1997\u201398)===\n*372: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 1\"\n*373: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 2\"\n*374: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 3\"\n*375: \"The Pushover\"\n*376: \"Chores No More\"\n*377: \"Just Say Yes\"\n*378: \"The Painting\"\n*379: \"Best Face Forward\"\n*380: \"The One About Trust, Part 1\"\n*381: \"The One About Trust, Part 2\"\n*382: \"Viva La Difference\"\n*383: \"BTV: Thanks\"\n*384: \"Amazing Grace\"\n*385: \"It's a Pokenberry Christmas, Part 1\"\n*386: \"It's a Pokenberry Christmas, Part 2\"\n*387: \"New Year's Eve Live!\" (This episode was recorded before a live audience at Focus on the Family Headquarters.)\n*388: \"Leap of Faith\"\n*389: \"O.T.

The 3rd album release (#2) would have featured the episodes starting with the 19th episode \"Recollections\" and ending around the 30th episode \"Honor Thy Parents\", but it was shelved when the controversy surrounding the character Officer David Harley (voiced by veteran voice actor [[Will Ryan]]) occurred. The following album, ''Grins, Grabbers, and Great Getaways'' (1988) was then released, continuing where the unreleased album would have left off. After those releases, future albums no longer followed the exact chronological order, and starting with the 5th album release, ''Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes'' (1989), many episodes were often edited to remove references to product promotions and upcoming episodes. The original 1987 four-cassette package containing all the episodes of ''Family Portraits'', the test pilot series, was later phased out, and the 1st album release was re-released several times, first with simply a title change and the same tapes, and in 1992 with all references to the Officer Harley character and ''Odyssey USA'' removed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n*'''''Family Portraits''''' (1987)\n*'''''The Lost Episodes''''' (2007)\n*'''''The Office Harley Collection''''' (2014)\n* 1: ''Odyssey USA'' (1988) / Re-titled ''Adventures in Odyssey'' (1989) and later replaced by ''The Early Classics'' (1992), presently '''''The Adventure Begins'''''\n* 2: 'HELLO\n'''''\n* 10: '''''Other Times . . .

Starting in 2003, [[Focus on the Family]] updated and re-released those albums as part of the Gold Audio series. In the process, these albums, which were digitally remastered, were released on compact disc for the first time. Not only did these releases contained remastered episodes, but they also contained behind-the-scenes material from the cast and crew as bonus features. In addition, a small number of episodes that never appeared in the original cassette albums made their debut in the discs.\n\nAs mentioned above, all episodes that originally contained Officer Harley have been replaced with edited versions of the original episodes or with other unrelated episodes, carrying over the changes first made in ''The Early Classics'' when it was released in 1992. The openings to many episodes have been removed or replaced, sometimes with newly recorded openings with Whit voiced by [[Paul Herlinger]] rather than [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]]. Other changes include the reordering of the episodes (or, in the case of albums 12 and 13, entire albums) to make the chronological listening experience more accurate, and the removal of references to cassettes at the end of multi-part episodes (e.g., \"For the rest of the adventure, please turn over the tape.\"). The changes are most noticeable in the chronologically earliest albums, while albums 8 onwards feature comparatively fewer changes. Most albums were also renamed, by suggestions from listeners as well other means. Re-releases of these albums have dropped the Gold Audio label.\n\nThe sixteenth album, ''The Lost Episodes'', contained an additional 17 episodes that were not included in any of the other Gold Audio releases.

According to the \"Adventures in Odyssey HQ\" website, \"the hiatus\" means the time from December 1996 to September 1997 where no episodes were produced.  The writers, producers, actors, and production engineers needed a break from the daily pressure of the program and after ten years of production decided it was time. Many things have changed from \"old Odyssey\" before the hiatus to \"new Odyssey\" after the hiatus.  None of the children (unless you count Rodney Rathbone) from old Odyssey have been carried over to new Odyssey.  Nearly all of the storylines from old Odyssey were finished off in the final album of that era (Welcome Home) and the show has in general had a different \"flavor\" than before.\"<ref>http://www.aiohq.com/articles/faq.htm#hiatus</ref>\n\n===Season 10 (1997\u201398)===\n*372: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 1\"\n*373: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 2\"\n*374: \"For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll, Part 3\"\n*375: \"The Pushover\"\n*376: \"Chores No More\"\n*377: \"Just Say Yes\"\n*378: \"The Painting\"\n*379: \"Best Face Forward\"\n*380: \"The One About Trust, Part 1\"\n*381: \"The One About Trust, Part 2\"\n*382: \"Viva La Difference\"\n*383: \"BTV: Thanks\"\n*384: \"Amazing Grace\"\n*385: \"It's a Pokenberry Christmas, Part 1\"\n*386: \"It's a Pokenberry Christmas, Part 2\"\n*387: \"New Year's Eve Live!\" (This episode was recorded before a live audience at Focus on the Family Headquarters.)\n*388: \"Leap of Faith\"\n*389: \"O.T.

The 3rd album release (#2) would have featured the episodes starting with the 19th episode \"Recollections\" and ending around the 30th episode \"Honor Thy Parents\", but it was shelved when the controversy surrounding the character Officer David Harley (voiced by veteran voice actor [[Will Ryan]]) occurred. The following album, ''Grins, Grabbers, and Great Getaways'' (1988) was then released, continuing where the unreleased album would have left off. After those releases, future albums no longer followed the exact chronological order, and starting with the 5th album release, ''Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes'' (1989), many episodes were often edited to remove references to product promotions and upcoming episodes. The original 1987 four-cassette package containing all the episodes of ''Family Portraits'', the test pilot series, was later phased out, and the 1st album release was re-released several times, first with simply a title change and the same tapes, and in 1992 with all references to the Officer Harley character and ''Odyssey USA'' removed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n*'''''Family Portraits''''' (1987)\n*'''''The Lost Episodes''''' (2007)\n*'''''The Office Harley Collection''''' (2014)\n* 1: ''Odyssey USA'' (1988) / Re-titled ''Adventures in Odyssey'' (1989) and later replaced by ''The Early Classics'' (1992), presently '''''The Adventure Begins'''''\n* 2: ''Grins, Grabbers, and Great Getaways'' (1988), later \"Stormy Weather,\" presently '''''The Wildest Summer Ever'''''\n* 3: ''Secrets, Surprises, and Sensational Stories'' (1988), presently '''''Heroes'''''\n* 4: ''Puns, Parables, and Perilous Predicaments'' (1989), presently '''''FUN-damentals'''''\n* 5: '''''Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes''''' (1989)\n* 6: ''Terrific Tales, Mysterious Missions'' (1990), presently '''''Mission Accomplished'''''\n* 7: ''Courageous Characters, Fabulous Friends'' (1990), presently '''''On Thin Ice'''''\n* 8: ''Cunning Capers, Exciting Escapades'' (1991), presently '''''Beyond Expectations'''''\n* 9: ''Amazing Antics, Dynamic Discoveries'' (1991), presently '''''Just in Time'''''\n* 10: '''''Other Times . . .

In the process, these albums, which were digitally remastered, were released on compact disc for the first time. Not only did these releases contained remastered episodes, but they also contained behind-the-scenes material from the cast and crew as bonus features. In addition, a small number of episodes that never appeared in the original cassette albums made their debut in the discs.\n\nAs mentioned above, all episodes that originally contained Officer Harley have been replaced with edited versions of the original episodes or with other unrelated episodes, carrying over the changes first made in ''The Early Classics'' when it was released in 1992. The openings to many episodes have been removed or replaced, sometimes with newly recorded openings with Whit voiced by [[Paul Herlinger]] rather than [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]]. Other changes include the reordering of the episodes (or, in the case of albums 12 and 13, entire albums) to make the chronological listening experience more accurate, and the removal of references to cassettes at the end of multi-part episodes (e.g., \"For the rest of the adventure, please turn over the tape.\"). The changes are most noticeable in the chronologically earliest albums, while albums 8 onwards feature comparatively fewer changes. Most albums were also renamed, by suggestions from listeners as well other means. Re-releases of these albums have dropped the Gold Audio label.\n\nThe sixteenth album, ''The Lost Episodes'', contained an additional 17 episodes that were not included in any of the other Gold Audio releases. Most of these episodes were previously available as individual cassettes from Focus on the Family.\n\n*0: ''The Lost Episodes'' [https://store.focusonthefamily.com/the-lost-episodes CD]\n*1: ''The Adventure Begins: The Early Classics'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006060445/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4009 AC] [https://web.archive.org/web/20051005222115/http://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4010 CD]\n*2: ''Stormy Weather: and Other Grins, Grabbers & Great Getaways'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006022412/http://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4012 CD]\n*3: ''Heroes: and Other Secrets, Surprises and Sensational Stories'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006064356/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4268 CD]\n*4: ''FUN-damentals: Puns, Parables and Perilous Predicaments'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006065201/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4496 CD]\n*5: ''Daring Deeds, Sinister Schemes'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006071242/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=4498 CD]\n*6: ''Mission: Accomplished'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006014438/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=5100 CD]\n*7: ''On Thin Ice'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006045558/http://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=5101 CD]\n*8: ''Beyond Expectations'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006055630/https://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=5102 CD]\n*9: ''Just in Time'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051006022422/http://www.family.org/resources/itempg.cfm?itemid=5398 CD]\n*10: ''Other Times . . .
