It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song's initial concept was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then found in a notebook.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album.

Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself.

Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)'s [[nationalist government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] recently holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|18th Central Committee]] held on 15 November 2012.\n\nThe CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], and [[Xi Jinping Thought]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The [[command economy]] established under [[Mao Zedong]] was replaced by the [[socialist market economy]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[Economy of China|current economic system]], on the basis that \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\".\n\nSince the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Eastern European communist governments]] in 1989\u20131990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining [[socialist state]]s. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling [[communist parties]] around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of [[one-party states]] (whatever their ideology), [[Dominant-party system|dominant parties]] in [[democracies]] (whatever their ideology) and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Communist Party of China}}\n\n=== Founding and early history (1921\u20131927) ===\n[[File:The First National Congress of CPC.jpg|thumb|[[Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party|Site of the first CPC congress]], in the former [[Shanghai French Concession]]]]\n\nThe CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, during which radical Western ideologies like [[Marxism]] and [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] gained traction among [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectuals]].<ref name=\"XinhuaCCPhistory\" /> Other influences stemming from the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist theory inspired the Communist Party of China.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |location= |page = 114 }}</ref> [[Li Dazhao]] was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported [[Leninism]] and [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=26}} In contrast to [[Chen Duxiu]], Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} Both of them regarded the [[October Revolution]] in Russia as groundbreaking, believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} The CPC was modeled on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|pp=34\u201338}} Study circles were, according to [[Cai Hesen]], \"the rudiments [of our party]\".{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=38}} Several study circles were established during the [[New Culture Movement]], but \"by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread.\"{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=44}}\n\nThe [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|founding National Congress]] of the CPC was held on 23\u201331 July 1921.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/cpc_1st_congress_standing_polibureau.htm |title=1st.

live }}</ref> In recent years, noting the self-reform of the European social democratic movement in the 1980s and 1990s, the CPC \"has noted the increased marginalization of West European communist parties.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=100}}\n\n==== Ruling parties of socialist states ====\nThe CPC has retained close relations with the remaining [[socialist state]]s still espousing [[communism]]: [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] and their respective ruling parties as well as [[North Korea]] and its ruling party, which officially abandoned communism in 2009.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=81}} It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern European socialist states]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}}\n\nThe ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post-Soviet era.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the [[Doi Moi]] reform policy at the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th CPV National Congress]] is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}}\n\nWhile the CPC is probably the organization with [[China-North Korea relations|most access to North Korea]], writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} The few reports accessible to the general public are those about [[North Korean economic reform]]s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea's economic system]], the [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of personality]] which pervades society, the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the [[Korean People's Army]] and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=82\u201383}} There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK general secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] to [[North China Plain|Guandong province]] to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}}\n\nThere is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the [[Cuban Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[China-Cuba relations|Communication between the CPC and the PCC]] has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=85}} At the 4th Plenary Session of the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|16th Central Committee]], which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008 |p=85}} When [[Wu Guanzheng]], a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: \"Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity. The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n=== Non-communist parties ===\nSince the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86\u201392}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its \"low-key presence, but total control.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its \"well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, \"that it is not a political party based on the working class\u2014instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] (1957-2018), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] since 1955.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nThe CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}\n[[File:Cena de Estado que en honor del Excmo.

founding and [[Ruling party|ruling political party]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[List of largest political parties|second largest political party in the world]]. The CPC is the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] within [[mainland China]], [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|permitting only eight other]], subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]]. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)'s [[nationalist government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] recently holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|18th Central Committee]] held on 15 November 2012.\n\nThe CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], and [[Xi Jinping Thought]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The [[command economy]] established under [[Mao Zedong]] was replaced by the [[socialist market economy]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[Economy of China|current economic system]], on the basis that \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\".\n\nSince the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Eastern European communist governments]] in 1989\u20131990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining [[socialist state]]s. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling [[communist parties]] around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of [[one-party states]] (whatever their ideology), [[Dominant-party system|dominant parties]] in [[democracies]] (whatever their ideology) and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Communist Party of China}}\n\n=== Founding and early history (1921\u20131927) ===\n[[File:The First National Congress of CPC.jpg|thumb|[[Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party|Site of the first CPC congress]], in the former [[Shanghai French Concession]]]]\n\nThe CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, during which radical Western ideologies like [[Marxism]] and [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] gained traction among [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectuals]].<ref name=\"XinhuaCCPhistory\" /> Other influences stemming from the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist theory inspired the Communist Party of China.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |location= |page = 114 }}</ref> [[Li Dazhao]] was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported [[Leninism]] and [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=26}} In contrast to [[Chen Duxiu]], Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} Both of them regarded the [[October Revolution]] in Russia as groundbreaking, believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} The CPC was modeled on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|pp=34\u201338}} Study circles were, according to [[Cai Hesen]], \"the rudiments [of our party]\".{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=38}} Several study circles were established during the [[New Culture Movement]], but \"by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread.\"{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=44}}\n\nThe [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|founding National Congress]] of the CPC was held on 23\u201331 July 1921.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/cpc_1st_congress_standing_polibureau.htm |title=1st.

A battalion led by General [[Zhu De]] was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the [[Nanchang uprising]]; initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Shantou]], and from there being driven into the wilderness of [[Fujian]].{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=63}} [[Mao Zedong]] was appointed commander-in-chief of the Red Army, and led four regiments against Changsha in the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]], hoping to spark peasant uprisings across Hunan.{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=64}} His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on 9 September, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment.

From 1945 until 1949, the war had been reduced to two parties; the CPC and the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} This period lasted through four stages; the first was from August 1945 (when the Japanese surrendered) to June 1946 (when the peace talks between the CPC and the KMT ended).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} By 1945, the KMT had three-times more soldiers under its command than the CPC and initially appeared to be prevailing.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} With the cooperation of the Americans and the Japanese, the KMT was able to retake major parts of the country.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} However, KMT rule over the reconquered territories would prove unpopular because of endemic party corruption.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} Notwithstanding its huge numerical superiority, the KMT failed to reconquer the rural territories which made up the CPC's stronghold.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} Around the same time, the CPC launched an invasion of [[Manchuria]], where they were assisted by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} The second stage, lasting from July 1946 to June 1947, saw the KMT extend its control over major cities, such as [[Yan'an]] (the CPC headquarters for much of the war).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} The KMT's successes were hollow; the CPC had tactically withdrawn from the cities, and instead attacked KMT authorities by instigating protests amongst students and intellectuals in the cities (the KMT responded to these events with heavy-handed repression).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} In the meantime, the KMT was struggling with factional infighting and Chiang Kai-shek's autocratic control over the party, which weakened the KMT's ability to respond to attacks.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The third stage, lasting from July 1947 to August 1948, saw a limited counteroffensive by the CPC.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The objective was clearing \"Central China, strengthening North China, and recovering Northeast China.\"{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} This policy, coupled with desertions from the KMT military force (by the spring of 1948, the KMT military had lost an estimated 2 of its 3 million troops) and declining popularity of KMT rule.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The result was that the CPC was able to cut off KMT garrisons in [[Manchuria]] and retake several lost territories.{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} The last stage, lasting from September 1948 to December 1949, saw the communists take the initiative and the collapse of KMT rule in mainland China as a whole.{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} On 1 October 1949, Mao declared the establishment of the PRC, which signified the end of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] (as it is officially described by the CPC).{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}}\n\n=== Single ruling party (1949\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Flag of the Chinese Communist Party (Pre-1996).svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Communist Party of China from 17 June 1951 to 21 July 1996.]]\nOn 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the 21 September 1949 establishment of the PRC before a massive crowd at Beijing Square.

live }}</ref> In recent years, noting the self-reform of the European social democratic movement in the 1980s and 1990s, the CPC \"has noted the increased marginalization of West European communist parties.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=100}}\n\n==== Ruling parties of socialist states ====\nThe CPC has retained close relations with the remaining [[socialist state]]s still espousing [[communism]]: [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] and their respective ruling parties as well as [[North Korea]] and its ruling party, which officially abandoned communism in 2009.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=81}} It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern European socialist states]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}}\n\nThe ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post-Soviet era.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the [[Doi Moi]] reform policy at the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th CPV National Congress]] is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}}\n\nWhile the CPC is probably the organization with [[China-North Korea relations|most access to North Korea]], writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} The few reports accessible to the general public are those about [[North Korean economic reform]]s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea's economic system]], the [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of personality]] which pervades society, the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the [[Korean People's Army]] and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=82\u201383}} There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK general secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] to [[North China Plain|Guandong province]] to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}}\n\nThere is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the [[Cuban Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[China-Cuba relations|Communication between the CPC and the PCC]] has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=85}} At the 4th Plenary Session of the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|16th Central Committee]], which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008 |p=85}} When [[Wu Guanzheng]], a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: \"Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity. The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n=== Non-communist parties ===\nSince the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86\u201392}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its \"low-key presence, but total control.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its \"well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, \"that it is not a political party based on the working class\u2014instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] (1957-2018), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] since 1955.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nThe CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}\n[[File:Cena de Estado que en honor del Excmo.

Her maternal grandfather Demetrio Corgialegno (1785\u20131861), who had settled in Florence, came from an old and rich [[Byzantine]] noble family. He fought alongside the poet, [[Lord Byron|Lord George Byron]], during the Greek war of independence. He established a secret organisation aimed at overthrowing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule based in both [[Corfu]] and his home town, Argostoli. Later, between 1838 and 1842, owing to his Tuscan connections, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, [[Grand duke of Tuscany Leopold II|Leopoldo II]], gifted to him large quantities of books for the newly founded [[University of Athens]].<ref name=\"Delcorno Giovanna\">{{cite book|last=Delcorno|first=Giovanna|title=Maria Sara Goretti, la sua vita, i suoi libri|year=2005|publisher=L'Archiginnsio|pages=519\u2013540}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871 Goretti's future father, Torello Ancillotti (1843\u20131899)  married her mother Marianna Coriaglegno,<ref>{{cite web |title=Torello Ancillotti |url=http://www.enricogallerie.com/artista/ancillotti-torello-653.asp |website=enricogallerie.com}}</ref>  known in the family as Demetria or Memi, with whom he would have two other children,  Luisa, who died aged nine,  and Demetrio apart from Beatrice. Torello Ancillotti  had met his wife through his friend and the son of Demetrio Corgialegno, Carlo, when, in 1859, they had both joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] during Italy's [[Third Italian War of Independence|Third War of Independence]]. Awarded a silver medal for bravery during the conflict, when he returned to Florence, he was employed by  the National Library of Florence. As a youth, he had studied at both the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] and that of Siena. He continued to paint, influenced greatly by the  [[Macchiaioli]], and in 1876 and 1877 held exhibitions in both Genoa and Turin.<ref name=\"Maria Goretti\">{{cite book|last=Goretti|first=Maria|title=Omaggio a Torello Ancillotti|year=1989|publisher=Pizzoli|location=Bologna}}</ref>\n\nLeaving his family behind in Florence, in 1877, Torello Ancillotti moved to Rouen in France where, during a liaison with the Countess of Barr, he began an intense and successful period of artistic activity as a painter, water colourist and sculptor. \n\n==Relationship with painter Giovanni Costetti==\nFollowing in her father's footsteps, Goretti attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence before taking advanced classes at [[Giovanni Fattori]]'s Free School of the Nude. It was there that she probably met and started a love affair with fellow student and artist, Giovanni Costetti (1878\u20131949).<ref>{{cite web |title=Biblioteca delle Signorine Salani |url=http://www.letteraturadimenticata.it/Illustratori%20Signorine.htm |website=letteraturadimenticata.it}}</ref>  He painted a portrait of her entitled ''The Good Smile''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/musei/?m=artemoderna |title=Polo Museale Fiorentino :: Sito Ufficiale |work=uffizi.firenze.it |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329071646/http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/musei/?m=artemoderna |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}</ref>  found in the Modern Art Gallery of the Pitti Palace in Florence. In 1899, she also painted a portrait of him that hangs in the same gallery.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn 1901, both artists took part in the 1901 Alinari Divine Comedy Competition, which involved preparing new illustrations for [[Dante]]'s epic poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn 1903 Cosetti challenged a rival artist, [[Augusto Mussini]] (1870\u20131919) to a duel because he had become infatuated with Goretti. When Mussini disappeared from the city, he was feared dead. Instead, he had escaped from Florence to take refuge in a monastery in the north of Italy where he became a monk, although he never pronounced his final vows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://giornale.regione.marche.it/archivio/num10_11_1205/artcom22.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033239/http://giornale.regione.marche.it/archivio/num10_11_1205/artcom22.htm |archive-date=2006-05-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Costetti reported two of Goretti's aunts to the police accusing them of keeping her a recluse. Before leaving Florence after she had ended the affair, she made a statement before a public notary in which she said she had, of her own free will, refused to marry Costetti and strongly denied the rumor that she had been forced into seclusion by her relatives declaring \"I am an adult and no one can impose their will on me\".<ref name=\"Delcorno Giovanna\" />\n\n==Artistic legacy==\nFollowing her departure from Florence, she settled at Stellata, in the [[province of Ferrara]].

Her maternal grandfather Demetrio Corgialegno (1785\u20131861), who had settled in Florence, came from an old and rich [[Byzantine]] noble family. He fought alongside the poet, [[Lord Byron|Lord George Byron]], during the Greek war of independence. He established a secret organisation aimed at overthrowing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule based in both [[Corfu]] and his home town, Argostoli. Later, between 1838 and 1842, owing to his Tuscan connections, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, [[Grand duke of Tuscany Leopold II|Leopoldo II]], gifted to him large quantities of books for the newly founded [[University of Athens]].<ref name=\"Delcorno Giovanna\">{{cite book|last=Delcorno|first=Giovanna|title=Maria Sara Goretti, la sua vita, i suoi libri|year=2005|publisher=L'Archiginnsio|pages=519\u2013540}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871 Goretti's future father, Torello Ancillotti (1843\u20131899)  married her mother Marianna Coriaglegno,<ref>{{cite web |title=Torello Ancillotti |url=http://www.enricogallerie.com/artista/ancillotti-torello-653.asp |website=enricogallerie.com}}</ref>  known in the family as Demetria or Memi, with whom he would have two other children,  Luisa, who died aged nine,  and Demetrio apart from Beatrice. Torello Ancillotti  had met his wife through his friend and the son of Demetrio Corgialegno, Carlo, when, in 1859, they had both joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] during Italy's [[Third Italian War of Independence|Third War of Independence]]. Awarded a silver medal for bravery during the conflict, when he returned to Florence, he was employed by  the National Library of Florence. As a youth he had studied at both the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] and that of Siena. He continued to paint, influenced greatly by the  [[Macchiaioli]], and in 1876 and 1877 held exhibitions in both Genoa and Turin.<ref name=\"Maria Goretti\">{{cite book|last=Goretti|first=Maria|title=Omaggio a Torello Ancillotti|year=1989|publisher=Pizzoli|location=Bologna}}</ref>\n\nLeaving his family behind in Florence, in 1877, Torello Ancillotti moved to Rouen in France where, during a liaison with the Countess of Barr, he began an intense and successful period of artistic activity as a painter, water colourist and sculptor. \n\n==Relationship with painter Giovanni Costetti==\nFollowing in her father's footsteps, Goretti attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence before taking advanced classes at [[Giovanni Fattori]]'s Free School of the Nude. It was there that she probably met and started a love affair with fellow student and artist, Giovanni Costetti (1878\u20131949).<ref>{{cite web |title=Biblioteca delle Signorine Salani |url=http://www.letteraturadimenticata.it/Illustratori%20Signorine.htm |website=letteraturadimenticata.it}}</ref>  He painted a portrait of her entitled ''The Good Smile''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/musei/?m=artemoderna |title=Polo Museale Fiorentino :: Sito Ufficiale |work=uffizi.firenze.it |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329071646/http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/musei/?m=artemoderna |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}</ref>  found in the Modern Art Gallery of the Pitti Palace in Florence.

When Mussini disappeared from the city, he was feared dead. Instead, he had escaped from Florence to take refuge in a monastery in the north of Italy where he became a monk, although he never pronounced his final vows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://giornale.regione.marche.it/archivio/num10_11_1205/artcom22.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033239/http://giornale.regione.marche.it/archivio/num10_11_1205/artcom22.htm |archive-date=2006-05-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Costetti reported two of Goretti's aunts to the police accusing them of keeping her a recluse. Before leaving Florence after she had ended the affair, she made a statement before a public notary in which she said she had, of her own free will, refused to marry Costetti and strongly denied the rumor that she had been forced into seclusion by her relatives declaring \"I am an adult and no one can impose their will on me\".<ref name=\"Delcorno Giovanna\" />\n\n==Artistic legacy==\nFollowing her departure from Florence, she settled at Stellata, in the [[province of Ferrara]].

For instance, [[Bach's Nekrolog|his obituary]] contains a list of the instrumental [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime|compositions printed during the composer's lifetime]], followed by an approximate list of his unpublished work.{{sfn|Bach|Agricola|1754|pp=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_lfQ4AAAAIAAJ/page/n1045/mode/2up 167]\u2013[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_lfQ4AAAAIAAJ/page/n1047/mode/2up 169]}} The [[Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work|first separately published biography of the composer]], by [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]], follows the same approach: its ninth chapter first lists printed works (adding [[18th-century prints of Bach's four-part chorales|four-part chorales which had been published in the second half of the 18th century]]), followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones.{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/details/johannsebastian01terrgoog/page/n161/mode/2up \"Chapter IX: Bach's Compositions\" pp.&nbsp;114\u2013142]}} In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies (Schauer and Hilgenfeldt in 1850) had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the [[Prelude and Fugue in E flat major, BWV 552|Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major]] can be indicated as \"[[C. F. Peters]] Vol. III No. 1\", or any of the variants (\"[[Friedrich Konrad Griepenkerl|Griepenkerl]] and Roitzsch Vol. 3 p. 2\", \"Peters Book 242 p. 2\", \"P. S.

G., III., p. 173\" for the above-mentioned Prelude in E-flat major), and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkel's biography.{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up \"Appendix III\" pp.&nbsp;225\u2013286]}}\n\nBut there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bach's works according to [[Novello & Co|Novello]]'s editions, or [[Augener & Co.|Augener]]'s, or [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]]'s,... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bach's compositions (e.g. [https://archive.org/stream/organworksofbach00grac#page/305/mode/1up Harvey Grace's in a 1922 book on Bach's organ compositions]).\n\n====NBG====\nIn 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bach's known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] (NBG), with a new set of goals (Bach yearbook, Bach festivals, and a Bach museum). Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of ''[[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht]]'' was published in NBG XVII<sup>1</sup> in 1916 (the 1730s version of the same piece, with a different orchestration, had been published in BG 24, pp.&nbsp;185\u2013192).{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up \"Appendix III\" pp.&nbsp;225\u2013286]}}\n\n===BWV===\n{{see also|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis}}\nIn 1950 the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach. [[Wolfgang Schmieder]], the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):{{sfn|Schmieder|1950}}\n[[File:Loure bach.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The BWV is a [[thematic catalogue]], thus it identifies every movement of every composition by its first measures, like the opening of [[Partita for Violin No. 3 (Bach)|BWV 1006]], movement 2 (Loure) above.]]\n# [[#BWV Chapter 1|Kantaten (Cantatas)]], BWV 1\u2013224\n# [[#BWV Chapter 2|Motetten (Motets)]], BWV 225\u2013231\n# [[#BWV Chapter 3|Messen, Messens\u00e4tze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat)]], BWV 232\u2013243\n# [[#BWV Chapter 4|Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios)]], BWV 244\u2013249\n# [[#BWV Chapter 5|Vierstimmige Chor\u00e4le (Four-part chorales)]], BWV 250\u2013438\n# [[#BWV Chapter 6|Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet)]], BWV 439\u2013524\n# [[#BWV Chapter 7|Werke f\u00fcr Orgel (Works for organ)]], BWV 525\u2013771\n# [[#BWV Chapter 8|Werke f\u00fcr Klavier (Keyboard compositions)]], BWV 772\u2013994\n# [[#BWV Chapter 9|Werke f\u00fcr Laute (Lute compositions)]], BWV 995\u20131000\n# [[#BWV Chapter 10|Kammermusik (Chamber music)]], BWV 1001\u20131040\n# [[#BWV Chapter 11|Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra)]], BWV 1041\u20131071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041\u20131065) and Overtures (BWV 1066\u20131071)\n# [[#BWV Chapter 12|Kanons (Canons)]], BWV 1072\u20131078\n# [[#BWV Chapter 13|Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue)]], BWV 1079\u20131080\n\nFor instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became [[BWV 552]], situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] for [[Mozart]]'s compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance [[BWV 992]] is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S.&nbsp;225 = [[BWV&nbsp;225]]).<ref>{{OCLC|18856743}}</ref>\n\nAnother consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance [[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]] was partly in the organ compositions range (BWV 552 and 669\u2013689), with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions (BWV 802\u2013805).\n\n====BWV Anh.====\nThe Anhang (Anh.), i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\n* [[#BWV Anhang|I \u2013 lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived]] (Anh. 1\u201323)\n* [[#BWV Anhang II|II \u2013 works of dubious authenticity]] (Anh. 24\u2013155)\n* [[#BWV Anhang III|III \u2013 works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him]] (Anh. 156\u2013189)\nWithin each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.\n\n====BWV<sup>2a</sup>====\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Video Camera Icon.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Minuet-G-Major-BWV-Anh-114.ogv\n| alt         = Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114\n| title       = Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114\n| description = [[Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114]]\n| filename2    = Minuet-G-minor-BWV-Anh-115.ogg\n| title2       = Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115\n| alt2         = Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115\n| description2 = [[Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114|Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115]]<br>Both Minuets were moved from '''[[#BWV Anhang II|Anh.&nbsp;II]]''' (doubtful works) to '''[[#BWV Anhang III|Anh.&nbsp;III]]''' (spurious works) in BWV<sup>2a</sup>, after they were attributed to [[Christian Petzold (composer)|Christian Petzold]].\n}}\nSchmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example, [[BWV 11]], formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted: \"{{nobreak|BWV 11/249b\u2192}}\" meaning \"BWV&nbsp;11, inserted after BWV&nbsp;249b\" (4th chapter). Similarly, {{nobreak|BWV 1083/243a\u2192}} meant [[BWV&nbsp;1083]], inserted after BWV&nbsp;243a (3rd chapter). Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g. \"{{nobreak|BWV Anh. II 114}}\" became \"{{nobreak|Anh. II 114/Anh. III 183\u2192}} indicating it was now considered a spurious work.{{sfn|Schmieder|1990}}\n\nIn 1998 [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]] and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV<sup>2a</sup>, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998}}\n\nNew additions (Nachtr\u00e4ge) to BWV<sup>2</sup>/BWV<sup>2a</sup> included:\n* [[#Additions to the main catalogue (BWV 1081\u20131126)|BWV 1081\u20131126]]\n* [[#Additions to the Anhang (BWV Anh. 190\u2013213)|BWV Anh. 190\u2013213]]\n\nA few exceptions to the principle that compositions weren't renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bach's, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;205 (BWV<sup>2</sup>) \u2192 BWV&nbsp;1121 (BWV<sup>2a</sup>, where it is in section 7 as a work for organ).<ref>{{BDh|1516|0|2019-05-14|Work|Fantasia, c BWV 1121 &#91;BWV 1998&#93;; BWV Anh. 205 / Anh. II 45&rarr;}}</ref>\n\nOther renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:\n* [[BWV 243a]]: 1723 E{{flat}} major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major [[BWV 243]]\n* [[BWV 1071]] renumbered to [[BWV 1046a]] (early version of the [[BWV 1046|first ''Brandenburg Concerto'']])\n* [[BWV Anh. 198]] renumbered to [[BWV 149/1a]] (earlier abandoned version of the opening movement of Cantata [[BWV&nbsp;149]])\n\nSome versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g. [[BWV 655b]] and [[BWV 655c|c]]\n\nSlashes indicate movements: e.g. [[BWV&nbsp;149]]/1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV&nbsp;149. Another example: the [[Mass in B minor structure#Agnus Dei|Agnus Dei]] of the [[Mass in B minor]] can be indicated as BWV&nbsp;232/22 (22nd movement of the composition), or alternatively as BWV&nbsp;232<sup>IV</sup>/4 (BWV 232, fourth movement of Part IV).\n\n====21st-century additions====\n[[#21st century (BWV 1127 and higher)|Numbers above BWV 1126]] were added in the 21st century.\n\n====Reconstructed versions====\nAn upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a [[#Reconstructions|reconstructed version]], that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 (Supplement) p.&nbsp;75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as [[BWV 1060R]].\n\n====BWV<sup>3</sup>====\nAs of mid-2018 the [[#BD|Bach digital]] website started to implement the new numbers of the 3rd edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, which has been announced for publication in 2020.{{sfn|Blanken|2019}} For example, the Leipzig version of the [[BWV 4|''Christ lag in Todes Banden'' cantata]] used to be BWV&nbsp;4 in previous versions of the catalogue, and, in BWV<sup>3</sup>, has become [[BWV&nbsp;4.2]].<ref>{{BDh|4|0000|2019-03-11|Work|Christ lag in Todes Banden (Leipzig version) BWV 4.2; BWV 4}}</ref>\n\n===NBA===\n[[File:CU3title.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe|NBA]] illustrates its score editions with facsimiles from manuscripts or contemporary editions: for instance NBA Series IV Volume 4 (''[[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]]'') contains a facsimile of the title page of the 1739 first edition of that collection.]]\nIn the meantime, the [[New Bach Edition]] (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, abbreviated as NBA) was being published,<ref>[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nba/ Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750): New Edition of the Complete Works] at the [[B\u00e4renreiter]] website.</ref><ref name=\"NBAIMSLP\" /> offering a new system to refer to Bach's works, e.g. {{nobreak|NBA IV/4: 2, 105}}, which is Series&nbsp;IV, Volume&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;2 (Prelude) and p.&nbsp;105 (Fugue), for BWV&nbsp;552.\n\n====NBArev====\n{{see also|New Bach Edition#Revision}}\nSome years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher [[B\u00e4renreiter]] joined with the [[Bach Archive]] again to publish revised editions of some of Bach's scores.

In 1950 the piece was assigned the number 1076 in [[Wolfgang Schmieder|Schmieder]]'s catalogue of Bach's works (BWV). The 1998 edition of that catalogue (BWV<sup>2a</sup>) mentions Haussmann's paintings as original sources for the work (p. 438), and likewise the Bach digital website gives a description of both paintings as sources for the piece (linked from Bach digital Work page {{BDW|1262}}).]]\n{{Lists of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach}}\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed [[Bach cantata|cantatas]], [[List of motets by Johann Sebastian Bach|motets]], [[Bach's church music in Latin|masses, Magnificats]], [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], [[List of oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach|oratorios]], [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|four-part chorales]], [[List of songs and arias by Johann Sebastian Bach|songs and arias]].

Nearly all of them are listed in the ''{{lang|de|[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]]}}'' (BWV), which is the best known and most widely used catalogue of Bach's compositions.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Listing Bach's compositions==\nSome of the early [[biographies of Johann Sebastian Bach]] contain lists of his compositions. For instance, [[Bach's Nekrolog|his obituary]] contains a list of the instrumental [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime|compositions printed during the composer's lifetime]], followed by an approximate list of his unpublished work.{{sfn|Bach|Agricola|1754|pp=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_lfQ4AAAAIAAJ/page/n1045/mode/2up 167]\u2013[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_lfQ4AAAAIAAJ/page/n1047/mode/2up 169]}} The [[Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work|first separately published biography of the composer]], by [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]], follows the same approach: its ninth chapter first lists printed works (adding [[18th-century prints of Bach's four-part chorales|four-part chorales which had been published in the second half of the 18th century]]), followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones.{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/details/johannsebastian01terrgoog/page/n161/mode/2up \"Chapter IX: Bach's Compositions\" pp.&nbsp;114\u2013142]}} In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies (Schauer and Hilgenfeldt in 1850) had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the [[Prelude and Fugue in E flat major, BWV 552|Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major]] can be indicated as \"[[C. F. Peters]] Vol. III No. 1\", or any of the variants (\"[[Friedrich Konrad Griepenkerl|Griepenkerl]] and Roitzsch Vol. 3 p. 2\", \"Peters Book 242 p. 2\", \"P. S.

G., III., p. 173\" for the above-mentioned Prelude in E-flat major), and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkel's biography.{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up \"Appendix III\" pp.&nbsp;225\u2013286]}}\n\nBut there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bach's works according to [[Novello & Co|Novello]]'s editions, or [[Augener & Co.|Augener]]'s, or [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]]'s,... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bach's compositions (e.g. [https://archive.org/stream/organworksofbach00grac#page/305/mode/1up Harvey Grace's in a 1922 book on Bach's organ compositions]).\n\n====NBG====\nIn 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bach's known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] (NBG), with a new set of goals (Bach yearbook, Bach festivals, and a Bach museum). Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of ''[[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht]]'' was published in NBG XVII<sup>1</sup> in 1916 (the 1730s version of the same piece, with a different orchestration, had been published in BG 24, pp.&nbsp;185\u2013192).{{sfn|Forkel|Terry|1920|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastian01terrgoog#page/n274/mode/1up \"Appendix III\" pp.&nbsp;225\u2013286]}}\n\n===BWV===\n{{see also|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis}}\nIn 1950 the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach. [[Wolfgang Schmieder]], the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):{{sfn|Schmieder|1950}}\n[[File:Loure bach.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The BWV is a [[thematic catalogue]], thus it identifies every movement of every composition by its first measures, like the opening of [[Partita for Violin No. 3 (Bach)|BWV 1006]], movement 2 (Loure) above.]]\n# [[#BWV Chapter 1|Kantaten (Cantatas)]], BWV 1\u2013224\n# [[#BWV Chapter 2|Motetten (Motets)]], BWV 225\u2013231\n# [[#BWV Chapter 3|Messen, Messens\u00e4tze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat)]], BWV 232\u2013243\n# [[#BWV Chapter 4|Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios)]], BWV 244\u2013249\n# [[#BWV Chapter 5|Vierstimmige Chor\u00e4le (Four-part chorales)]], BWV 250\u2013438\n# [[#BWV Chapter 6|Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet)]], BWV 439\u2013524\n# [[#BWV Chapter 7|Werke f\u00fcr Orgel (Works for organ)]], BWV 525\u2013771\n# [[#BWV Chapter 8|Werke f\u00fcr Klavier (Keyboard compositions)]], BWV 772\u2013994\n# [[#BWV Chapter 9|Werke f\u00fcr Laute (Lute compositions)]], BWV 995\u20131000\n# [[#BWV Chapter 10|Kammermusik (Chamber music)]], BWV 1001\u20131040\n# [[#BWV Chapter 11|Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra)]], BWV 1041\u20131071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041\u20131065) and Overtures (BWV 1066\u20131071)\n# [[#BWV Chapter 12|Kanons (Canons)]], BWV 1072\u20131078\n# [[#BWV Chapter 13|Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue)]], BWV 1079\u20131080\n\nFor instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became [[BWV 552]], situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] for [[Mozart]]'s compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance [[BWV 992]] is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S.&nbsp;225 = [[BWV&nbsp;225]]).<ref>{{OCLC|18856743}}</ref>\n\nAnother consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance [[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]] was partly in the organ compositions range (BWV 552 and 669\u2013689), with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions (BWV 802\u2013805).\n\n====BWV Anh.====\nThe Anhang (Anh.), i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\n* [[#BWV Anhang|I \u2013 lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived]] (Anh. 1\u201323)\n* [[#BWV Anhang II|II \u2013 works of dubious authenticity]] (Anh. 24\u2013155)\n* [[#BWV Anhang III|III \u2013 works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him]] (Anh. 156\u2013189)\nWithin each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.\n\n====BWV<sup>2a</sup>====\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Video Camera Icon.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Minuet-G-Major-BWV-Anh-114.ogv\n| alt         = Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114\n| title       = Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114\n| description = [[Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114]]\n| filename2    = Minuet-G-minor-BWV-Anh-115.ogg\n| title2       = Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115\n| alt2         = Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115\n| description2 = [[Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114|Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115]]<br>Both Minuets were moved from '''[[#BWV Anhang II|Anh.&nbsp;II]]''' (doubtful works) to '''[[#BWV Anhang III|Anh.&nbsp;III]]''' (spurious works) in BWV<sup>2a</sup>, after they were attributed to [[Christian Petzold (composer)|Christian Petzold]].\n}}\nSchmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example, [[BWV 11]], formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted: \"{{nobreak|BWV 11/249b\u2192}}\" meaning \"BWV&nbsp;11, inserted after BWV&nbsp;249b\" (4th chapter). Similarly, {{nobreak|BWV 1083/243a\u2192}} meant [[BWV&nbsp;1083]], inserted after BWV&nbsp;243a (3rd chapter). Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g. \"{{nobreak|BWV Anh. II 114}}\" became \"{{nobreak|Anh. II 114/Anh. III 183\u2192}} indicating it was now considered a spurious work.{{sfn|Schmieder|1990}}\n\nIn 1998 [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]] and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV<sup>2a</sup>, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998}}\n\nNew additions (Nachtr\u00e4ge) to BWV<sup>2</sup>/BWV<sup>2a</sup> included:\n* [[#Additions to the main catalogue (BWV 1081\u20131126)|BWV 1081\u20131126]]\n* [[#Additions to the Anhang (BWV Anh. 190\u2013213)|BWV Anh. 190\u2013213]]\n\nA few exceptions to the principle that compositions weren't renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bach's, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;205 (BWV<sup>2</sup>) \u2192 BWV&nbsp;1121 (BWV<sup>2a</sup>, where it is in section 7 as a work for organ).<ref>{{BDh|1516|0|2019-05-14|Work|Fantasia, c BWV 1121 &#91;BWV 1998&#93;; BWV Anh. 205 / Anh. II 45&rarr;}}</ref>\n\nOther renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:\n* [[BWV 243a]]: 1723 E{{flat}} major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major [[BWV 243]]\n* [[BWV 1071]] renumbered to [[BWV 1046a]] (early version of the [[BWV 1046|first ''Brandenburg Concerto'']])\n* [[BWV Anh. 198]] renumbered to [[BWV 149/1a]] (earlier abandoned version of the opening movement of Cantata [[BWV&nbsp;149]])\n\nSome versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g. [[BWV 655b]] and [[BWV 655c|c]]\n\nSlashes indicate movements: e.g. [[BWV&nbsp;149]]/1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV&nbsp;149. Another example: the [[Mass in B minor structure#Agnus Dei|Agnus Dei]] of the [[Mass in B minor]] can be indicated as BWV&nbsp;232/22 (22nd movement of the composition), or alternatively as BWV&nbsp;232<sup>IV</sup>/4 (BWV 232, fourth movement of Part IV).\n\n====21st-century additions====\n[[#21st century (BWV 1127 and higher)|Numbers above BWV 1126]] were added in the 21st century.\n\n====Reconstructed versions====\nAn upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a [[#Reconstructions|reconstructed version]], that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 (Supplement) p.&nbsp;75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as [[BWV 1060R]].\n\n====BWV<sup>3</sup>====\nAs of mid-2018 the [[#BD|Bach digital]] website started to implement the new numbers of the 3rd edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, which has been announced for publication in 2020.{{sfn|Blanken|2019}} For example, the Leipzig version of the [[BWV 4|''Christ lag in Todes Banden'' cantata]] used to be BWV&nbsp;4 in previous versions of the catalogue, and, in BWV<sup>3</sup>, has become [[BWV&nbsp;4.2]].<ref>{{BDh|4|0000|2019-03-11|Work|Christ lag in Todes Banden (Leipzig version) BWV 4.2; BWV 4}}</ref>\n\n===NBA===\n[[File:CU3title.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe|NBA]] illustrates its score editions with facsimiles from manuscripts or contemporary editions: for instance NBA Series IV Volume 4 (''[[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]]'') contains a facsimile of the title page of the 1739 first edition of that collection.]]\nIn the meantime, the [[New Bach Edition]] (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, abbreviated as NBA) was being published,<ref>[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nba/ Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750): New Edition of the Complete Works] at the [[B\u00e4renreiter]] website.</ref><ref name=\"NBAIMSLP\" /> offering a new system to refer to Bach's works, e.g. {{nobreak|NBA IV/4: 2, 105}}, which is Series&nbsp;IV, Volume&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;2 (Prelude) and p.&nbsp;105 (Fugue), for BWV&nbsp;552.\n\n====NBArev====\n{{see also|New Bach Edition#Revision}}\nSome years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher [[B\u00e4renreiter]] joined with the [[Bach Archive]] again to publish revised editions of some of Bach's scores.

Where the original NBA editions were exclusively in German, the volumes of the Revised series have their introductions both in German and English. Its first volume, NBArev 1, was a new edition of the [[Mass in B minor]], appearing in 2010.<ref>[https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/catalogue/complete-editions/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works \u2013 Revised Edition] at the [[B\u00e4renreiter]] website.</ref>\n\n===BC===\nThe Bach Compendium (BC), a catalogue covering Bach's vocal works, was published in 1985.<ref>[[Hans-Joachim Schulze]] and [[Christoph Wolff]].

Lists following publication chronologies are for example implied in the first list in Bach's obituary, and BG numbers (within the BGA sequence of publication) \u2013 overall lists covering all of Bach's compositions in order of first publication are however not a way Bach's compositions are usually presented.\n\nListing Bach's works according to their time of composition can't be done comprehensively: for many works the period in which they were composed is a very wide range. For Bach's larger vocal works (cantatas, Passions,...) research has led to some more or less generally accepted chronologies, covering most of these works: a catalogue in this sense is Philippe (and G\u00e9rard) Zwang's list giving a chronological number to the cantatas BWV 1\u2013215 and 248\u2013249.<ref>[http://www.musiqueorguequebec.ca/catal/bacjs/corrbwvz.html Johann Sebastian Bach: Correspondance Catalogues Zwang \u2014 Schmeider] at {{url|www.musiqueorguequebec.ca}}</ref> This list was published in 1982 as ''Guide pratique des cantates de Bach'' in Paris, {{ISBN|2-221-00749-2}}.
