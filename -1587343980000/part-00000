Original from the University of California Digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref> Much of the local economy is based on the [[hospitality industry]] serving [[tourism]]. As of 2011, the city had a population of 36,501.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main article|History of Kodaikanal#Etymology}}\nIt is not known who first used this name or what they intended it to mean.\n\nThe word ''Kodaikanal'' is an amalgamation of two words: ''kodai'' and ''kanal''. The [[Tamil language]] has at least four possible interpretations of the name Kodaikanal. By pronouncing the first syllable of Kodaikanal with a long Tamil 'O', as in ''k''oe''-dei'', it means \"summer\", whilst the final two syllables ''kanal''  can mean \"to see\", rendering ''Kodaikanal'' as a \"place to see in summer\". Kodaikanal is a summer forest, and it is a place that the first missionaries used as a refuge to escape the overbearing and mosquito-ridden heat of the plains \u2014 a place that they would have counted on seeing in the summer!\n\n[[File:Boating in Kodaikanal with Mist falling in lake.jpg|thumb|Boating in Kodaikanal]]\n''Kanal'', in Tamil, can mean dense or closed forest. In this case, ''Kodai'' can have at least four meanings. By pronouncing ''Kodai'' with the long Tamil 'o' and short 'e', Ko-dai means \"the end\". Kodaikanal could mean \"the end of the forest\" which makes poetic and geographical sense \u2014 Kodaikanal is at the crown of the [[Palani Hills]] and is effectively surrounded and protected by thick forests.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nBy pronouncing Kodai with the short Tamil 'o' (as in Kodi), it means \"creepers\" or vines. Kodaikanal could mean \"forest of creepers\" or the forest of vines. \"The forest of creepers\" is thought to be the English language meaning given in 1885 during the early western habitation of the place<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediaofind02balfuoft/page/482 <!-- quote=point calimere. --> The Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia] by Edward Balfour, Published by B. Quaritch, 1885, Item notes: vol.2 H-NYSA, P583, Original from the University of Michigan, Digitized 29 Jan 2008</ref> and is still accepted.<ref>Mitchell Nora, ''Indian Hill Station: Kodaikanal'', University of Chicago, Dept. of Geography, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=jSjXSLfECIm6zAShg-XrDg&id=1yZjAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Mitchell%22+%22Indian+Hill+Station%22&q=+place+creepers+&pgis=1 place creepers, p. 98], 1972. Original from the University of California, digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref>\n\nBy pronouncing Kodai with a short Tamil 'o', and a long 'e', it might be interpreted to mean \"gift\", rendering \"Kodaikanal\" as \"gift of the forest\". Keeping the short Tamil 'o' but adding a long 'a', Kodai could be understood as the Tamil word for umbrella, where Kodaikanal is a forest fashioned like a protecting umbrella.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAnother Tamil word for creeper or vine is [[valli]], the honey collecting daughter of the chief of the Veddas mountain tribe. The chief and his wife prayed to the Mountain God for a girl and their prayers were answered when the chief found a newborn girl child during a hunting expedition. As she was found among creeper plants, they named her Valli and she grew up as princess of the tribe in [[Sangam landscape#Kurinji .E2.80.93 Mountainous Region|Kurinji]] and became the consort of lord [[Murugan]].<ref>[[Sangam landscape#Kurinji .E2.80.93 Mountainous Region]]</ref> The romantic traditions of Murugan in [[Murugan#Sangam literature|Sangam literature]] are thus associated with the name Kodaikanal.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Kodaikanal}}\nThe earliest residents of Kodaikanal were the [[Palaiyar]] tribal people. The earliest specific references to Kodaikanal and the Palani Hills are found in Tamil [[Sangam literature]] of the early Common era.<ref name=Mitchell>Mitchell Nora, ''Indian Hill Station: Kodaikanal'', University of Chicago, Dept. of Geography, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=jSjXSLfECIm6zAShg-XrDg&id=1yZjAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Mitchell%22+%22Indian+Hill+Station%22&q=+kodaikanal+sangam&pgis=1 Kodaikanal Sangam, p97], 1972 Original from the University of California Digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref>\nModern Kodaikanal was established by American [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|Christian missionaries]] and [[Company rule in India|British bureaucrats]] in 1845, as a refuge from the high temperatures and [[Tropical disease#Relation of climate to tropical diseases|tropical disease]]s of the [[Deccan plateau|plains]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> In the 20th century a few elite Indians came to realise the value of this enchanting hill station and started relocating here.<ref name=TDC>Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation and Department of Tourism,  [http://www.tamilnadutourism.org/places/citiestowns/Kodaikkanal.aspxCatId=C1&SubCat1Id=C1S1&SubCat2Id=C1S1S13 Kodaikanal Princess of Hill Stations]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTourism has been impacted by industrial pollution issues including the closure of a mercury factory owned by [[Unilever]]'s Indian [[subsidiary]] [[Hindustan Unilever]] after evidence of widespread [[mercury pollution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=260#env|publisher=[[Corporate Watch]]|title=Unilever Environmental Pollution|accessdate=2007-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213856/http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=260#env|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> To date no proper clean-up operation has been mounted.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:AMS-Kodaikanal.jpg|thumb|left|1955 topographic map of Kodaikanal]]\nThe town of Kodaikanal sits on a [[plateau]] above the southern [[escarpment]] of the upper [[Palani Hills]] at {{convert|2133|m}}, between the Parappar and Gundar Valleys. These hills form the eastward spur of the [[Western Ghats]] on the western side of [[South India]]. It has an irregular basin as its heartland, the centre of which is now [[Kodaikanal Lake]] a {{convert|5|km}} circumference manmade lake. A few kilometres away from Kodaikanal a small village named Vattakanal is located in the Dindigul District on the southern tip of the upper Palani hills in the state of Tamil Nadu, along the eastern coast of the Western Ghats. \n\nVattakanal is better known as 'Vatta', which means circle and by most or 'Little Israel' by the villagers that observe a large number of Israeli tourists who flock there from October onwards. \n\n[[Meadow]]s and [[grassland]]s cover the hillsides. Gigantic [[eucalyptus]] trees and [[shola]] forests flourish in the valleys. Mighty rocks and cascading streams lie above the valleys. There are many high waterfalls and ubiquitous gardens and flower beds in bloom.<ref name=\"TDC\"/>\n\n[[File:Pine Forest in Kodaikanal.jpg|thumb|left|Pine forest in Kodaikanal]]\n\nKodaikanal is known for its rich flora. Of the big trees, cypress, eucalyptus and acacia are the dominant varieties. Pear trees are numerous and the fruits are of high quality. Competing with the fruit trees are the flowering ones, mainly rhododendron and magnolia. Large dahlias of different hues are the main attraction of Bryant Park, situated close to the Kodai lake. Water lilies in the park's pond are another pleasing sight. The town abounds in beautiful yellow wild flowers.<ref>[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm The declining Kodai], Frontline Magazine pgs 74-81, 26 May-8 Jun 1989</ref>\n\nNorth of the town, high hills that slope down into the villages of Pallangi and [[Vilpatti]] stand guard. On the east the hill slopes less abruptly into the lower Palnis. A precipitous escarpment facing the [[Cumbum, Tamil Nadu|Cumbum Valley]] is on the south. On the west is a plateau leading to [[Manjampatti Valley]], [[Indira Gandhi National Park]], the [[Anamalai Hills]] and the main body of the [[Western Ghats]] of Kerala border.\n\n===Climate===\nKodaikanal has a monsoon-influenced [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with a ''Cwb'' tendency). The temperatures are cool throughout the year due to the high elevation of the city.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Kodaikanal (1981\u20132010, extremes 1901\u20132012)\n| metric first = Yes\n| single

Major roads are converted into one-way lanes to regulate the constant inflow of traffic and special police are brought in for the safety of the tourists and protection of local businesses. Hotels are often fully booked during the high season, and remain virtually empty during the off-season. Due to the rapid development of nearby cities such as [[Madurai]], [[Palani]] and [[Coimbatore]] the town is learning to deal with year-round tourism.\n\n[[File:Hillview of Kodaikanal from Coaker's Walk.jpg|thumb|Hill view of Kodaikanal from Coaker's Walk]]\nPlums, pears, chile peppers, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, garlic, and onions are cultivated by [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace farmers]] in surrounding villages.

These hospitals treat patients with common ailments and injuries and perform child delivery and care, but are not equipped with modern medical equipment for complicated diagnoses and surgery.\n\nKHMS hospital was formed in 2009 to provide quality health care to residents and visitors.\n\nIn April 1915, Dr. Van Allen raised funds to construct the first unit of the hospital at the entrance of Coaker's walk. It was named after him. Its facilities have been updated and now it has an X-ray machine, well equipped pathological lab, and operation theatre with blood transfusion facilities.\n\nThe Government Hospital is situated on the hillside near Rock Cottage on Lower Shola Road. It was a small municipal hospital until 1927. Now it has X-ray, dental, and maternity wards and other facilities.\n\n===Kodaikanal mercury poisoning===\nAir and water-borne [[Mercury (element)#Safety|mercury emissions]] have [[Kodaikanal Mercury Poisoning|contaminated large areas of Kodaikanal]] and the surrounding forests. A study conducted by the Department of Atomic Energy confirmed that Kodaikanal Lake has been contaminated by mercury emissions.\n\n[[Mercury poisoning#Organic mercury compounds|Mercury pollution]] was reported in Kodaikanal affecting lakes in the area. The causes, originating from a [[Hindustan Unilever]] thermometer factory nearby, were reported to be dispersal of elemental mercury into the atmosphere from improper storage and dispersal into the water from surface effluents from the factory. Apart from tests conducted on Kodaikanal lake, [[moss]] samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from the factory, were also tested. These showed mercury levels in the range of 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg, while in Kodaikanal lake the [[lichen]] and moss levels were 7.9&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg and 8.3&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg, respectively. Fish samples were taken from Kodaikanal lake also showed Hg levels in the range of 120 to 290&nbsp;mg/kg, confirming that pollution of the lake had taken place due to mercury emissions from the factory.\n\nThe Hindustan Unilever thermometer factory caused widespread mercury pollution through improper disposal of broken thermometer waste containing large quantities of mercury. The factory sold much of this waste to a junkyard in Kodaikanal and also dumped large quantities in the forest behind the factory. The factory was eventually closed in 2001 after 18 years of operation. Hindustan Lever have used considerable legal manoeuvering to avoid paying compensation to the workers and their families, many of whom died or became physically handicapped as a result of mercury poisoning.\n\nThe ex-workers joined to form the 559-strong Ex-Mercury Employees Welfare Association and in 2006 filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) suit in the [[Madras High Court]]. The association wants an economic rehabilitation scheme, healthcare treatment and a monitoring programme at the company's expense for everyone who ever worked in the factory. It also wants the company prosecuted. Hindustan Unilever denies that any of the health problems of the workers or their families were the result of mercury exposure in the factory. In 2010 the workers were still fighting for compensation.\n\nIn June 2007, the Madras High Court constituted a five-member expert committee to decide on the mercury workers' health claims. The last court hearing was in June 2008. The committee later failed to find sufficient evidence to link the current clinical condition of the factory workers to past mercury exposure in the factory.\n\nAdditional site remediation studies are being undertaken by national institutions, as desired by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the Court's Scientific Experts Committee (SEC) during the project review meeting in January 2010. [[IIT Delhi]] is revalidating the risk assessment study and site-specific clean-up standards; the [[National Botanical Research Institute]], Lucknow, is studying the impact on trees and preservation of trees; and the Centre for Soil and Water Conservation Research and Training Institute, Ooty, is studying the impact on soil and soil erosion. Based on the above study findings, results of remediation trials and recommendations of the SEC, the TNPCB will take a final decision on the clean-up standards. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. will commence soil remediation work at the factory site once a decision on clean-up standards is taken and consent is given by TNPCB.\n\n==Education==\nThere are many educational institutions in Kodaikanal. Kodaikanal comes under the Batlagundu educational district.

Amongst the most popular is Union Church with a large Tamil congregation, and Margaret Eddy Memorial Chapel at Kodai International School with lively services in a typically American style and distinctive stone architecture.\n\nThere are many [[Hindu temple#South Indian temples|Hindu temples]] in Kodaikanal including the [[Durga]]i Amman Kovil, Kurinji Andavar Kovil, [[Mariamman]] Kovil, Observatory [[Murugan]] Kovil and [[Vinayagar]] Kovil. The [[Tamil Muslim|Muslim]] [[mosque]]s are Ellis Villa, Munjikal, Naidupuram, Observatory,Perumal malai and Anna nagar. There is an active community of [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] refugees.\n\nThe [[Kuzhanthai Velappar temple]] (Kulandai Velayudha Swami Tirukkovil) has three thousand years of history and was consecrated by [[Bhogar]].

Original from the University of California Digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref> Much of the local economy is based on the [[hospitality industry]] serving [[tourism]]. As of 2011, the city had a population of 36,501.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main article|History of Kodaikanal#Etymology}}\nIt is not known who first used this name or what they intended it to mean.\n\nThe word ''Kodaikanal'' is an amalgamation of two words: ''kodai'' and ''kanal''. The [[Tamil language]] has at least four possible interpretations of the name Kodaikanal. By pronouncing the first syllable of Kodaikanal with a long Tamil 'O', as in ''k''oe''-dei'', it means \"summer\", whilst the final two syllables ''kanal''  can mean \"to see\", rendering ''Kodaikanal'' as a \"place to see in summer\". Kodaikanal is a summer forest, and it is a place that the first missionaries used as a refuge to escape the overbearing and mosquito-ridden heat of the plains \u2014 a place that they would have counted on seeing in the summer!\n\n[[File:Boating in Kodaikanal with Mist falling in lake.jpg|thumb|Boating in Kodaikanal]]\n''Kanal'', in Tamil, can mean dense or closed forest. In this case, ''Kodai'' can have at least four meanings. By pronouncing ''Kodai'' with the long Tamil 'o' and short 'e', Ko-dai means \"the end\". Kodaikanal could mean \"the end of the forest\" which makes poetic and geographical sense \u2014 Kodaikanal is at the crown of the [[Palani Hills]] and is effectively surrounded and protected by thick forests.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nBy pronouncing Kodai with the short Tamil 'o' (as in Kodi), it means \"creepers\" or vines. Kodaikanal could mean \"forest of creepers\" or the forest of vines. \"The forest of creepers\" is thought to be the English language meaning given in 1885 during the early western habitation of the place<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediaofind02balfuoft/page/482 <!-- quote=point calimere. --> The Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia] by Edward Balfour, Published by B. Quaritch, 1885, Item notes: vol.2 H-NYSA, P583, Original from the University of Michigan, Digitized 29 Jan 2008</ref> and is still accepted.<ref>Mitchell Nora, ''Indian Hill Station: Kodaikanal'', University of Chicago, Dept. of Geography, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=jSjXSLfECIm6zAShg-XrDg&id=1yZjAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Mitchell%22+%22Indian+Hill+Station%22&q=+place+creepers+&pgis=1 place creepers, p. 98], 1972. Original from the University of California, digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref>\n\nBy pronouncing Kodai with a short Tamil 'o', and a long 'e', it might be interpreted to mean \"gift\", rendering \"Kodaikanal\" as \"gift of the forest\". Keeping the short Tamil 'o' but adding a long 'a', Kodai could be understood as the Tamil word for umbrella, where Kodaikanal is a forest fashioned like a protecting umbrella.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAnother Tamil word for creeper or vine is [[valli]], the honey collecting daughter of the chief of the Veddas mountain tribe. The chief and his wife prayed to the Mountain God for a girl and their prayers were answered when the chief found a newborn girl child during a hunting expedition. As she was found among creeper plants, they named her Valli and she grew up as princess of the tribe in [[Sangam landscape#Kurinji .E2.80.93 Mountainous Region|Kurinji]] and became the consort of lord [[Murugan]].<ref>[[Sangam landscape#Kurinji .E2.80.93 Mountainous Region]]</ref> The romantic traditions of Murugan in [[Murugan#Sangam literature|Sangam literature]] are thus associated with the name Kodaikanal.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Kodaikanal}}\nThe earliest residents of Kodaikanal were the [[Palaiyar]] tribal people. The earliest specific references to Kodaikanal and the Palani Hills are found in Tamil [[Sangam literature]] of the early Common era.<ref name=Mitchell>Mitchell Nora, ''Indian Hill Station: Kodaikanal'', University of Chicago, Dept. of Geography, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=jSjXSLfECIm6zAShg-XrDg&id=1yZjAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Mitchell%22+%22Indian+Hill+Station%22&q=+kodaikanal+sangam&pgis=1 Kodaikanal Sangam, p97], 1972 Original from the University of California Digitized 28 Jan 2008</ref>\nModern Kodaikanal was established by American [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|Christian missionaries]] and [[Company rule in India|British bureaucrats]] in 1845, as a refuge from the high temperatures and [[Tropical disease#Relation of climate to tropical diseases|tropical disease]]s of the [[Deccan plateau|plains]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> In the 20th century a few elite Indians came to realise the value of this enchanting hill station and started relocating here.<ref name=TDC>Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation and Department of Tourism,  [http://www.tamilnadutourism.org/places/citiestowns/Kodaikkanal.aspxCatId=C1&SubCat1Id=C1S1&SubCat2Id=C1S1S13 Kodaikanal Princess of Hill Stations]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTourism has been impacted by industrial pollution issues including the closure of a mercury factory owned by [[Unilever]]'s Indian [[subsidiary]] [[Hindustan Unilever]] after evidence of widespread [[mercury pollution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=260#env|publisher=[[Corporate Watch]]|title=Unilever Environmental Pollution|accessdate=2007-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213856/http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/?lid=260#env|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> To date no proper clean-up operation has been mounted.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:AMS-Kodaikanal.jpg|thumb|left|1955 topographic map of Kodaikanal]]\nThe town of Kodaikanal sits on a [[plateau]] above the southern [[escarpment]] of the upper [[Palani Hills]] at {{convert|2133|m}}, between the Parappar and Gundar Valleys. These hills form the eastward spur of the [[Western Ghats]] on the western side of [[South India]]. It has an irregular basin as its heartland, the centre of which is now [[Kodaikanal Lake]] a {{convert|5|km}} circumference manmade lake. A few kilometres away from Kodaikanal a small village named Vattakanal is located in the Dindigul District on the southern tip of the upper Palani hills in the state of Tamil Nadu, along the eastern coast of the Western Ghats. \n\nVattakanal is better known as 'Vatta', which means circle and by most or 'Little Israel' by the villagers that observe a large number of Israeli tourists who flock there from October onwards. \n\n[[Meadow]]s and [[grassland]]s cover the hillsides. Gigantic [[eucalyptus]] trees and [[shola]] forests flourish in the valleys. Mighty rocks and cascading streams lie above the valleys. There are many high waterfalls and ubiquitous gardens and flower beds in bloom.<ref name=\"TDC\"/>\n\n[[File:Pine Forest in Kodaikanal.jpg|thumb|left|Pine forest in Kodaikanal]]\n\nKodaikanal is known for its rich flora. Of the big trees, cypress, eucalyptus and acacia are the dominant varieties. Pear trees are numerous and the fruits are of high quality. Competing with the fruit trees are the flowering ones, mainly rhododendron and magnolia. Large dahlias of different hues are the main attraction of Bryant Park, situated close to the Kodai lake. Water lilies in the park's pond are another pleasing sight. The town abounds in beautiful yellow wild flowers.<ref>[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm The declining Kodai], Frontline Magazine pgs 74-81, 26 May-8 Jun 1989</ref>\n\nNorth of the town, high hills that slope down into the villages of Pallangi and [[Vilpatti]] stand guard. On the east the hill slopes less abruptly into the lower Palnis. A precipitous escarpment facing the [[Cumbum, Tamil Nadu|Cumbum Valley]] is on the south. On the west is a plateau leading to [[Manjampatti Valley]], [[Indira Gandhi National Park]], the [[Anamalai Hills]] and the main body of the [[Western Ghats]] of Kerala border.\n\n===Climate===\nKodaikanal has a monsoon-influenced [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with a ''Cwb'' tendency). The temperatures are cool throughout the year due to the high elevation of the city.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Kodaikanal (1981\u20132010, extremes 1901\u20132012)\n| metric first = Yes\n| single

A study conducted by the Department of Atomic Energy confirmed that Kodaikanal Lake has been contaminated by mercury emissions.\n\n[[Mercury poisoning#Organic mercury compounds|Mercury pollution]] was reported in Kodaikanal affecting lakes in the area. The causes, originating from a [[Hindustan Unilever]] thermometer factory nearby, were reported to be dispersal of elemental mercury into the atmosphere from improper storage and dispersal into the water from surface effluents from the factory. Apart from tests conducted on Kodaikanal lake, [[moss]] samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from the factory, were also tested. These showed mercury levels in the range of 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg, while in Kodaikanal lake the [[lichen]] and moss levels were 7.9&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg and 8.3&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg, respectively. Fish samples were taken from Kodaikanal lake also showed Hg levels in the range of 120 to 290&nbsp;mg/kg, confirming that pollution of the lake had taken place due to mercury emissions from the factory.\n\nThe Hindustan Unilever thermometer factory caused widespread mercury pollution through improper disposal of broken thermometer waste containing large quantities of mercury. The factory sold much of this waste to a junkyard in Kodaikanal and also dumped large quantities in the forest behind the factory. The factory was eventually closed in 2001 after 18 years of operation. Hindustan Lever have used considerable legal manoeuvering to avoid paying compensation to the workers and their families, many of whom died or became physically handicapped as a result of mercury poisoning.\n\nThe ex-workers joined to form the 559-strong Ex-Mercury Employees Welfare Association and in 2006 filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) suit in the [[Madras High Court]]. The association wants an economic rehabilitation scheme, healthcare treatment and a monitoring programme at the company's expense for everyone who ever worked in the factory. It also wants the company prosecuted. Hindustan Unilever denies that any of the health problems of the workers or their families were the result of mercury exposure in the factory. In 2010 the workers were still fighting for compensation.\n\nIn June 2007, the Madras High Court constituted a five-member expert committee to decide on the mercury workers' health claims. The last court hearing was in June 2008. The committee later failed to find sufficient evidence to link the current clinical condition of the factory workers to past mercury exposure in the factory.\n\nAdditional site remediation studies are being undertaken by national institutions, as desired by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the Court's Scientific Experts Committee (SEC) during the project review meeting in January 2010. [[IIT Delhi]] is revalidating the risk assessment study and site-specific clean-up standards; the [[National Botanical Research Institute]], Lucknow, is studying the impact on trees and preservation of trees; and the Centre for Soil and Water Conservation Research and Training Institute, Ooty, is studying the impact on soil and soil erosion. Based on the above study findings, results of remediation trials and recommendations of the SEC, the TNPCB will take a final decision on the clean-up standards. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. will commence soil remediation work at the factory site once a decision on clean-up standards is taken and consent is given by TNPCB.\n\n==Education==\nThere are many educational institutions in Kodaikanal.

Usually the trigger event is a system failure or detection of operating conditions considered dangerously out of the normal range. [[Cosmic ray]]s penetrating spacecraft electrical systems can create false signals or commands and thus cause a trigger event. The [[Cosmic ray#Effect on electronics|central processor electronics]] are especially prone to such events.<ref name=\"planning\"/>\nAnother trigger is the lack of a received command within a given time window. Lack of received commands can be caused by hardware failures or mis-programming of the spacecraft, as in the case of the [[Viking 1]] lander.\n\nThe process of entering safe mode, sometimes referred to as ''safing'',<ref name=\"cassini\" /> involves a number of immediate physical actions taken to prevent damage or complete loss. Power is removed from non-essential subsystems. Regaining attitude control, if lost, is the highest priority because it is necessary to maintain thermal balance and proper illumination of the solar panels.<ref name=primary /> A tumbling or cartwheeling spacecraft can quickly roast, freeze or exhaust its battery power and be lost forever.<ref name=SOHO />\n\n==In safe mode==\nWhile in safe mode the preservation of the spacecraft is the highest priority. Typically all non-essential systems, such as science instruments, are shut down. The spacecraft attempts to maintain orientation with respect to the [[Sun]] for illumination of [[solar panels]] and for thermal management.

Usually the trigger event is a system failure or detection of operating conditions considered dangerously out of the normal range. [[Cosmic ray]]s penetrating spacecraft electrical systems can create false signals or commands and thus cause a trigger event. The [[Cosmic_ray#Effect_on_electronics|central processor electronics]] are especially prone to such events.<ref name=\"planning\"/>\nAnother trigger is the lack of a received command within a given time window. Lack of received commands can be caused by hardware failures or mis-programming of the spacecraft, as in the case of the [[Viking 1]] lander.\n\nThe process of entering safe mode, sometimes referred to as ''safing'',<ref name=\"cassini\" /> involves a number of immediate physical actions taken to prevent damage or complete loss. Power is removed from non-essential subsystems. Regaining attitude control, if lost, is the highest priority because it is necessary to maintain thermal balance and proper illumination of the solar panels.<ref name=primary /> A tumbling or cartwheeling spacecraft can quickly roast, freeze or exhaust its battery power and be lost forever.<ref name=SOHO />\n\n==In safe mode==\nWhile in safe mode the preservation of the spacecraft is the highest priority. Typically all non-essential systems, such as science instruments, are shut down. The spacecraft attempts to maintain orientation with respect to the [[Sun]] for illumination of [[solar panels]] and for thermal management.

In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is invited by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) to speak to his [[business school]] class. When many of the students question the usefulness of paper in a computerized world, Michael attempts to inform the class of how essential paper is. Meanwhile, a [[bat]] becomes trapped in the office, leading [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) on a mission to catch a bat. \n\nThe episode aired on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on February 15, 2007, and was seen by an estimated 8.84 million viewers according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. It was positively received by television critics, with several writing positively of Joss Whedon's involvement. Carell's performance was also positively received, and several critics applauded the scene in which Michael says positive things about Pam's art.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) invites [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) to speak at his business-school class. Michael is excited, but Ryan admits in a talking head interview that he has only invited Michael because his professor promised to bump up the grade of any student who brings his boss into class. During his introduction of Michael, Ryan predicts that [[Dunder Mifflin]] will become obsolete within five to ten years. However, Michael could not hear him and proceeds to ruin the event with his antics (including tearing pages out of a student's textbook to prove you \"can't learn from textbooks\"). One of Ryan's classmates asks for Michael's opinion of Ryan's prediction. Infuriated and hurt, Michael punishes Ryan by relocating his desk to the \"annex,\" where [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) works. Kelly babbles uncontrollably in excitement at the news. \n\nMeanwhile, [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies through the office, sending the employees scurrying for cover. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and is turning into a [[vampire]]. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5 p.m. passes and the other employees go home, save [[Meredith Palmer|Meredith]] ([[Kate Flannery]]), who continues to hide in the breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.\n\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), in the meantime, invites her co-workers to her art show after work. At the show, [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and his partner Gil ([[Tom Chick]]) critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as \"motel art,\" not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a \"boyfriend's gesture\" with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip back to the office to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building, saying that he is very proud of her. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the wall next to his office.\n\n== Production ==\n[[Image:Joss_Whedon_by_Gage_Skidmore_7.jpg|right|thumb|150px|\"Business School\" was directed by [[Joss Whedon]].]]\n\"Business School\" was the second ''Office'' episode written by Brent Forrester. Forrester had previously written \"[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]].\" The episode was the first to be directed by [[Joss Whedon]]. Whedon, who is a friend of both producer [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Jenna Fischer]], and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode \"because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show.\"<ref name=\"whedon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/joss_whedon/3|title=Interview with Joss Whedon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140313/http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/joss_whedon/3|archivedate=October 11, 2007|date=August 8, 2007|work=[[The A.V.

But that's how that happened. God, it was fun.\"<ref name=\"whedon\"/> Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. \"I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it\u2026 But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated.\"<ref name=\"whedon\"/> At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted did not suit Whedon; he explained, \"I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"whedon\"/> Whedon said that he held up filming for more than an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.<ref name=\"whedon\"/>\n\nFor the scenes which involved filming with a bat, the production team used an actual bat, an animated bat, and a mechanical bat. When around the actual bat, Kate Flannery, who portrays Meredith Palmer, stated that \"we had to be extremely quiet around [it], basically pretending to scream.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officetally.com/more-on-kate-and-the-bat|title=More on Kate and the bat|work=OfficeTally|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=February 22, 2007|author=Flannery, Kate}}</ref> [[California State University, Northridge]] served as the backdrop for Ryan's business school and the art show; the scenes at the institution were shot in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/licensing/filming.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113054034/http://www.csun.edu/licensing/filming.php|archivedate=January 13, 2008|date=2007|title=Filming at Cal State, Northridge|publisher=[[California State University Northridge]]|access-date=October 8, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Business School\" first aired on February 15, 2007 in the United States on NBC.

In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is invited by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) to speak to his [[business school]] class. When many of the students question the usefulness of paper in a computerized world, Michael attempts to inform the class of how essential paper is. Meanwhile, a [[bat]] becomes trapped in the office, leading [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) on a mission to protect the employees.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Brent Forrester]], and directed by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' creator [[Joss Whedon]]. Whedon became involved with the show due to being a friend of series creator [[Greg Daniels]] as well as series co-star [[Jenna Fischer]]. Despite Whedon's experience with ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', the subplot about Dwight coming to believe that [[Jim Halpert]] is a vampire was entirely coincidental.\n\nThe episode aired on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on February 15, 2007, and was seen by an estimated 8.84 million viewers according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. It was positively received by television critics, with several writing positively of Joss Whedon's involvement. Carell's performance was also positively received, and several critics applauded the scene in which Michael says positive things about Pam's art.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) invites [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) to speak at his business-school class. Michael is excited, but Ryan admits in a talking head interview that he has only invited Michael because his professor promised to bump up the grade of any student who brings his boss into class. During his introduction of Michael, Ryan predicts that [[Dunder Mifflin]] will become obsolete within five to ten years. However, Michael could not hear him and proceeds to ruin the event with his antics (including tearing pages out of a student's textbook to prove you \"can't learn from textbooks\"). One of Ryan's classmates asks for Michael's opinion of Ryan's prediction. Infuriated and hurt, Michael punishes Ryan by relocating his desk to the \"annex,\" where [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) works. Kelly babbles uncontrollably in excitement at the news. \n\nMeanwhile, [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies through the office, sending the employees scurrying for cover. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and is turning into a [[vampire]]. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5 p.m. passes and the other employees go home, save [[Meredith Palmer|Meredith]] ([[Kate Flannery]]), who continues to hide in the breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.\n\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), in the meantime, invites her co-workers to her art show after work. At the show, [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and his partner Gil ([[Tom Chick]]) critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as \"motel art,\" not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a \"boyfriend's gesture\" with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip back to the office to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building, saying that he is very proud of her. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the wall next to his office.\n\n== Production ==\n[[Image:Joss_Whedon_by_Gage_Skidmore_7.jpg|right|thumb|150px|\"Business School\" was directed by [[Joss Whedon]].]]\n\"Business School\" was the second ''Office'' episode written by Brent Forrester. Forrester had previously written \"[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]].\" The episode was the first to be directed by [[Joss Whedon]]. Whedon, who is a friend of both producer [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Jenna Fischer]], and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode \"because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show.\"<ref name=\"whedon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/joss_whedon/3|title=Interview with Joss Whedon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140313/http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/joss_whedon/3|archivedate=October 11, 2007|date=August 8, 2007|work=[[The A.V.

Especially when people died. And a lot of people do die in ['Business School'].\"<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Joss Whedon|Whedon, Joss]] |date=2007 |title=Audio commentary for \"Business School\" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Three'' Disc 3 }}</ref> But upon completing the episode, Whedon said, \"That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun.\"<ref name=\"whedon\"/> Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. \"I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it\u2026 But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated.\"<ref name=\"whedon\"/> At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted did not suit Whedon; he explained, \"I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"whedon\"/> Whedon said that he held up filming for more than an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.<ref name=\"whedon\"/>\n\nFor the scenes which involved filming with a bat, the production team used an actual bat, an animated bat, and a mechanical bat. When around the actual bat, Kate Flannery, who portrays Meredith Palmer, stated that \"we had to be extremely quiet around [it], basically pretending to scream.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officetally.com/more-on-kate-and-the-bat|title=More on Kate and the bat|work=OfficeTally|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=February 22, 2007|author=Flannery, Kate}}</ref> [[California State University, Northridge]] served as the backdrop for Ryan's business school and the art show; the scenes at the institution were shot in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/licensing/filming.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113054034/http://www.csun.edu/licensing/filming.php|archivedate=January 13, 2008|date=2007|title=Filming at Cal State, Northridge|publisher=[[California State University Northridge]]|access-date=October 8, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Business School\" first aired on February 15, 2007 in the United States on NBC.

I-75 enters the [[East Tennessee]] region following the [[Tennessee Valley]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all the way through [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to near [[Rocky Top, Tennessee|Rocky Top]], then climbs into the [[Cumberland Mountains]] before crossing over into [[Kentucky]] at Jellico.\n\nOf the six states that I-75 traverses, the segment in Tennessee is the shortest, at {{convert|161.86|mi|km}}. Between Chattanooga and Knoxville, I-75 follows the route of [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 11]] (US 11), and from Knoxville into Kentucky it follows the route of [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]]. Beginning in Chattanooga, I-75 follows the route of [[U.S. Route 41|US 41]] for the rest of the length to its southern terminus in [[Miami]].\n\n==Route description==\n===Chattanooga===\n[[File:Cleveland, TN Scenic View.jpg|thumb|Scenic view along Interstate 75 southbound crossing [[White Oak Mountain]]]]\nInterstate 75 enters Tennessee on the eastern side of [[East Ridge, Tennessee|East Ridge]], a southern suburb of [[Chattanooga]]. Less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} mile into Tennessee is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 41]] (US 41/Unsigned [[U.S. Route 76|US 76]]). About a mile later, at exit 2, is a three way interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 24]], which runs west into [[Downtown Chattanooga]] and to [[Nashville]]. At this interchange, I-75 turns northeast, running along the eastern boundary of Chattanooga. Almost two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 320|State Route 320]] (SR 320), which connects to [[East Brainerd, Tennessee|East Brainerd]], and about a half mile later is a three way interchange with the southern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 153|SR 153]], a [[controlled access highway]] that runs northwest to the [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]] and crosses the [[Tennessee River]] on the [[Chickamauga Dam]]. Accessible from the northbound lanes at this interchange is Hamilton Place Boulevard, a connector to [[Hamilton Place (shopping mall)|Hamilton Place Mall]]. The southbound lanes of I-75 are also accessible from an entrance ramp from this road. At this point, I-75 enters a large commercial area dominated by Hamilton Place, and has an interchange with Shallowford Road about a mile later. A few miles later, at exit 7, I-75 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]] southbound, [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US 64]] westbound and [[Tennessee State Route 317|SR 317]] westbound, and begins a concurrency with these respective routes. Turning slightly northeast, the interstate crosses a [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and at exit 9, SR 317 splits off to the east. I-75 then crosses a steep ridge, passing between the [[Enterprise South Industrial Park]] to the west and [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] to the east. A few miles later, in [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]], US 11/64 split off at exit 11, where the route narrows to six lanes. I-75 then turns northwest, and narrows to four lanes.\n\n===Bradley to Loudon counties===\n[[File:TN I75 North-Exit 49.jpg|thumb|left|I-75 northbound in [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]].]]\nA few miles later, I-75 begins a steep ascent up the western slope of [[White Oak Mountain]], where the northbound lanes receive a [[truck climbing lane]]. At this point, the interstate turns northeast, and for the next three miles traverses east northeast over the top of White Oak Mountain, where it crosses into [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley County]]. I-75 then runs for the next several miles through a predominantly wooded and agricultural area and crossing a few ridges before reaching [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]] at an interchange with [[APD-40]] eastbound (US 64 Bypass), a bypass and connector to US 64. Running along the western edge of Cleveland, I-75 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 60|SR 60]] about 4.5 miles later, also crossing [[Candies Creek Ridge]] at this location, and less than 2 miles later, an interchange with [[Paul Huff Parkway]], a major thoroughfare along the northern part of Cleveland. The interstate then leaves Cleveland, and enters rural northern Bradley County, running northeast. Beginning at this point and continuing for nearly 60 miles, I-75 is very straight and flat, with few curves. Nearly the entirety of this section also contains an extremely wide [[median (highway)|median]], mostly separated by trees. In some locations, the north and southbound lanes are as much as a half mile apart.\n\nAbout twelve miles north of the central business district of Cleveland, I-75 curves to the northeast, and crosses the [[Hiwassee River]] into [[McMinn County, Tennessee|McMinn County]], and then curves back to the northwest. This area is extremely susceptible to [[fog]] hazards, which obscures the visibility of drivers, and several bad accidents have occurred on this section as a result. Running through mostly wooded and agricultural areas, I-75 reaches [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]] about 15 miles later, and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 30|SR 30]], a major east-west corridor in East Tennessee. Running through northern McMinn County, the interstate passes near several unincorporated communities, and has interchanges with several secondary state highways. Around mile marker 58, I-75 enters [[Monroe County, Tennessee|Monroe County]], and a few miles later passes near the town of [[Sweetwater, Tennessee|Sweetwater]], containing an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 68|SR 68]], another major primary state highway. A few miles later, I-75 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]]. At exit 72 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 72|SR 72]], which connects to [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], and a few miles later, the highway crosses the [[Tennessee River]] on the [[Mitchell W. Stout]] Memorial Bridges. I-75 then enters a predominantly commercial and residential area, and has an interchange with US 321 and SR 95 in [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]]. These routes also connect to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]]. Curving slightly to the west and then again to the east, I-75 reaches an interchange with I-40 westbound about three miles later, where it begins a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with I-40. About 20 miles west southwest of [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], the concurrent routes widen to six lanes and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] less than a mile later.\n\n===Knoxville===\n{{see also|Interstate 40 in Tennessee#East Tennessee}}\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|right|I-75 north, along its [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|I-40]] east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\nRunning approximately east northeast the two interstates pass through the western suburbs of Knoxville including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]] and [[West Knoxville]]. Along this concurrency exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. At exit 374 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]] (Lovell Road), where the highway widens to eight lanes, and less than two miles later is a four way interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge to the west and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]] to the east. At exit 380 is an interchange with US 11/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|70]] ([[Kingston Pike]]), which connects to the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood and [[West Town Mall]]. About 5 miles later, at an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], the northern bypass around downtown Knoxville, I-75 splits north off of I-40 and onto a concurrency with I-640. Along this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-640 mileage. Heading north, the interstates come to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]] (Western Avenue) about a mile later. About 1.5 miles later is a complicated interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]] southbound, the former route of I-75, and [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], where I-75 splits off.\n\n===Clinch River Valley and Cumberland Mountains===\nLeaving Knoxville, I-75 turns north, crossing several paralleling ridges of the [[Ridge and Valley Appalachians]]. The terrain for the next {{convert|20|mi|km}} of I-75 north of Knoxville are mostly flat. At exit 112 in [[Powell, Tennessee|Powell]], I-75 once again has an interchange with SR 131, and the Interstate narrows from six to four lanes. Entering a rural area, I-75 runs along a creek valley for the next several miles that bisects several ridges in a crooked and hazardous segment marked by several S-curves. Maintaining its north-northwesterly direction, I-75 crosses into [[Anderson County, Tennessee|Anderson County]]. Beyond this section, the [[Cumberland Mountains]] become visible in the distance. At exit 122 the Interstate has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route|SR 61]] near [[Clinton, Tennessee|Clinton]]. I-75 then descends sharply into a valley, crossing the Clinch River a few miles later. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, near the community of [[Rocky Top, Tennessee|Rocky Top]], I-75 has interchanges with US 441, and US 25W, running concurrently with the latter. The Interstate then crosses into [[Campbell County, Tennessee|Campbell County]].\n\n[[File:I 75 Jellico Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|View from I-75 on top of Jellico Mountain near the Kentucky border.]]\nFor approximately the last {{convert|30|mi|km}} in Tennessee, I-75 traverses the Cumberland Mountains. This entire section is considered very scenic and is prone to rockslides in many locations. Around milepost 130, I-75 begins its first major ascent for a few miles before leveling out on one of the plateaus of Cumberland Mountains, and at exit 134, near the community of [[Caryville, Tennessee|Caryville]], US 25W splits off and I-75 begins a concurrency with [[Tennessee State Route 63|SR 63]]. The Interstate then begins another ascent, adding a truck climbing lane going northbound. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway levels out on another one of the plateaus and the truck lane terminates. Less than a mile later, SR 63 splits off near the unincorporated community of [[Pioneer, Tennessee|Pioneer]]. Traveling through a further sparsely populated rural area marked by dense woodlands, I-75 remains relatively flat for the next few miles before beginning another ascent up the Cumberland Mountains, once again adding a truck climbing lane. [[Jellico Mountain]] is a sub-mountain range of the Cumberland Mountains that the interstate traverses near Jellico. I-75 curves sharply to the northeast and about a mile later, it reaches the crests of Jellico Mountain where the truck lane ends. The interstate then climbs the crests of Jellico Mountain for about another {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} before levelling out on top of Jellico Mountain at an elevation of about {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} and has an interchange with US 25W in the city of [[Jellico, Tennessee|Jellico]]. Less than a mile later, I-75 enters the hilly terrains of eastern Kentucky.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nConstruction of I-75 in Tennessee began in 1958 with short segments in Chattanooga and Knoxville. The route was completed through Chattanooga on July 17, 1963, with the completion of the {{convert|6.6|mi|km}} segment between the split with I-24 and US 11/64 (Bonny Oaks Drive).<ref>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = Freeway Use 'Multiplies' |url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/604329490/ |work = [[Chattanooga Daily Times]] |date = July 17, 1963 |access-date = December 8, 2019 |via = Newspapers.com }}</ref> I-75 was completed through Knoxville in late 1965.<ref name=Tennessean>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = Interstate System near Halfway Mark |url = https://tennessean.newspapers.com/image/113227818/ |work = [[The Tennessean]] |location = Nashville |date = October 27, 1966 |page = 22 |access-date = November 28, 2017 }}</ref> The section between Ooltewah and SR 60 in Cleveland opened on October 18, 1966.<ref>{{cite news |title = Ribbon Cutting Ceremony Opens I-75 in Cleveland |date = October 19, 1966 |work = [[Cleveland Daily Banner]] |page = 1 }}</ref> Like much of the interstate system in rural Tennessee, priority was generally given to completing rural segments in Middle and West Tennessee over East Tennessee, but the last approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} segment of I-75 in Tennessee, located mostly in Campbell County, was constructed much earlier than most of the rural segments in Tennessee, reportedly due to the influence of then-Congressman and later U.S. Senator [[Howard Baker|Howard Baker Jr.]], who was from that area.<ref>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = Baker, Kefauver Push I-75 Work |url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/596537178/ |work = [[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |location = Knoxville, Tennessee |date = June 10, 1963 |access-date = December 8, 2019 |via = Newspapers.com }}</ref> By 1963, the {{convert|1|mi|km}} section between US 25W in Jellico and the Kentucky state line was open to traffic.<ref>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = State Won't Give I-75 Priority over I-65 |url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/596538099/ |page = 24 |work = Knoxville News Sentinel |location = Knoxville, Tennessee |date = June 12, 1963 |access-date = December 8, 2019 |via = Newspapers.com }}</ref> The 6.8 mile segment between US 25W in Caryville and US 441 in Anderson County was completed in October 1964.

When the western section of [[Interstate 640 (Tennessee)|I-640]] was completed in 1982, I-75 was moved to overlap the [[Interstate Highway System#Three-digit Interstates|auxiliary route]] to divert through traffic away from downtown in preparation for the [[1982 World's Fair]]. This [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] is somewhat unusual in that the exit numbers and mile markers follow the auxiliary route I-640 instead of I-75 mileage.\n\n===Fog hazards===\nAn approximately five mile section of I-75 in northern Bradley and southern McMinn Counties, including the bridge over the Hiwassee River is prone to hazards from dense fog in the morning, which can severely obscure the visibility of drivers. This segment is located near several heavy industries including the [[Resolute Forest Products]] paper mill, formerly [[Bowater]], which operates [[settling basin|settling ponds]] along the interstate. This segment has been the site of several serious multivehicle accidents, the first of which occurred on March 9, 1974, less than three months after the section opened to traffic, and before it had been declared complete.<ref name=times10/> This accident involved 18 vehicles, and killed three and injured 10.<ref name=times10>{{cite news |last = Bregel |first = Emily |date = December 5, 2010 |title = Echoes from the Fog |url = https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2010/dec/05/echoes-from-the-fog/36284/ |work = [[Chattanooga Times Free Press]] |access-date = January 26, 2019 }}</ref> A total of six multivehicle accidents occurred along this stretch in the 1970s.<ref name=times10/> The worst, which took place on November 5, 1978, involved 62 vehicles and injured 46, and took place on the Hiwassee River Bridge.<ref>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = Many Injured in 62-Car Accident |page = 2 |url = https://newspaperarchive.com/greenville-daily-advocate-nov-06-1978-p-2/ |work = [[Greenville Daily Advocate]] |date = November 6, 1978 |access-date = January 17, 2018 }}</ref> After a multivehicle accident on April 15, 1979 which involved 18 vehicles, killed three, and injured 14, TDOT identified the stretch as prone to fog hazards, and agreed to install warning signs with flashing warning lights, which would activate if fog was detected. After this, no serious fog related accidents occurred for more than 11 years.\n\nOn December 11, 1990, a 99 vehicle accident occurred in this same area that resulted in 12 deaths and 56 injuries.<ref>{{cite book |author = National Transportation Safety Board |title = Multiple-vehicle collisions and fire during limited visibility (fog) on Interstate 75 near Calhoun, Tennessee December

existing fog warning lights were reportedly not working on this day.<ref name=\"Season 2, Episode 3\"/> After settling with the family members of accident victims and survivors in court, TDOT instituted several safety measures along this stretch of highway, including re-striping the roadway with extra markings to make it more visible and installing a computerized fog detection system, which contains a warning system with flashing lights, electronic signs, [[variable speed limit]]s, and electronic controlled swing gates which block access to the interstate from six entrance ramps in

I-75 enters the [[East Tennessee]] region following the [[Tennessee Valley]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all the way through [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to near [[Rocky Top, Tennessee|Rocky Top]], then climbs into the [[Cumberland Mountains]] before crossing over into [[Kentucky]] at Jellico.\n\nOf the six states that I-75 traverses, the segment in Tennessee is the shortest, at {{convert|161.86|mi|km}}. Between Chattanooga and Knoxville, I-75 follows the route of [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 11]] (US 11), and from Knoxville into Kentucky it follows the route of [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]]. Beginning in Chattanooga, I-75 follows the route of [[U.S. Route 41|US 41]] for the rest of the length to its southern terminus in [[Miami]].\n\n==Route description==\n===Chattanooga===\n[[File:Cleveland, TN Scenic View.jpg|thumb|Scenic view along Interstate 75 southbound crossing [[White Oak Mountain]]]]\nInterstate 75 enters Tennessee on the eastern side of [[East Ridge, Tennessee|East Ridge]], a southern suburb of [[Chattanooga]]. Less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} mile into Tennessee is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 41]] (US 41/Unsigned [[U.S. Route 76|US 76]]). About a mile later, at exit 2, is a three way interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 24]], which runs west into [[Downtown Chattanooga]] and to [[Nashville]]. At this interchange, I-75 turns northeast, running along the eastern boundary of Chattanooga. Almost two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 320|State Route 320]] (SR 320), which connects to [[East Brainerd, Tennessee|East Brainerd]], and about a half mile later is a three way interchange with the southern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 153|SR 153]], a [[controlled access highway]] that runs northwest to the [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]] and crosses the [[Tennessee River]] on the [[Chickamauga Dam]]. Accessible from the northbound lanes at this interchange is Hamilton Place Boulevard, a connector to [[Hamilton Place (shopping mall)|Hamilton Place Mall]]. The southbound lanes of I-75 are also accessible from an entrance ramp from this road. At this point, I-75 enters a large commercial area dominated by Hamilton Place, and has an interchange with Shallowford Road about a mile later. A few miles later, at exit 7, I-75 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]] southbound, [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US 64]] westbound and [[Tennessee State Route 317|SR 317]] westbound, and begins a concurrency with these respective routes. Turning slightly northeast, the interstate crosses a [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and at exit 9, SR 317 splits off to the east. I-75 then crosses a steep ridge, passing between the [[Enterprise South Industrial Park]] to the west and [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] to the east. A few miles later, in [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]], US 11/64 split off at exit 11, where the route narrows to six lanes. I-75 then turns northwest, and narrows to four lanes.\n\n===Bradley to Loudon counties===\n[[File:TN I75 North-Exit 49.jpg|thumb|left|I-75 northbound in [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]].]]\nA few miles later, I-75 begins a steep ascent up the western slope of [[White Oak Mountain]], where the northbound lanes receive a [[truck climbing lane]]. At this point, the interstate turns northeast, and for the next three miles traverses east northeast over the top of White Oak Mountain, where it crosses into [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley County]]. I-75 then runs for the next several miles through a predominantly wooded and agricultural area and crossing a few ridges before reaching [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]] at an interchange with [[APD-40]] eastbound (US 64 Bypass), a bypass and connector to US 64. Running along the western edge of Cleveland, I-75 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 60|SR 60]] about 4.5 miles later, also crossing [[Candies Creek Ridge]] at this location, and less than 2 miles later, an interchange with [[Paul Huff Parkway]], a major thoroughfare along the northern part of Cleveland. The interstate then leaves Cleveland, and enters rural northern Bradley County, running northeast. Beginning at this point and continuing for nearly 60 miles, I-75 is very straight and flat, with few curves. Nearly the entirety of this section also contains an extremely wide [[median (highway)|median]], mostly separated by trees. In some locations, the north and southbound lanes are as much as a half mile apart.\n\nAbout twelve miles north of the central business district of Cleveland, I-75 curves to the northeast, and crosses the [[Hiwassee River]] into [[McMinn County, Tennessee|McMinn County]], and then curves back to the northwest. This area is extremely susceptible to [[fog]] hazards, which obscures the visibility of drivers, and several bad accidents have occurred on this section as a result. Running through mostly wooded and agricultural areas, I-75 reaches [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]] about 15 miles later, and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 30|SR 30]], a major east-west corridor in East Tennessee. Running through northern McMinn County, the interstate passes near several unincorporated communities, and has interchanges with several secondary state highways. Around mile marker 58, I-75 enters [[Monroe County, Tennessee|Monroe County]], and a few miles later passes near the town of [[Sweetwater, Tennessee|Sweetwater]], containing an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 68|SR 68]], another major primary state highway. A few miles later, I-75 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]]. At exit 72 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 72|SR 72]], which connects to [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], and a few miles later, the highway crosses the [[Tennessee River]] on the [[Mitchell W. Stout]] Memorial Bridges. I-75 then enters a predominantly commercial and residential area, and has an interchange with US 321 and SR 95 in [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]]. These routes also connect to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]]. Curving slightly to the west and then again to the east, I-75 reaches an interchange with I-40 westbound about three miles later, where it begins a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with I-40. About 20 miles west southwest of [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], the concurrent routes widen to six lanes and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] less than a mile later.\n\n===Knoxville===\n{{see also|Interstate 40 in Tennessee#East Tennessee}}\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|right|I-75 north, along its [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|I-40]] east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\nRunning approximately east northeast the two interstates pass through the western suburbs of Knoxville including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]] and [[West Knoxville]]. Along this concurrency exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. At exit 374 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]] (Lovell Road), where the highway widens to eight lanes, and less than two miles later is a four way interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge to the west and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]] to the east. At exit 380 is an interchange with US 11/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|70]] ([[Kingston Pike]]), which connects to the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood and [[West Town Mall]]. About 5 miles later, at an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], the northern bypass around downtown Knoxville, I-75 splits north off of I-40 and onto a concurrency with I-640. Along this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-640 mileage. Heading north, the interstates come to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]] (Western Avenue) about a mile later. About 1.5 miles later is a complicated interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]] southbound, the former route of I-75, and [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], where I-75 splits off.\n\n===Clinch River Valley and Cumberland Mountains===\nLeaving Knoxville, I-75 turns north, crossing several paralleling ridges of the [[Ridge and Valley Appalachians]]. The terrain for the next {{convert|20|mi|km}} of I-75 north of Knoxville are mostly flat. At exit 112 in [[Powell, Tennessee|Powell]], I-75 once again has an interchange with SR 131, and the Interstate narrows from six to four lanes. Entering a rural area, I-75 runs along a creek valley for the next several miles that bisects several ridges in a crooked and hazardous segment marked by several S-curves. Maintaining its north-northwesterly direction, I-75 crosses into [[Anderson County, Tennessee|Anderson County]]. Beyond this section, the [[Cumberland Mountains]] become visible in the distance. At exit 122 the Interstate has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route|SR 61]] near [[Clinton, Tennessee|Clinton]]. I-75 then descends sharply into a valley, crossing the Clinch River a few miles later. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, near the community of [[Rocky Top, Tennessee|Rocky Top]], I-75 has interchanges with US 441, and US 25W, running concurrently with the latter. The Interstate then crosses into [[Campbell County, Tennessee|Campbell County]].\n\n[[File:I 75 Jellico Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|View from I-75 on top of Jellico Mountain near the Kentucky border.]]\nFor approximately the last {{convert|30|mi|km}} in Tennessee, I-75 traverses the Cumberland Mountains. This entire section is considered very scenic and is prone to rockslides in many locations. Around milepost 130, I-75 begins its first major ascent for a few miles before leveling out on one of the plateaus of Cumberland Mountains, and at exit 134, near the community of [[Caryville, Tennessee|Caryville]], US 25W splits off and I-75 begins a concurrency with [[Tennessee State Route 63|SR 63]]. The Interstate then begins another ascent, adding a truck climbing lane going northbound. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway levels out on another one of the plateaus and the truck lane terminates. Less than a mile later, SR 63 splits off near the unincorporated community of [[Pioneer, Tennessee|Pioneer]]. Traveling through a further sparsely populated rural area marked by dense woodlands, I-75 remains relatively flat for the next few miles before beginning another ascent up the Cumberland Mountains, once again adding a truck climbing lane. [[Jellico Mountain]] is a sub-mountain range of the Cumberland Mountains that the interstate traverses near Jellico. I-75 curves sharply to the northeast and about a mile later, it reaches the crests of Jellico Mountain where the truck lane ends. The interstate then climbs the crests of Jellico Mountain for about another {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} before levelling out on top of Jellico Mountain at an elevation of about {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} and has an interchange with US 25W in the city of [[Jellico, Tennessee|Jellico]]. Less than a mile later, I-75 enters the hilly terrains of eastern Kentucky.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nConstruction of I-75 in Tennessee began in 1958 with short segments in Chattanooga and Knoxville.

This [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] is somewhat unusual in that the exit numbers and mile markers follow the auxiliary route I-640 instead of I-75 mileage.\n\n===Fog hazards===\nAn approximately five mile section of I-75 in northern Bradley and southern McMinn Counties, including the bridge over the Hiwassee River is prone to hazards from dense fog in the morning, which can severely obscure the visibility of drivers. This segment is located near several heavy industries including the [[Resolute Forest Products]] paper mill, formerly [[Bowater]], which operates [[settling basin|settling ponds]] along the interstate. This segment has been the site of several serious multivehicle accidents, the first of which occurred on March 9, 1974, less than three months after the section opened to traffic, and before it had been declared complete.<ref name=times10/> This accident involved 18 vehicles, and killed three and injured 10.<ref name=times10>{{cite news |last = Bregel |first = Emily |date = December 5, 2010 |title = Echoes from the Fog |url = https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2010/dec/05/echoes-from-the-fog/36284/ |work = [[Chattanooga Times Free Press]] |access-date = January 26, 2019 }}</ref> A total of six multivehicle accidents occurred along this stretch in the 1970s.<ref name=times10/> The worst, which took place on November 5, 1978, involved 62 vehicles and injured 46, and took place on the Hiwassee River Bridge.<ref>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title = Many Injured in 62-Car Accident |page = 2 |url = https://newspaperarchive.com/greenville-daily-advocate-nov-06-1978-p-2/ |work = [[Greenville Daily Advocate]] |date = November 6, 1978 |access-date = January 17, 2018 }}</ref> After a multivehicle accident on April 15, 1979 which involved 18 vehicles, killed three, and injured 14, TDOT identified the stretch as prone to fog hazards, and agreed to install warning signs with flashing warning lights, which would activate if fog was detected.

Just as the story is about to hit the presses, Tom McDonald finds out the evening's headline is about his son Ray. After reading the article, Tom knows in his heart, Ray could not be guilty of any bribery charge. Tom becomes enraged and attempts to destroy the press.\n\nTom's attempted destruction fails. During this time, the entire Chronicle plant burns to the ground. Tom is blamed for the fire. He is immediately thrown in jail, coincidently in the same cell as his son.\n\nClarence believes Tom when he says his son is innocent. Clarence teams up with Polly to investigate the circumstances surrounding the bribery charge. After working together, they uncover evidence exonerating both father and son.
