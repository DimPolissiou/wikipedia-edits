Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

These include ensuring that torture is a criminal offense under a party's [[municipal law]] (Article 4), establishing jurisdiction over acts of torture committed by or against a party's nationals (Article 5), ensuring that torture is an [[extradition|extraditable]] offense (Article 8), and establishing [[universal jurisdiction]] to try cases of torture where an alleged torturer cannot be extradited (Article 5). Parties must promptly investigate any allegation of torture (Articles 12 and 13), and victims of torture, or their dependents in case victims died as a result of torture, must have an enforceable right to compensation (Article 14). Parties must also ban the use of [[evidence]] produced by torture in their courts (Article 15), and are barred from [[Deportation|deporting]], extraditing, or [[Non-refoulement|refouling]] people where there are substantial grounds for believing they will be tortured (Article 3).\n\nParties are required to train and educate their [[Law enforcement officer|law enforcement personnel]], [[civilian]] or [[military personnel]], [[Medic|medical personnel]], [[Official|public officials]], and other persons involved in the [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]], [[interrogation]], or treatment of any individual subjected to any form of [[arrest]], detention, or [[imprisonment]], regarding the prohibition against torture (Article 10). Parties also must keep interrogation rules, instructions, methods, and practices under systematic review regarding individuals who are under custody or physical control in any territory under their jurisdiction, in order to prevent all acts of torture (Article 11). Parties are also obliged to prevent all acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in any territory under their jurisdiction, and to investigate any allegation of such treatment. (Article 16).\n\n'''Part II''' (Articles 17\u201324) governs reporting and monitoring of the Convention and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It establishes the [[Committee Against Torture (UN)|Committee against Torture]] (Article 17), and empowers it to investigate allegations of systematic torture (Article 20). It also establishes an optional dispute-resolution mechanism between parties (Article 21) and allows parties to recognize the competence of the Committee to hear complaints from individuals about violations of the Convention by a party (Article 22).\n\n'''Part III''' (Articles 25\u201333) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Convention. It also includes an optional arbitration mechanism for disputes between parties (Article 30).\n\n== Main provisions ==\n\n=== Definition of torture ===\n\n'''Article 1.1''' of the Convention defines torture as:\n\n{{quote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.}}\n\nThe words \"inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions\" remain vague and very broad. It is extremely difficult to determine what sanctions are 'inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions' in a particular legal system and what are not. The drafters of the Convention neither provided any criteria for making such determination nor did it define the terms. The nature of the findings would so differ from one legal system to another that they would give rise to serious disputes among the Parties to the Convention. It was suggested that the reference to such rules would make the issue more complicated, for it would endow the rules with a semblance of legal binding force. This allows state parties to pass domestic laws that permit acts of torture that they believe are within the lawful sanctions clause. However, the most widely adopted interpretation of the lawful sanctions clause is that it refers to sanctions authorized by [[international law]]. Pursuant to this interpretation, only sanctions that are authorized by international law will fall within this exclusion. The interpretation of the lawful sanctions clause leaves no scope of application and is widely debated by authors, historians, and scholars alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Freedom, Torture and International Human Rights: Challenging the Masculinisation of Torture |page=145 |date=December 4, 2013 |author=Ronli Sifris |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Ban on torture ===\n'''Article 2''' prohibits torture, and requires parties to take effective measures to prevent it in any territory under their jurisdiction.

against Torture (CAT) is a body of human rights experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by State parties. The Committee is one of eight UN-linked human rights treaty bodies. All state parties are obliged under the Convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the Convention, states must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of \"concluding observations.\" Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated.\n\nThe CAT usually meets in April/May and November each year in [[Geneva]]. Members are elected to four-year terms by State parties and can be re-elected if nominated.

To help achieve its ambitious goals, the CTI identifies and addresses challenges and barriers to ratification and implementation of the [[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]] by harnessing international cooperation, diplomacy, dialogue, knowledge transfer, ideas and technical resources sharing to support capacity building and adaptation of best practices..\n\nSince its inception, the CTI has evolved into a comprehensive hub and global platform for countries supported by a Group of Friends comprising UN member states, NGOs, torture prevention experts, academicians and a wealth of related subject matter experts'''.\u00a0''' In February 2019, during the [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session40/Pages/40RegularSession.aspx 40th session of the Human Rights Council] \u2013 and at the half-way milestone of the CTI \u2013 Fiji joined the CTI Core States, driving ratification and implementation in the Pacific and beyond. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the CTI is supported by a full-time Secretariat headed by Dr. Alice Edwards. [https://apt.ch/ The Association for the Prevention of Torture] (APT) is a strategic partner that collaborates and advises on CTI activities and events.\n\nNow at the midway point of its 10-year endeavor, CTI2024 is galvanizing efforts in the remaining five to increase awareness of the benefits of the Convention, which includes State-to-State support and encouragement, experience sharing, development of science-based tools and methodologies and sharing globally accepted best practices.\n\n=== Relevance in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century ===\nThe reality is, no country is immune from torture and other abuses to its citizenry. The persistence of torture and various forms of abuse and ill-treatment \u2013 and governments\u2019 willingness to use such damaging methods of interrogation and control \u2013 demands a robust, sustained and viable response. Despite punitive sanctions coupled with the threat of being labelled a pariah state and international condemnation, abuses continue to be perpetrated in myriad countries across all regions of the globe. In some countries, the abuses are clear; in others, systems of justice lack clearly defined, stringent safeguards and institutional structures that act as deterrence, which can result in incidences and patterns of unacceptable behavior.\n\nOn 26 June 1987, [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx the United Nations adopted the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishmen]t, known as [[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]].  UNCAT aims to prohibit, prevent and respond to torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in every nation-state. The UN Convention reinforces that torture is never justified, under any circumstance. The 1984 adoption of UNCAT was a landmark victory in the global fight against torture and ill-treatment.\n\n[[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]] goes beyond policies and protocols and is arguably the most practical of the other global human rights treaties. It offers a practical, actionable framework for integrating institutional, legislative and executive measures to combat lacunae in laws and practices and respond to government excesses. Acknowledging that some countries lack the knowledge, experience and pragmatic means of putting the treaty into practice at home, the CTI provides operational advice, tools, training and resources to assist decision-makers and public authorities in halting, preventing and safeguarding against torture and ill-treatment. Consequently, the CTI provides the means of making ratification effective before and after signing, buttressed by a package of support and resources for newly ratifying countries.\n\nAs CTI reaches its five year anniversary, the initiative is partnering with governments to reinforcing efforts to build and sustain rule of law and the fair and effective administration of justice in their home countries through technical support for infrastructure building, sharing evidence-based recommendations, best practices, institutional engagement among others. As the primary facilitator of government-to-government dialogue, and the only state-led initiative of its kind, CTI is a hub for the convening of a wide range of stakeholders including government ministers, civil society members, scholars, legal and law enforcement officials, and other related experts and stakeholders. To date, the achievements of CTI are impressive, with 15 new ratifications in five years, the attendance of over 140 governments at ministerial or senior official level at CTI regional events and seminars; and the implementation of over 80 good practices within various countries.\n\n==== Benefits ====\nImplementable tools and resources<ref name=\"Why Ratify\">{{Cite web |url=https://cti2024.org/en/why-ratify-uncat/ |title=CTI Convention against Torture Initiative {{!}} 10 good reasons to ratify UNCAT |website=cti2024.org |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n* Dialogue and government-to-government engagement\n* International Cooperation and Diplomacy\n* Experience and Idea Sharing\n* Technical Support and Capacity Building\n* Awareness raising\n* Seminars, activities and conferences\n\n==== History of CTI ====\nIn commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention against Torture and with the desire to do something more profound to combat torture and ill-treatment, the CTI was launched at a high-level event during the [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session25/Pages/25RegularSession.aspx 25th session of the Human Rights Council] in Geneva.\n\nIn late 2013, the regionally diverse governments of Chile, Denmark, Ghana, Indonesia and Morocco (known as the CTI Core States) emphasised the need for more rigorous, practical, real world efforts that protect all persons from torture, forms of abuse and ill-treatment throughout the world. Launched in 2014 during a high-level meeting of [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session25/Pages/25RegularSession.aspx the 25th session of the Human Rights Council] in Geneva. CTI is a unique, innovative initiative that supports and enables governments to better protect individuals from torture and ill-treatment.\n\nAchieving [https://www.cti2024.org/en/objectives/ CTI objectives] is dependent on governments\u2019 openness and willingness to exchange, learn from and apply new methodologies, and to view adhering to international obligations as means to enjoy multiple direct and indirect benefits at national and local levels.

CTI operates under the core guiding principle of states\u2019 ability to achieve progress through dialogue, cooperation, knowledge transfer, sharing of best practices and experience and other methods. Purposefully, CTI does not name or shame governments into action. Rather, CTI relies on political willingness, understanding, and constructive and respectful dialogue. This collaborative approach allows States to discuss sensitive issues they may not otherwise discuss in other settings.\n\n===== Twinning =====\nCTI seeks to facilitate exchange of experiences and knowledge transfer among States encourage and support learning from others with similar challenges, through regional or sub-regional settings.\n\n===== Inspirational =====\nCTI aims to inspire, facilitate and motivate States progress toward ratification by highlighting \u00a0countries\u2019 \u00a0positive experiences through peer-to-peer bilateral and multilateral engagement and the development of practical, actionable tools.\n\nThe CTI is proud and encouraged by the many significant progress to date, including 15 new ratifications, the attendance of over 140 governments at ministerial or senior government official levels, at CTI regional events and seminars and the implementation of over 80 CTI best practices in various countries.\n\n===== Relations with United Nations =====\nWorking with UN Member States, CTI works to galvanise and deepen support for the UN Convention against Torture \u2013 both inside and outside the mechanisms of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, the human rights home of the United Nations, the CTI capitalises on bilateral and multilateral opportunities for awareness-raising, information-sharing and promoting ratification'''<sup>[1]</sup>''' and implementation of UNCAT through the various UN fora. This includes [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRbodies/HRC/Pages/Home.aspx the UN Human Rights Council], [[Universal Periodic Review|the Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR), and the deliberations of the various UN torture-relevant bodies, namely the UN Committee against Torture (UNCAT), the Sub-Committee on the Prevention of Torture [LINK: <nowiki>https://ijrcenter.org/un-treaty-bodies/subcommittee-on-prevention-of-torture/</nowiki>, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture [LINK: <nowiki>https://ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/special-rapporteur-on-torture-and-other-cruel-inhuman-or-degrading-treatment-or-punishment/</nowiki>], and [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/UNVFT/Pages/WhattheFunddoes.aspx the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture].

These include ensuring that torture is a criminal offense under a party's [[municipal law]] (Article 4), establishing jurisdiction over acts of torture committed by or against a party's nationals (Article 5), ensuring that torture is an [[extradition|extraditable]] offense (Article 8), and establishing [[universal jurisdiction]] to try cases of torture where an alleged torturer cannot be extradited (Article 5). Parties must promptly investigate any allegation of torture (Articles 12 and 13), and victims of torture, or their dependents in case victims died as a result of torture, must have an enforceable right to compensation (Article 14). Parties must also ban the use of [[evidence]] produced by torture in their courts (Article 15), and are barred from [[Deportation|deporting]], extraditing, or [[Non-refoulement|refouling]] people where there are substantial grounds for believing they will be tortured (Article 3).\n\nParties are required to train and educate their [[Law enforcement officer|law enforcement personnel]], [[civilian]] or [[military personnel]], [[Medic|medical personnel]], [[Official|public officials]], and other persons involved in the [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]], [[interrogation]], or treatment of any individual subjected to any form of [[arrest]], detention, or [[imprisonment]], regarding the prohibition against torture (Article 10). Parties also must keep interrogation rules, instructions, methods, and practices under systematic review regarding individuals who are under custody or physical control in any territory under their jurisdiction, in order to prevent all acts of torture (Article 11). Parties are also obliged to prevent all acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in any territory under their jurisdiction, and to investigate any allegation of such treatment. (Article 16).\n\n'''Part II''' (Articles 17\u201324) governs reporting and monitoring of the Convention and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It establishes the [[Committee Against Torture (UN)|Committee against Torture]] (Article 17), and empowers it to investigate allegations of systematic torture (Article 20). It also establishes an optional dispute-resolution mechanism between parties (Article 21) and allows parties to recognize the competence of the Committee to hear complaints from individuals about violations of the Convention by a party (Article 22).\n\n'''Part III''' (Articles 25\u201333) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Convention. It also includes an optional arbitration mechanism for disputes between parties (Article 30).\n\n== Main provisions ==\n\n=== Definition of torture ===\n\n'''Article 1.1''' of the Convention defines torture as:\n\n{{quote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.}}\n\nThe words \"inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions\" remain vague and very broad. It is extremely difficult to determine what sanctions are 'inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions' in a particular legal system and what are not. The drafters of the Convention neither provided any criteria for making such determination nor did it define the terms. The nature of the findings would so differ from one legal system to another that they would give rise to serious disputes among the Parties to the Convention. It was suggested that the reference to such rules would make the issue more complicated, for it would endow the rules with a semblance of legal binding force. This allows state parties to pass domestic laws that permit acts of torture that they believe are within the lawful sanctions clause. However, the most widely adopted interpretation of the lawful sanctions clause is that it refers to sanctions authorized by [[international law]]. Pursuant to this interpretation, only sanctions that are authorized by international law will fall within this exclusion. The interpretation of the lawful sanctions clause leaves no scope of application and is widely debated by authors, historians, and scholars alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Freedom, Torture and International Human Rights: Challenging the Masculinisation of Torture |page=145 |date=December 4, 2013 |author=Ronli Sifris |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Ban on torture ===\n'''Article 2''' prohibits torture, and requires parties to take effective measures to prevent it in any territory under their jurisdiction.

Because it is often difficult to distinguish between cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment and torture, the Committee regards Article 16's prohibition of such act as similarly absolute and non-derogable.<ref name=GC2/>\n\n== Signatories and ratifications ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

against Torture (CAT) is a body of human rights experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by State parties. The Committee is one of eight UN-linked human rights treaty bodies. All state parties are obliged under the Convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the Convention, states must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of \"concluding observations.\" Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated.\n\nThe CAT usually meets in April/May and November each year in [[Geneva]]. Members are elected to four-year terms by State parties and can be re-elected if nominated.

To help achieve its ambitious goals, the CTI identifies and addresses challenges and barriers to ratification and implementation of the [[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]] by harnessing international cooperation, diplomacy, dialogue, knowledge transfer, ideas and technical resources sharing to support capacity building and adaptation of best practices..\n\nSince its inception, the CTI has evolved into a comprehensive hub and global platform for countries supported by a Group of Friends comprising UN member states, NGOs, torture prevention experts, academicians and a wealth of related subject matter experts'''.\u00a0''' In February 2019, during the [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session40/Pages/40RegularSession.aspx 40th session of the Human Rights Council] \u2013 and at the half-way milestone of the CTI \u2013 Fiji joined the CTI Core States, driving ratification and implementation in the Pacific and beyond. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the CTI is supported by a full-time Secretariat headed by Dr. Alice Edwards. [https://apt.ch/ The Association for the Prevention of Torture] (APT) is a strategic partner that collaborates and advises on CTI activities and events.\n\nNow at the midway point of its 10-year endeavor, CTI2024 is galvanizing efforts in the remaining five to increase awareness of the benefits of the Convention, which includes State-to-State support and encouragement, experience sharing, development of science-based tools and methodologies and sharing globally accepted best practices.\n\n=== Relevance in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century ===\nThe reality is, no country is immune from torture and other abuses to its citizenry. The persistence of torture and various forms of abuse and ill-treatment \u2013 and governments\u2019 willingness to use such damaging methods of interrogation and control \u2013 demands a robust, sustained and viable response. Despite punitive sanctions coupled with the threat of being labelled a pariah state and international condemnation, abuses continue to be perpetrated in myriad countries across all regions of the globe. In some countries, the abuses are clear; in others, systems of justice lack clearly defined, stringent safeguards and institutional structures that act as deterrence, which can result in incidences and patterns of unacceptable behavior.\n\nOn 26 June 1987, [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx the United Nations adopted the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishmen]t, known as [[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]].  UNCAT aims to prohibit, prevent and respond to torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in every nation-state. The UN Convention reinforces that torture is never justified, under any circumstance. The 1984 adoption of UNCAT was a landmark victory in the global fight against torture and ill-treatment.\n\n[[United Nations Convention against Torture|UNCAT]] goes beyond policies and protocols and is arguably the most practical of the other global human rights treaties. It offers a practical, actionable framework for integrating institutional, legislative and executive measures to combat lacunae in laws and practices and respond to government excesses. Acknowledging that some countries lack the knowledge, experience and pragmatic means of putting the treaty into practice at home, the CTI provides operational advice, tools, training and resources to assist decision-makers and public authorities in halting, preventing and safeguarding against torture and ill-treatment. Consequently, the CTI provides the means of making ratification effective before and after signing, buttressed by a package of support and resources for newly ratifying countries.\n\nAs CTI reaches its five year anniversary, the initiative is partnering with governments to reinforcing efforts to build and sustain rule of law and the fair and effective administration of justice in their home countries through technical support for infrastructure building, sharing evidence-based recommendations, best practices, institutional engagement among others. As the primary facilitator of government-to-government dialogue, and the only state-led initiative of its kind, CTI is a hub for the convening of a wide range of stakeholders including government ministers, civil society members, scholars, legal and law enforcement officials, and other related experts and stakeholders. To date, the achievements of CTI are impressive, with 15 new ratifications in five years, the attendance of over 140 governments at ministerial or senior official level at CTI regional events and seminars; and the implementation of over 80 good practices within various countries.\n\n==== Benefits ====\nImplementable tools and resources<ref name=\"Why Ratify\">{{Cite web |url=https://cti2024.org/en/why-ratify-uncat/ |title=CTI Convention against Torture Initiative {{!}} 10 good reasons to ratify UNCAT |website=cti2024.org |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n* Dialogue and government-to-government engagement\n* International Cooperation and Diplomacy\n* Experience and Idea Sharing\n* Technical Support and Capacity Building\n* Awareness raising\n* Seminars, activities and conferences\n\n==== History of CTI ====\nIn commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention against Torture and with the desire to do something more profound to combat torture and ill-treatment, the CTI was launched at a high-level event during the [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session25/Pages/25RegularSession.aspx 25th session of the Human Rights Council] in Geneva.\n\nIn late 2013, the regionally diverse governments of Chile, Denmark, Ghana, Indonesia and Morocco (known as the CTI Core States) emphasised the need for more rigorous, practical, real world efforts that protect all persons from torture, forms of abuse and ill-treatment throughout the world. Launched in 2014 during a high-level meeting of [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session25/Pages/25RegularSession.aspx the 25th session of the Human Rights Council] in Geneva. CTI is a unique, innovative initiative that supports and enables governments to better protect individuals from torture and ill-treatment.\n\nAchieving [https://www.cti2024.org/en/objectives/ CTI objectives] is dependent on governments\u2019 openness and willingness to exchange, learn from and apply new methodologies, and to view adhering to international obligations as means to enjoy multiple direct and indirect benefits at national and local levels.

CTI operates under the core guiding principle of states\u2019 ability to achieve progress through dialogue, cooperation, knowledge transfer, sharing of best practices and experience and other methods. Purposefully, CTI does not name or shame governments into action. Rather, CTI relies on political willingness, understanding, and constructive and respectful dialogue. This collaborative approach allows States to discuss sensitive issues they may not otherwise discuss in other settings.\n\n===== Twinning =====\nCTI seeks to facilitate exchange of experiences and knowledge transfer among States encourage and support learning from others with similar challenges, through regional or sub-regional settings.\n\n===== Inspirational =====\nCTI aims to inspire, facilitate and motivate States progress toward ratification by highlighting \u00a0countries\u2019 \u00a0positive experiences through peer-to-peer bilateral and multilateral engagement and the development of practical, actionable tools.\n\nThe CTI is proud and encouraged by the many significant progress to date, including 15 new ratifications, the attendance of over 140 governments at ministerial or senior government official levels, at CTI regional events and seminars and the implementation of over 80 CTI best practices in various countries.\n\n===== Relations with United Nations =====\nWorking with UN Member States, CTI works to galvanise and deepen support for the UN Convention against Torture \u2013 both inside and outside the mechanisms of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, the human rights home of the United Nations, the CTI capitalises on bilateral and multilateral opportunities for awareness-raising, information-sharing and promoting ratification'''<sup>'''<sup>[1]</sup>'''</sup>''' and implementation of UNCAT through the various UN fora.

In pipes and tubes with smooth inner linings, fluid near the containing wall flows only slightly slower than fluid in the central channel of the pipe; thus, the whole volume of fluid flows [[laminar flow|smoothly and freely]]. When fluid encounters an obstruction, a resulting swirl of water starts trapping debris.\n\nAn obstruction can be any type of rough surface capable of snagging debris. In brick or concrete sewers there may be surplus cement drips, damaged brickwork, or loose mortar joints damaged by [[Frost heaving|frost heave]]. In any sub-surface pipe, even of the most advanced design, penetration by foreign intrusions such as tree roots is a commonplace cause of a fatberg blockage.\n\nIn sewers carrying alkaline fluids, [[lipid]]s can become calcified and solidify.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/18/dont-feed-fatberg-museum-london-clogging-sewers-oil|title=Don\u2019t feed the fatberg!

In pipes and tubes with smooth inner linings, fluid near the containing wall flows only slightly slower than fluid in the central channel of the pipe; thus, the whole volume of fluid flows [[laminar flow|smoothly and freely]]. When fluid encounters an obstruction, a resulting swirl of water starts trapping debris.\n\nAn obstruction can be any type of rough surface capable of snagging debris. In brick or concrete sewers there may be surplus cement drips, damaged brickwork, or loose mortar joints damaged by [[Frost heaving|frost heave]]. In any sub-surface pipe, even of the most advanced design, penetration by foreign intrusions such as tree roots is a commonplace cause of a fatberg blockage.\n\nIn sewers carrying alkaline fluids, [[lipid]]s can become calcified and solidify.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/18/dont-feed-fatberg-museum-london-clogging-sewers-oil|title=Don\u2019t feed the fatberg!

Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's.

Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerlessness (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that:\n{{quote|movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than \u2026 perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.<ref>M.A. Chaudhary & Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has suggested that identity politics causes (rather than simply recognizing and acting on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying:\n{{quote|[[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, \u2026 a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview\u2014which has nothing to do with the world\u2014from any questioning.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|access-date=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173221/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|archive-date=30 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\nIn these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.\n\nIn this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ...

Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerlessness (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that:\n{{quote|movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than \u2026 perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.<ref>M.A. Chaudhary & Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has suggested that identity politics causes (rather than simply recognizing and acting on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying:\n{{quote|[[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, \u2026 a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview\u2014which has nothing to do with the world\u2014from any questioning.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|access-date=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173221/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|archive-date=30 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\nIn these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.\n\nIn this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ...
