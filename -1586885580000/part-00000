This was created roughly between 10,000 and 5,500 years ago, and painted in rock shelters under cliffs or shallow caves, in contrast to the recesses of deep caves used in the earlier (and much colder) period.  Although individual figures are less naturalistic, they are grouped in coherent grouped compositions to a much greater degree.\n\n== Subjects, themes, and patterns ==\n[[File:Rock art bull.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting of animals at Albarrac\u00edn, Teruel, Spain ([[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]])]]\nThe most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as [[bison]], [[horse]]s, [[aurochs]], and [[deer]], and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called [[finger flutings]]. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example, the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where [[equine]] species are the most common.  Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. Kieran D. O'Hara, geologist, suggests in his book ''Cave Art and Climate Change'' that climate controlled the themes depicted.<ref>O'Hara, K. (2014). Cave Art and Climate Change, Archway Publishing.</ref>\nPigments used include red and yellow [[ochre]], [[hematite]], [[manganese oxide]] and [[charcoal]]. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first, and in some caves all or many of the images are only engraved in this fashion, taking them somewhat out of a strict definition of \"cave painting\".\n\nSimilarly, large animals are also the most common subjects in the many small carved and engraved bone or ivory (less often stone) pieces dating from the same periods.  But these include the group of [[Venus figurine]]s, which have no real equivalent in cave paintings.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nHand stencils, made by placing a hand on the wall and blowing pigment at it (probably through a pipe of some kind), form a characteristic image of a roughly round area of solid pigment with the uncoloured shape of the hand in the centre, which may then be decorated with lines or dashes. Often, these are found in the same caves as other paintings, or may be the only form of painting in a location. Some walls contain many hand stencils.  Similar hands are also painted in the usual fashion. A number of hands show a finger wholly or partly missing, for which a number of explanations have been given. Hand images are found in similar forms in Europe, Eastern Asia and South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/hands/|title=Hand Paintings and Symbols in Rock Art|first=Bradshaw|last=Foundation|work=bradshawfoundation.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Theories and interpretations ===\n[[File:Bestias11.JPG|thumb|Rock paintings from the [[Cave of Beasts]] ([[Gilf Kebir]], [[Libyan Desert]]) Estimated 7000 [[Before Present|BP]] ]]\n[[Henri Breuil]] interpreted the paintings as [[hunting magic]] to increase the abundance of prey.\n\nAnother theory, developed by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic [[Shamanism|shamans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitley|first=David S.|title=Cave Paintings and the Human Spirit: The Origin of Creativity and Belief|year=2009|publisher= Prometheus|isbn= 978-1-59102-636-5|page=35}}</ref> The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing out power from the cave walls themselves.\n\nR. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and age among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the [[Venus figurines]]) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the [[prehistoric demography|human population at the time]].<ref name=guthrie>{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=R.

This was created roughly between 10,000 and 5,500 years ago, and painted in rock shelters under cliffs or shallow caves, in contrast to the recesses of deep caves used in the earlier (and much colder) period.  Although individual figures are less naturalistic, they are grouped in coherent grouped compositions to a much greater degree.\n\n== Subjects, themes, and patterns ==\n[[File:Rock art bull.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting of animals at Albarrac\u00edn, Teruel, Spain ([[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]])]]\nThe most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as [[bison]], [[horse]]s, [[aurochs]], and [[deer]], and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called [[finger flutings]]. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example, the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where [[equine]] species are the most common.  Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. Kieran D. O'Hara, geologist, suggests in his book ''Cave Art and Climate Change'' that climate controlled the themes depicted.<ref>O'Hara, K. (2014). Cave Art and Climate Change, Archway Publishing.</ref>\nPigments used include red and yellow [[ochre]], [[hematite]], [[manganese oxide]] and [[charcoal]]. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first, and in some caves all or many of the images are only engraved in this fashion, taking them somewhat out of a strict definition of \"cave painting\".\n\nSimilarly, large animals are also the most common subjects in the many small carved and engraved bone or ivory (less often stone) pieces dating from the same periods.  But these include the group of [[Venus figurine]]s, which have no real equivalent in cave paintings.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nHand stencils, made by placing a hand on the wall and blowing pigment at it (probably through a pipe of some kind), form a characteristic image of a roughly round area of solid pigment with the uncoloured shape of the hand in the centre, which may then be decorated with lines or dashes. Often, these are found in the same caves as other paintings, or may be the only form of painting in a location. Some walls contain many hand stencils.  Similar hands are also painted in the usual fashion. A number of hands show a finger wholly or partly missing, for which a number of explanations have been given. Hand images are found in similar forms in Europe, Eastern Asia and South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/hands/|title=Hand Paintings and Symbols in Rock Art|first=Bradshaw|last=Foundation|work=bradshawfoundation.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Theories and interpretations ===\n[[File:Bestias11.JPG|thumb|Rock paintings from the [[Cave of Beasts]] ([[Gilf Kebir]], [[Libyan Desert]]) Estimated 7000 [[Before Present|BP]] ]]\n[[Henri Breuil]] interpreted the paintings as [[hunting magic]] to increase the abundance of prey.\n\nAnother theory, developed by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic [[Shamanism|shamans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitley|first=David S.|title=Cave Paintings and the Human Spirit: The Origin of Creativity and Belief|year=2009|publisher= Prometheus|isbn= 978-1-59102-636-5|page=35}}</ref> The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing out power from the cave walls themselves.\n\nR. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and age among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the [[Venus figurines]]) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the [[prehistoric demography|human population at the time]].<ref name=guthrie>{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=R.

The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.\n\nThe monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and  [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.\n\nThe British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House.

Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II.

When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition.

The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day > Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: \"the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;... three rights \u2013 the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\"<ref>Bagehot, p.75</ref>\n\nAlthough the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, \"The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers\", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.<ref name=PASC>{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.<ref name=PASC/>\n\nIt is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons.

For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally.

[[Alfred the Great]] secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western [[Mercia]], and assumed the title \"King of the English\".<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12\u201313 and 31</ref> His grandson [[\u00c6thelstan]] was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13\u201317</ref> The [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the [[Feudalism|Feudal System]] continued to develop.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102\u2013127</ref>\n\nWilliam was succeeded by two of his sons: [[William II of England|William II]], then [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]], laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]]. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as [[the Anarchy]]. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin king of England]] and the first monarch of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] as Henry II in 1154.<ref>Fraser, pp.30\u201346</ref>\n\nThe reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs [[Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the [[Angevin Empire]]. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the [[Crusades]]. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.\n\nJohn's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing [[Magna Carta]] ([[Latin]] for \"Great Charter\") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the [[First Barons' War]]. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Fraser, pp.54\u201374</ref> Later in Henry's reign, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the [[Second Barons' War]]. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265.<ref>Fraser, pp.77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe next monarch, [[Edward Longshanks]], was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]]. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, [[Edward II]], who also faced conflict with the nobility.<ref>Fraser, pp.79\u201393</ref> In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of [[Ordinances of 1311|baronial \"ordainers\"]]; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322.<ref>Ashley, pp.595\u2013597</ref> Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. His 14-year-old son became [[Edward III]]. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.\n\nHis campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson [[Richard II]]. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]] seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.<ref>Fraser, pp.96\u2013115</ref>\n\nHenry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]]; hence, his dynasty was known as the [[House of Lancaster]]. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.<ref>Fraser, pp.118\u2013130</ref>\n\nThe unpopularity of Henry VI's counsellors and his belligerent consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, [[Edward IV]], led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The [[Wars of the Roses]], nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son [[Edward V]] and brother [[Richard III]]. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].<ref>Fraser, pp.133\u2013165</ref>\n\nNow King Henry VII, he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168\u2013176</ref> The reign of the second Tudor king, [[Henry VIII]], was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the [[Pope]] led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the [[Church of England]] (the Anglican Church).<ref>Fraser, pp.179\u2013189</ref>\n\nWales \u2013 which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion \u2013 was annexed to England under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]].<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309</ref> Henry VIII's son and successor, the young [[Edward VI]], continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating [[Lady Jane Grey]] as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister [[Elizabeth I]]. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.<ref>Ashley, pp.636\u2013647 and Fraser, pp.190\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Scottish monarchy===\n{{See also|List of Scottish monarchs}}\nIn Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the [[Picts]] in the north east, the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in the south, including the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and the [[Gaels]] or [[Scoti|Scotti]] (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the west. [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] to the Scots).<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1\u201312, 35</ref> The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.\n\nEarly Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of [[tanistry]] was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the [[House of Alpin]]. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle.<ref>Weir, pp.164\u2013177</ref> In 1005, [[Malcolm II]] ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, [[Duncan I]], instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]], who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson [[Lulach]], Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.<ref>Ashley, pp.390\u2013395</ref>\n\nWith a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. David was succeeded by his grandsons [[Malcolm IV]], and then by [[William the Lion]], the longest-reigning King of Scots before the [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>Ashley, pp.400\u2013407 and Weir, pp.185\u2013198</ref> William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.170</ref> William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]]. Alexander II, as well as his successor [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], attempted to take over the [[Western Isles]], which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing [[Treaty of Perth]] recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.<ref>Ashley, pp.407\u2013409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196</ref>\n\nAlexander III's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]]. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|13 rival claimants to the throne]]. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced [[John Balliol]] to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Scotland had no monarch, until [[Robert the Bruce]] declared himself king in 1306.<ref>Ashley, pp.409\u2013412</ref>\n\nRobert's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, [[Edward Balliol]], the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.<ref>Ashley, pp.549\u2013552</ref>\n\nDavid II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] of the [[House of Stuart]]. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, [[regent]]s had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son [[James I of Scotland|James I]], had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. [[James II of Scotland|James II]] continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: [[James IV]].<ref>Ashley, pp.552\u2013565</ref>\n\nIn 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden Field]]; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, [[James V]], was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]]. Once again, a regency was established.\n\nMary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as [[John Knox]], a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son [[James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Ashley, pp.567\u2013575</ref>\n\n===Personal union and republican phase===\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.]]\nElizabeth I's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch [[James VI]], who was the great-grandson of [[Henry VIII]]'s older sister and hence Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\". Although England and Scotland were in [[personal union]] under one monarch \u2013 James I became the first monarch to style himself \"King of Great Britain\" in 1604<ref>Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604</ref> \u2013 they remained two separate kingdoms. James I's successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and the English [[Puritans]]). His attempt to enforce [[Anglicanism]] led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the \"[[Bishops' Wars]]\") and ignited the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the [[English Civil War]] began.<ref>Fraser, pp.214\u2013231</ref>\n\nThe Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]]. In 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]], the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself [[Lord Protector]] (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393\u2013400</ref> The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] and Charles II returned to Britain.<ref>Fraser, p.232</ref>\n\nCharles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] arose; the \"Petitioners\", who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the \"Abhorrers\", who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison [[Seven Bishops|Church of England clerics who challenged his policies]]. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited James II's daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of Orange]] to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James II's Catholic son]]) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.242\u2013245</ref>\n\nJames's overthrow, known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439\u2013440</ref> Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.\n\n===After the 1707 Acts of Union===\n[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|right|England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707.]]\n{{See also|List of British monarchs}}\nAfter Anne's accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the [[Act of Security 1704]], threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705]], threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the [[Acts of Union 1707]], under which England and Scotland were united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447\u2013448</ref>\n\nIn 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia's son, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[Elector of Hanover]], who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460\u2013469</ref> Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who is often considered the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], although the title was not then in use.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml|title=Sir Robert Walpole|accessdate=14 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The next monarch, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, [[George III]], Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the [[United States|United States of America]], but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Ashley, pp.677\u2013680</ref>\n\n[[File:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|right|thumb|The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III.]]\nFrom 1811 to 1820, George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be [[porphyria]], an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], ruled in his stead as [[Regent of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. During [[Regency era|the Regency]] and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], and appointed a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the [[Reform Act 1832]], which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530\u2013550</ref>\n\nThe final transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]] was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. As a woman, Victoria could not rule [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The [[Victorian era]] was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of [[British Raj|British rule over India]], Victoria was declared [[Empress of India]] in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican movement]], due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|her husband]] in 1861.<ref>Fraser, pp.305\u2013306</ref>\n\nVictoria's son, [[Edward VII]], became the first monarch of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, [[George V]], changed \"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\" to \"[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]\" in response to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the [[World War I|First World War]]. George V's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, in 1922.<ref>Fraser, pp.314\u2013333</ref>\n\n===Shared monarchy===\n[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|Map of the British Empire in 1921]]\n[[File:Commonwealth realm map.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#000080|Commonwealth realms}}{{Legend|#5961e6|Overseas territories of Commonwealth realms}}]]\nDuring the twentieth century, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] evolved from the [[British Empire]]. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown Colonies]] were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|accessdate=20 April 2008|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Government of Nova Scotia}}</ref> which has been likened to \"a treaty among the Commonwealth countries\".<ref>Justice Rouleau in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O'Donohue v.

The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, [[monarch of Canada]], [[monarch of Australia]], and so forth. The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a [[personal union]].<ref>Zines, Leslie (2008).

A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Coronation/Coronation.aspx|title=Coronation|accessdate=14 May 2009|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>\n\nWhen an individual ascends to the throne, it is expected they will reign until death.

An annual Property Services [[grant-in-aid]] paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel.

The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.\n\nThe monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and  [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.\n\nThe British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Although the monarch is shared, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the monarch has a different, specific, and official national [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|title and style]] for each realm.\n\n==Constitutional role==\nIn the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], the monarch (otherwise referred to as the [[sovereign]] or \"His/Her [[Majesty]]\", abbreviated H.M.) is the [[head of state]].

The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the monarch, either by [[statute]] or by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], to [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]] or officers of [[the Crown]], or other [[public body|public bodies]], exclusive of the monarch personally. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments,<ref>Crown Appointments Act 1661 c.6</ref> even if personally performed by the monarch, such as the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]], depend upon decisions made elsewhere:\n* Legislative power is exercised by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], by and with the advice and consent of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n* Executive power is exercised by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]], which comprises [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]], primarily the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], which is technically a committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

This role has been recognised since the 19th century. The constitutional writer [[Walter Bagehot]] identified the monarchy in 1867 as the \"dignified part\" rather than the \"efficient part\" of government.<ref>Bagehot, p. 9.</ref>\n\n[[File:English Bill of Rights of 1689.jpg|left|thumb|The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] curtailed the monarch's governmental power.]]\n\n===Appointment of the prime minister===\nWhenever necessary, the monarch is responsible for appointing a new prime minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other [[Minister of the Crown]], and thereby constitutes and controls the government). In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in private audience, and after \"[[kissing hands]]\" that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument.<ref>Brazier, p. 312.</ref>\n\nIn a [[hung parliament]] where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party.<ref>Waldron, pp.59\u201360</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|title=Queen and Prime Minister|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|archive-date=14 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] when [[Harold Wilson]] was appointed Prime Minister after [[Edward Heath]] resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]], when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.\n\n===Dissolution of Parliament===\nIn 1950 the King's [[Private Secretary]] [[Sir Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan \"Tommy\" Lascelles]], writing pseudonymously to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the [[Lascelles Principles]], if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|resulting general election]] gave Wilson a small majority.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/results.htm|title=Results and analysis: General election, 10 October 1974|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Political Science Resources}}</ref> The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice the prime minister's term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation.

The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, exercising prerogative only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the prime minister or [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref name=parl>{{citation|author1=Durkin, Mary |author2=Gay, Oonagh |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf|title=The Royal Prerogative|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=21 December 2005|publisher=House of Commons Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625170825/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}</ref> In practice, prerogative powers are exercised only on the prime minister's advice \u2013 the prime minister, and not the sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day > Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: \"the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;... three rights \u2013 the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\"<ref>Bagehot, p.75</ref>\n\nAlthough the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, \"The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers\", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.<ref name=PASC>{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.<ref name=PASC/>\n\nIt is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which the sovereign reads the [[Speech from the throne]] in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |title=About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament |accessdate=27 April 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119091636/http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=19 November 2002 }}</ref> Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm|title=A Guide to Prorogation|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=7 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], but can be held sooner if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election.\n\nBefore a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, the [[royal assent]] (the monarch's approval) is required.<ref>Crabbe, p.17</ref> In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82104.stm|title=Royal Assent|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=24 January 2006|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe monarch has a similar relationship with the [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]].

For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the \"prerogative of mercy\", which is used to [[pardon]] convicted offenders or reduce sentences.<ref name=parl/><ref name=PASC/>\n\nThe monarch is the \"[[fount of honour]]\", the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom.

[[Alfred the Great]] secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western [[Mercia]], and assumed the title \"King of the English\".<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12\u201313 and 31</ref> His grandson [[\u00c6thelstan]] was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13\u201317</ref> The [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the [[Feudalism|Feudal System]] continued to develop.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102\u2013127</ref>\n\nWilliam was succeeded by two of his sons: [[William II of England|William II]], then [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]], laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]]. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as [[the Anarchy]]. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin king of England]] and the first monarch of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] as Henry II in 1154.<ref>Fraser, pp.30\u201346</ref>\n\nThe reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs [[Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the [[Angevin Empire]]. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the [[Crusades]]. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.\n\nJohn's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing [[Magna Carta]] ([[Latin]] for \"Great Charter\") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the [[First Barons' War]]. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Fraser, pp.54\u201374</ref> Later in Henry's reign, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the [[Second Barons' War]]. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265.<ref>Fraser, pp.77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe next monarch, [[Edward Longshanks]], was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]]. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, [[Edward II]], who also faced conflict with the nobility.<ref>Fraser, pp.79\u201393</ref> In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of [[Ordinances of 1311|baronial \"ordainers\"]]; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322.<ref>Ashley, pp.595\u2013597</ref> Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. His 14-year-old son became [[Edward III]]. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.\n\nHis campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson [[Richard II]]. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]] seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.<ref>Fraser, pp.96\u2013115</ref>\n\nHenry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]]; hence, his dynasty was known as the [[House of Lancaster]]. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.<ref>Fraser, pp.118\u2013130</ref>\n\nThe unpopularity of Henry VI's counsellors and his belligerent consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, [[Edward IV]], led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The [[Wars of the Roses]], nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son [[Edward V]] and brother [[Richard III]]. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].<ref>Fraser, pp.133\u2013165</ref>\n\nNow King Henry VII, he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168\u2013176</ref> The reign of the second Tudor king, [[Henry VIII]], was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the [[Pope]] led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the [[Church of England]] (the Anglican Church).<ref>Fraser, pp.179\u2013189</ref>\n\nWales \u2013 which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion \u2013 was annexed to England under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]].<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309</ref> Henry VIII's son and successor, the young [[Edward VI]], continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating [[Lady Jane Grey]] as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister [[Elizabeth I]]. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.<ref>Ashley, pp.636\u2013647 and Fraser, pp.190\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Scottish monarchy===\n{{See also|List of Scottish monarchs}}\nIn Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the [[Picts]] in the north east, the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in the south, including the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and the [[Gaels]] or [[Scoti|Scotti]] (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the west. [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] to the Scots).<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1\u201312, 35</ref> The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.\n\nEarly Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of [[tanistry]] was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the [[House of Alpin]]. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle.<ref>Weir, pp.164\u2013177</ref> In 1005, [[Malcolm II]] ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, [[Duncan I]], instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]], who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson [[Lulach]], Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.<ref>Ashley, pp.390\u2013395</ref>\n\nWith a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. David was succeeded by his grandsons [[Malcolm IV]], and then by [[William the Lion]], the longest-reigning King of Scots before the [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>Ashley, pp.400\u2013407 and Weir, pp.185\u2013198</ref> William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.170</ref> William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]]. Alexander II, as well as his successor [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], attempted to take over the [[Western Isles]], which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing [[Treaty of Perth]] recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.<ref>Ashley, pp.407\u2013409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196</ref>\n\nAlexander III's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]]. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|13 rival claimants to the throne]]. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced [[John Balliol]] to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Scotland had no monarch, until [[Robert the Bruce]] declared himself king in 1306.<ref>Ashley, pp.409\u2013412</ref>\n\nRobert's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, [[Edward Balliol]], the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.<ref>Ashley, pp.549\u2013552</ref>\n\nDavid II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] of the [[House of Stuart]]. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, [[regent]]s had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son [[James I of Scotland|James I]], had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. [[James II of Scotland|James II]] continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: [[James IV]].<ref>Ashley, pp.552\u2013565</ref>\n\nIn 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden Field]]; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, [[James V]], was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]]. Once again, a regency was established.\n\nMary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as [[John Knox]], a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son [[James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Ashley, pp.567\u2013575</ref>\n\n===Personal union and republican phase===\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.]]\nElizabeth I's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch [[James VI]], who was the great-grandson of [[Henry VIII]]'s older sister and hence Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\". Although England and Scotland were in [[personal union]] under one monarch \u2013 James I became the first monarch to style himself \"King of Great Britain\" in 1604<ref>Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604</ref> \u2013 they remained two separate kingdoms. James I's successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and the English [[Puritans]]). His attempt to enforce [[Anglicanism]] led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the \"[[Bishops' Wars]]\") and ignited the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the [[English Civil War]] began.<ref>Fraser, pp.214\u2013231</ref>\n\nThe Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]]. In 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]], the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself [[Lord Protector]] (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393\u2013400</ref> The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] and Charles II returned to Britain.<ref>Fraser, p.232</ref>\n\nCharles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] arose; the \"Petitioners\", who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the \"Abhorrers\", who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison [[Seven Bishops|Church of England clerics who challenged his policies]]. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited James II's daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of Orange]] to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James II's Catholic son]]) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.242\u2013245</ref>\n\nJames's overthrow, known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439\u2013440</ref> Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.\n\n===After the 1707 Acts of Union===\n[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|right|England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707.]]\n{{See also|List of British monarchs}}\nAfter Anne's accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the [[Act of Security 1704]], threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705]], threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the [[Acts of Union 1707]], under which England and Scotland were united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447\u2013448</ref>\n\nIn 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia's son, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[Elector of Hanover]], who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460\u2013469</ref> Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who is often considered the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], although the title was not then in use.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml|title=Sir Robert Walpole|accessdate=14 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The next monarch, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, [[George III]], Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the [[United States|United States of America]], but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Ashley, pp.677\u2013680</ref>\n\n[[File:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|right|thumb|The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III.]]\nFrom 1811 to 1820, George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be [[porphyria]], an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], ruled in his stead as [[Regent of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. During [[Regency era|the Regency]] and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], and appointed a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the [[Reform Act 1832]], which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530\u2013550</ref>\n\nThe final transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]] was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. As a woman, Victoria could not rule [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The [[Victorian era]] was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of [[British Raj|British rule over India]], Victoria was declared [[Empress of India]] in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican movement]], due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|her husband]] in 1861.<ref>Fraser, pp.305\u2013306</ref>\n\nVictoria's son, [[Edward VII]], became the first monarch of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, [[George V]], changed \"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\" to \"[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]\" in response to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the [[World War I|First World War]]. George V's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, in 1922.<ref>Fraser, pp.314\u2013333</ref>\n\n===Shared monarchy===\n[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|Map of the British Empire in 1921]]\n[[File:Commonwealth realm map.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#000080|Commonwealth realms}}{{Legend|#5961e6|Overseas territories of Commonwealth realms}}]]\nDuring the twentieth century, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] evolved from the [[British Empire]]. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown Colonies]] were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|accessdate=20 April 2008|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Government of Nova Scotia}}</ref> which has been likened to \"a treaty among the Commonwealth countries\".<ref>Justice Rouleau in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O'Donohue v. Canada], 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)</ref>\n\nThe monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it is often still referred to as \"British\" for legal and historical reasons and for convenience. The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, [[monarch of Canada]], [[monarch of Australia]], and so forth. The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a [[personal union]].<ref>Zines, Leslie (2008).

Succession is governed by statutes such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. The rules of succession may only be changed by an [[Act of Parliament]]; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630\u20131714), a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]].\n\nUpon the death of a sovereign, their heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase \"[[The king is dead, long live the king!]]\"), and the accession of the new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an [[Accession Council]] that meets at [[St James's Palace]].<ref name=accessioncouncil>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |title=Accession |accessdate=14 May 2009 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531055207/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |archivedate=31 May 2015 }}</ref> Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the [[Accession Declaration]] as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Coronation/Coronation.aspx|title=Coronation|accessdate=14 May 2009|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>\n\nWhen an individual ascends to the throne, it is expected they will reign until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of [[Edward VIII]], had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was [[James VII and II]], who fled into exile in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\n===Restrictions by gender and religion===\n{{See also|Succession to the Crown Act 2013}}\nSuccession was largely governed by [[primogeniture|male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same gender. The British prime minister, [[David Cameron]], announced at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] that all 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting, 28 October 2011.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls Equal in British throne succession|accessdate=28 October 2011|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic \u2013 a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701.

When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.<ref name=regact53>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1121879|title=Regency Act 1953|accessdate=9 October 2008|publisher=Ministry of Justice}}</ref> Since reaching adulthood (in November 1966), [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], has been first in line for the regency.\n\nDuring a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession.

An annual Property Services [[grant-in-aid]] paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment.

([[Latin]]: \"No-one provokes me with impunity\"); the supporters are the unicorn and lion, who support both the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[lance]]s, from which fly the flags of [[flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[flag of England|England]].\n\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (Both Realms).svg|thumb|center|upright=2.75|The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|coat of arms]] of [[Elizabeth II]] in the United Kingdom.

George also appeared as a guest on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1979.\n\n===''CBS Morning News''===\n{{Main|The Early Show#The 1980s}}\nIn 1985, CBS settled on Phyllis George to serve as a permanent anchor for its morning news program. George was given a three-year contract following a two-week trial run.<ref>{{cite news| title=Phyllis George enjoys first day as co-anchor| date=January 15, 1985| newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]| page=3}}</ref>  As co-anchor, she interviewed newsmakers including then\u2013First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]].\n\nA low point of her eight month stint on The CBS Morning News happened when George embarrassed herself during a May 1985 interview with George Dotson and Cathleen Webb. Dotson had just been freed after six years in prison on a rape charge by Webb. Webb ended up recanting her story so Doton was set free.  Both appeared on the CBS program as part of, what George later told Tom Shales of the Washington Post, a Webb-Dotson press tour \"charade.\" Both were or had appeared on NBC News and ABC News as well as other media outlets. As the segment began to wrap, George first suggested the two shake hands. After a brief hesitation from them and no handshake the news actress then proposed they hug it out. Only a brief moment of awkwardness followed but no hug. The invitation to embrace was deemed highly inappropriate prompting a few phone calls from irate CBS viewers. George was also criticized in the press. <[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/05/16/invitation-to-a-hug-phyllis-georges-gaffe-with-dotson-38/abd90ef2-c53a-4785-947a-56709e47d0b5/  \"Invitation to a Hug Phyllis George's Gaffe With Dotson & Webb\" by Tom Shales May 16, 1985]> \n\nAccording to news reports at the time, George had been brought in to boost the ratings of the perennial 3rd placed ranked program. CBS News staffers were mystified as to why someone with little to no journalism experience was picked over a more qualified candidate from the CBS News roster of reporters and anchors. George had been a talent for the sports division but had not worked in news. These days that doesn't appear to be a problem as a lot of sports personalities and entertainment celebrities regularly host or have hosted network news programs. But the experiment didn't work and George would be out the door just a few months later. Maria Shriver, then a CBS News employee, took her place as part of another revamp of the program. <[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/arts/phyllis-george-quits-cbs-morning-news.html \"PHYLLIS GEORGE QUITS 'CBS MORNING NEWS\" By Sally Bedell Smith Aug. 31, 1985]>\n\n===Business interests===\n[[File:Phyllis_George.jpg|thumb|left|George in 2000]]\nGeorge has founded two companies in her business career, the first of which was \"Chicken by George\"<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=COMPANY NEWS; Chicken by George |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/business/company-news-chicken-by-george.html |url-status=live |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Associated Press |date=1988-08-19 |accessdate=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Trott |first=William C. |date=1987-08-13 |title=CHICKEN BY GEORGE: There she is, Phyllis George, chicken... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/08/13/CHICKEN-BY-GEORGE-There-she-is-Phyllis-George-chicken/4490555825600/ |url-status=live |work=[[United Press International]] |location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]] |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2019-11-01}}</ref> chicken fillets.

George also appeared as a guest on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1979.\n\n===''CBS Morning News''===\n{{Main|The Early Show#The 1980s}}\nIn 1985, CBS settled on Phyllis George to serve as a permanent anchor for its morning news program. George was given a three-year contract following a two-week trial run.<ref>{{cite news| title=Phyllis George enjoys first day as co-anchor| date=January 15, 1985| newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]| page=3}}</ref>  As co-anchor, she interviewed newsmakers including then\u2013First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]].\n\nA low point of her eight month stint on the The CBS Morning News happened when George embarrassed herself during a May 1985 interview with George Dotson and Cathleen Webb. Dotson had just been freed after six years in prison on a rape charge by Webb. Webb ended up recanting her story so Doton was set free.  Both appeared on the CBS program as part of, what George later told Tom Shales of the Washington Post, a Webb-Dotson press tour \"charade.\" Both were or had appeared on NBC News and ABC News as well as other media outlets. As the segment began to wrap, George first suggested the two shake hands. After a brief hesitation from them and no handshake the news actress then proposed they hug it out. Only a brief moment of awkwardness followed but no hug. The invitation to embrace was deemed highly inappropriate prompting a few phone calls from irate CBS viewers. George was also criticized in the press. <[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/05/16/invitation-to-a-hug-phyllis-georges-gaffe-with-dotson-38/abd90ef2-c53a-4785-947a-56709e47d0b5/  \"Invitation to a Hug Phyllis George's Gaffe With Dotson & Webb\" by Tom Shales May 16, 1985]> \n\nAccording to news reports at the time, George had been brought in to boost the ratings of the perennial 3rd placed ranked program. CBS News staffers were mystified as to why someone with little to no journalism experience was picked over a more qualified candidate from the CBS News roster of reporters and anchors. George had been a talent for the sports division but had not worked in news. These days that doesn't appear to be a problem as a lot of sports personalities and entertainment celebrities regularly host or have hosted network news programs. But the experiment didn't work and George would be out the door just a few months later. Maria Shriver, then a CBS News employee, took her place as part of another revamp of the program. <[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/arts/phyllis-george-quits-cbs-morning-news.html \"PHYLLIS GEORGE QUITS 'CBS MORNING NEWS\" By Sally Bedell Smith Aug. 31, 1985]>\n\n===Business interests===\n[[File:Phyllis_George.jpg|thumb|left|George in 2000]]\nGeorge has founded two companies in her business career, the first of which was \"Chicken by George\"<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=COMPANY NEWS; Chicken by George |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/business/company-news-chicken-by-george.html |url-status=live |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Associated Press |date=1988-08-19 |accessdate=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Trott |first=William C. |date=1987-08-13 |title=CHICKEN BY GEORGE: There she is, Phyllis George, chicken... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/08/13/CHICKEN-BY-GEORGE-There-she-is-Phyllis-George-chicken/4490555825600/ |url-status=live |work=[[United Press International]] |location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]] |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2019-11-01}}</ref> chicken fillets.
