It was Founded by Lucas Fernandez Pe\u00f1a in 1923. The city's name originates from the first daughter of Lucas Fernandez Pena Elena, and Uair\u00e9n by the river that crosses the city.\n\nLocated in the middle of [[La Gran Sabana]], Santa Elena is home to many travel agencies offering tours in [[Canaima National Park]], flights over [[Angel Falls]], and hiking tours to the famous [[Monte Roraima]].\n\nThe town is notable for its influential presence of indigenous peoples; there is even a community called Manakr\u00fc (pronounced mah-nah-CREE) populated entirely by indigenous people.

Named for the famous [[Burra, South Australia|mine in Australia]], the Burra Burra Mine is located in the [[Copper Basin (Tennessee)|Copper Basin]] geological region, and extracted over 15 million tons (14 million metric tons) of copper ore during its 60 years of operation between 1899 and 1959.  The mine's remaining structures are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the Burra Burra Mine Historic District.  The site is also home to the '''[[Ducktown Basin Museum]]''', and the museum and mine are a Tennessee State Historic Site operated in partnership with the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]].\n\nThe Burra Burra Mine was one of a number of mining operations in the Copper Basin from 1850 to 1987 that produced substantial amounts of copper ore that contained sulfur. Trees were cut to smelt the ore and burn off the sulfur.

{"title_page": "Tsuki", "text_new": "{{About|the martial arts term}}\n{{infobox martial art term\n| pic = JJS Karate Kids on Training.jpg\n| piccap = A successful tsuki in [[Karate]].\n| picsize = 250px\n| kanji = \u7a81\u304d\n| hiragana = \u3064\u304d\n| revhep = tsuki\n| querer kkeos,oskslw= tuki\n}}{{Nihongo|'''Tsuki'''|\u7a81\u304d}} is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for \"thrust\", coming from the verb {{Nihongo|''tsuku''|\u7a81\u304f}}, meaning \"to thrust\". The second syllable is accented, with Japanese's [[Japanese phonology#Devoicing|unvoiced vowels]] making it pronounced almost like \"[[ski]]\" (but preceded by a \"t\" sound). In [[Japanese martial arts]] and [[Okinawan martial arts]], ''tsuki'' is used to refer to various thrusting techniques.\n\n==Tsuki in Karate==\n\n[[File:Oitsuki.jpg|right|70px|thumb|Oi-tsuki]]\n[[File:Gyakutsuki.jpg|right|70px|thumb|Gyaku-tsuki]]\n\nIn [[karate]] and its variants, the term ''tsuki'' is used as a part of a compound word for any one of a variety of thrusting techniques (usually [[Punch (combat)#Karate|punches]]). It is never used as a stand-alone term to describe a discrete technique. For example, ''gyaku seiken chudan-tsuki'', more commonly referred to as ''chudan-tsuki'' (\u6bb5\u7a81), refers to a mid-level (''chudan'') punch (''tsuki'') executed with the rear (''gyaku'') arm. Note that in a compound word, where ''tsuki'' does not come first, its pronunciation and writing changes slightly due to [[rendaku]], and it is pronounced as \"''zuki''\" (and is sometimes transliterated that way).\n\n===Performing a Choku-Tsuki (Straight Punch) in Karate===\n\nThe ''choku-tsuki'' (\u76f4\u7a81\u304d) \u2013 straight punch\u2014is a basic [[karate technique]]. It is performed by closing the hand in a fist. Target contact is made with the first two knuckles of the fore-fist, with the fist rotated slightly, both externally and downwards, so as to align the wrist directly behind the first two knuckles. For a right ''choku-tsuki'', the right fist is chambered at a preparatory position, at the hips or by the ribs, with the palm side of the fist pointed upwards. At the same time, the left arm is extended in front of the left hip. To perform the ''choku-tsuki'' technique, the right fist is thrust forward in a direct path toward the target, with the elbow directly behind the fist and tracing the fist's path. At the same time, the left fist is pulled back to a chambered position at the hip or at the rib cage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Funakoshi|first1=Gichin|title=Karate Jutsu|date=2001|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Japan|isbn=4-7700-2681-1|page=43}}</ref> The extending fist remains palm up until the last two inches of the punch, during which it rotates to face down. The elbow remains pointed down, since allowing the elbow to rotate to the side or upwards exposes it to injury from either self-inflicted [[hyperextend|hyperextension]], or from a stiff block by the opponent. Ideally, the fist contacts the target in a vertical to a 45 degree rotated position, with the rest of the fist's rotation taking place following initial contact.\n\nKarate gives special emphasis to the withdrawing hand \u2013 ''hikite'' (\u5f15\u304d\u624b) \u2013 which pulls back as the thrusting arm punches. Practitioners are advised to pay as much attention to the pullback action as to the extension of the main punch.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oyama|first1=Masatutatsu|title=Mastering Karate|date=1975|publisher=Grosset & Dunlap|location=New York|isbn=0-448-01747-4|pages=41\u201343}}</ref> Different karate styles will have slightly different pullback chambering positions, varying from as low as on top of the hip, to as high as the armpit.\n\nA straight punch executed from a front stance ([[zenkutsu-dachi]]) is called ''gyaku-tsuki'' (\u9006\u7a81\u304d, reverse punch) if the advanced leg and fist are on opposite sides, or ''oi-tsuki'' (\u8ffd\u3044\u7a81\u304d, forward punch or lunge punch) if the leg and fist are on the same side.\n\n===Tsuki Power Generation===\n\nThe mechanism of power generation in thrusting techniques varies with karate style.

In those styles, the body is typically well aligned and relaxed throughout the strike. On the other hand, Japanese karate styles, such as [[Shotokan]], emphasize the movement of the hips as the main mean for generating power: The hips twist as the withdrawing (non-punching) ''hikite'' arm is pulled back while the punching arm is pushed forward, and the karateka is taught to tense the whole body and to push down his or her rear leg as the punch makes contact.\n\n===Other Examples of Tsuki Techniques===\n\nOther examples of basic ''tsuki'' techniques in karate include the following:\n\n* ''Age-tsuki'' (\u4e0a\u3052\u7a81\u304d), [[uppercut|rising]] punch\n* ''Kagi-tsuki'' (\u9264\u7a81\u304d), [[hook (boxing)|hook]] punch\n* ''Mawashi-tsuki'' (\u56de\u3057\u7a81\u304d), roundhouse punch\n* ''Morote-tsuki'' (\u53cc\u624b\u7a81\u304d), augmented punch using both hands\n* ''Jun-tsuki (''\u9806\u7a81\u304d''), ''punch with the lead arm when stationary or moving back/away \n* ''Tate-tsuki'' (\u7acb\u3066\u7a81\u304d), vertical fist punch into the middle of the chest (short-range)\n* ''Ura-tsuki'' (\u88cf\u7a81\u304d), upside-down fist punch into solar plexus area (short-range)\n* ''Yama-tsuki'' (\u5c71\u7a81\u304d) or ''Rete-zuki'', two-level double punch (combination of ''ura-zuki'' and [[jodan]] [[oi zuki]])\n\n==Tsuki in Aikido and Aiki-jo==\nIn [[aikido|aikid\u014d]], choku-zuki (straight punch, as described above) is a basic thrusting attack from which throwing and pinning skills are taught. However, because in most [[aikido|aikid\u014d]] schools the straight punch is the predominant punch from which defensive techniques are taught, there is little need to differentiate it from any other punch. Thus, it is shortened and simply called tsuki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainlinebudo.com/?p=464|title=Attacks?

With the student standing in [[hidari katate-gamae]], the weapon is lifted to the right hand, which slides to the bottom end of the weapon. The student shuffle steps forward (suri-ashi) and the right hand pushes the weapon for the strike, allowing it to slide in the left hand, and coming to rest with the left hand gripping the j\u014d one third the distance from the bottom end.

The second syllable is accented, with Japanese's [[Japanese phonology#Devoicing|unvoiced vowels]] making it pronounced almost like \"[[ski]]\" (but preceded by a \"t\" sound). In [[Japanese martial arts]] and [[Okinawan martial arts]], ''tsuki'' is used to refer to various thrusting techniques.\n\n==Tsuki in Karate==\n\n[[File:Oitsuki.jpg|right|70px|thumb|Oi-tsuki]]\n[[File:Gyakutsuki.jpg|right|70px|thumb|Gyaku-tsuki]]\n\nIn [[karate]] and its variants, the term ''tsuki'' is used as a part of a compound word for any one of a variety of thrusting techniques (usually [[Punch (combat)#Karate|punches]]). It is never used as a stand-alone term to describe a discrete technique. For example, ''gyaku seiken chudan-tsuki'', more commonly referred to as ''chudan-tsuki'' (\u6bb5\u7a81), refers to a mid-level (''chudan'') punch (''tsuki'') executed with the rear (''gyaku'') arm. Note that in a compound word, where ''tsuki'' does not come first, its pronunciation and writing changes slightly due to [[rendaku]], and it is pronounced as \"''zuki''\" (and is sometimes transliterated that way).\n\n===Performing a Choku-Tsuki (Straight Punch) in Karate===\n\nThe ''choku-tsuki'' (\u76f4\u7a81\u304d) -- straight punch\u2014is a basic [[karate technique]]. It is performed by closing the hand in a fist. Target contact is made with the first two knuckles of the fore-fist, with the fist rotated slightly, both externally and downwards, so as to align the wrist directly behind the first two knuckles. For a right ''choku-tsuki'', the right fist is chambered at a preparatory position, at the hips or by the ribs, with the palm side of the fist pointed upwards. At the same time, the left arm is extended in front of the left hip. To perform the ''choku-tsuki'' technique, the right fist is thrust forward in a direct path toward the target, with the elbow directly behind the fist and tracing the fist's path. At the same time, the left fist is pulled back to a chambered position at the hip or at the rib cage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Funakoshi|first1=Gichin|title=Karate Jutsu|date=2001|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Japan|isbn=4-7700-2681-1|page=43}}</ref> The extending fist remains palm up until the last two inches of the punch, during which it rotates to face down. The elbow remains pointed down, since allowing the elbow to rotate to the side or upwards exposes it to injury from either self-inflicted [[hyperextend|hyperextension]], or from a stiff block by the opponent. Ideally, the fist contacts the target in a vertical to a 45 degree rotated position, with the rest of the fist's rotation taking place following initial contact.\n\nKarate gives special emphasis to the withdrawing hand -- ''hikite'' (\u5f15\u304d\u624b) -- which pulls back as the thrusting arm punches. Practitioners are advised to pay as much attention to the pullback action as to the extension of the main punch.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oyama|first1=Masatutatsu|title=Mastering Karate|date=1975|publisher=Grosset & Dunlap|location=New York|isbn=0-448-01747-4|pages=41\u201343}}</ref> Different karate styles will have slightly different pullback chambering positions, varying from as low as on top of the hip, to as high as the armpit.\n\nA straight punch executed from a front stance ([[zenkutsu-dachi]]) is called ''gyaku-tsuki'' (\u9006\u7a81\u304d, reverse punch) if the advanced leg and fist are on opposite sides, or ''oi-tsuki'' (\u8ffd\u3044\u7a81\u304d, forward punch or lunge punch) if the leg and fist are on the same side.\n\n===Tsuki Power Generation===\n\nThe mechanism of power generation in thrusting techniques varies with karate style. Various karate styles and, in particular, Okinawan karate, emphasize the use of the entire body to generate the power that is delivered through the punch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Power Generation in Martial Arts and Karate|url=http://www.fullpotentialma.com/power-generation-martial-arts-axis-spine-center-gamaku/|publisher=Full Potential Martial Arts, San Diego}}</ref> This can include sequencing the activation of muscles, from lower body to upper body, to create a \"wave\" of power.
