It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.\n\nThe development of a new [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'']] film began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the [[The Invisible Man|novel's]] plot, and the combination of scares with \"a smart narrative about how women can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\".<ref name=WrapProj/> The film also became a commercial success, grossing $125.8&nbsp;million worldwide against a $7&nbsp;million budget and it is currently the [[2020 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2020]]. However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available for [[Video on demand|digital rental]] just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]] ([[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]]), Cecilia Kass ([[Elisabeth Moss]])\u00a0drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily ([[Harriet Dyer]]). After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend, Detective James Lanier ([[Aldis Hodge]]), and his teenage daughter Sydney ([[Storm Reid]]). Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5 million in his will handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom ([[Michael Dorman]]). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom\u00a0and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle before escaping to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disputes this, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight however, she silently taunts Adrian; having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved that she's finally free from Adrian, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n* Benedict Hardie as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.

It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.\n\nThe development of a new [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'']] film began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the [[The Invisible Man|novel's]] plot, and the combination of scares with \"a smart narrative about how women can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\".<ref name=WrapProj/> The film also became a commercial success, grossing $125.8&nbsp;million worldwide against a $7&nbsp;million budget and it is currently the [[2020 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2020]]. However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available for [[Video on demand|digital rental]] just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]] ([[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]]), Cecilia Kass ([[Elisabeth Moss]])\u00a0drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily ([[Harriet Dyer]]). After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend, Detective James Lanier ([[Aldis Hodge]]), and his teenage daughter Sydney ([[Storm Reid]]). Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5 million in his will handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom ([[Michael Dorman]]). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom\u00a0and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle before escaping to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disputes this, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight however, she silently taunts Adrian; having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved that she's finally free from Adrian, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n* Benedict Hardie as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.
