These colors are not a result of [[pigmentation]], but are an example of [[iridescence]] through [[structural coloration]]. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=P.

The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings.<ref name=Siddique_Morpho_coloration>{{cite journal |last1=Siddique |first1=R.

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. ''Morpho''s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.\n*The genus ''Morpho'' is palatable, but some species (such as ''[[Morpho amathonte|M. amathonte]]'') are very strong fliers; birds\u2014even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing\u2014find it very hard to catch them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Allen M. |year=1971 |title=Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators |journal=Oecologia |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013222 |doi=10.1007/bf00345212|pmid=28311247 }}</ref> The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]],<ref name=\"pinheiro\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinheiro |first1=Carlos E.

Papered specimens are sold with the abdomen removed to prevent its oily contents from staining the wings.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]].

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. ''Morpho''s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.\n*The genus ''Morpho'' is palatable, but some species (such as ''[[Morpho amathonte|M. amathonte]]'') are very strong fliers; birds\u2014even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing\u2014find it very hard to catch them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Allen M. |year=1971 |title=Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators |journal=Oecologia |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013222 |doi=10.1007/bf00345212|pmid=28311247 }}</ref> The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]],<ref name=\"pinheiro\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinheiro |first1=Carlos E.

The caterpillars have reddish-brown bodies with bright lime-green or yellow patches on their backs. Its hairs are irritating to human skin, and when disturbed it secretes a fluid that smells like rancid butter from eversible glands on the thorax. The strong odor is a defense against predators. They feed on a variety of plants. The caterpillar molts five times before entering the [[pupa]]l stage. The bulbous chrysalis is pale green or jade green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched.<ref>Nussbaum, Greg.

The iridescent wings are used in the manufacture of [[jewelry]] and as inlay in [[woodworking]]. Papered specimens are sold with the abdomen removed to prevent its oily contents from staining the wings. Significant quantities of live specimens are exported as pupae from several Neotropical countries for exhibition in butterfly houses. Unfortunately, due to their irregular flight pattern and size, their wings are frequently damaged when in captivity.\n\n== Host plants ==\n''Morpho'' larvae, variously according to species and region, feed on [[Leguminosae]], [[Gramineae]], [[Canellaceae]], [[Guttiferae]], [[Erythroxylaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Moraceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Sapindaceae]], [[Rhamnaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Musaceae]], [[Palmae]], [[Menispermaceae]], [[Tiliaceae]], [[Bignoniaceae]], and [[Menispermaceae]].\n\nAccording to Penz and DeVries<ref name=\"Penz, C.M. & P.J.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]]. More famous is [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], who was not wealthy.\n\nThe people along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in [[Brazil]] once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (''[[Morpho menelaus|M. menelaus]]'') by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured.

Over the first half of the 20th century, two main proposals were made to explain this phenomenon:\n\n# There were (at least) two different types of neurotransmitters released from sympathetic nerve terminals, or\n# There were (at least) two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter.\n\nThe first hypothesis was championed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cannon WB, Rosenbluth A | date= 31 May 1933| title = Studies On Conditions Of Activity In Endocrine Organs XXVI: Sympathin E and Sympathin I | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume= 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 557\u2013574 | doi= 10.1152/ajplegacy.1933.104.3.557}}</ref> who interpreted many experiments to then propose that there were two neurotransmitter substances, which they called sympathin E (for 'excitation') and sympathin I (for 'inhibition').\n\nThe second hypothesis found support from 1906 to 1913, when [[Henry Hallett Dale]] explored the effects of adrenaline (which he called adrenine at the time), injected into animals, on blood pressure.  Usually, adrenaline would increase the blood pressure of these animals. Although, if the animal had been exposed to [[ergot]]oxine, the blood pressure decreased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On some physiological actions of ergot | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 163\u2013206 | date = May 1906 | pmid = 16992821 | doi =  10.1113/jphysiol.1906.sp001148 | pmc=1465771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On the action of ergotoxine; with special reference to the existence of sympathetic vasodilators | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 291\u2013300 | date = Jun 1913 | pmid = 16993202 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1913.sp001592 | pmc=1420444}}</ref> He proposed that the ergotoxine caused \"selective paralysis of motor myoneural junctions\" (i.e. those tending to increase the blood pressure) hence revealing that under normal conditions that there was a \"mixed response\", including a mechanism that would relax smooth muscle and cause a fall in blood pressure. This \"mixed response\", with the same compound causing either contraction or relaxation, was conceived of as the response of different types of junctions to the same compound.\n\nThis line of experiments were developed by several groups, including DT Marsh and colleagues,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DT, Pelletier MH, Rose CA | title = The comparative pharmacology of the N-alkyl-arterenols | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 108\u201320 | date = Feb 1948 | pmid = 18903395 }}</ref> who in February 1948 showed that a series of compounds structurally related to adrenaline could also show either contracting or relaxing effects, depending on whether or not other toxins were present. This again supported the argument that the muscles had two different mechanisms by which they could respond to the same compound. In June of that year, [[Raymond Ahlquist]], Professor of Pharmacology at Medical College of Georgia, published a paper concerning adrenergic nervous transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist RP | title = A study of the adrenotropic receptors | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 586\u2013600 | date = Jun 1948 | pmid = 18882199 | doi =  10.1152/ajplegacy.1948.153.3.586| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24c73eb8823d260c3c8d19467e62fc81215b384d }}</ref> In it, he explicitly named the different responses as due to what he called \u03b1 receptors and \u03b2 receptors, and that the only sympathetic transmitter was adrenaline. While the latter conclusion was subsequently shown to be incorrect (it is now known to be noradrenaline), his receptor nomenclature and concept of ''two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter'', remains.  In 1954, he was able to incorporate his findings in a textbook, ''Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Drill|first=Victor Alexander|name-list-format=vanc|date=1954|title=Pharmacology in medicine: a collaborative textbook|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyinme00dril|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=|isbn=}}</ref> and thereby promulgate the  role played by \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor sites in the adrenaline/noradrenaline cellular mechanism. These concepts would revolutionise advances in pharmacotherapeutic research, allowing the selective design of specific molecules to target medical ailments rather than rely upon traditional research into the efficacy of pre-existing herbal medicines.\n\n==Categories==\n[[Image:Adrenoceptor-Signal transduktion.PNG|thumb|400px|The mechanism of adrenoreceptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are [[receptor ligands]] to either [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] or \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] couples to [[Gq alpha subunit|G<sub>q</sub>]], which results in increased intracellular [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and subsequent [[smooth muscle]] contraction. [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]], on the other hand, couples to [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. \u03b2 receptors couple to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]], and increases intracellular [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity, resulting in e.g. [[heart muscle]] contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and [[glycogenolysis]].|alt=]]\nThere are two main groups of adrenoreceptors, \u03b1 and \u03b2, with 9 subtypes in total:\n* \u03b1 are divided to [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] (a [[G protein|G<sub>q</sub>]] coupled receptor) and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] (a G<sub>i</sub> coupled receptor)<ref name=\":1\" />\n**\u03b1<sub>1</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1D</sub>{{efn|name=d}}\n**\u03b1<sub>2</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>2A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>2B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>2C</sub>\n* \u03b2 are divided to [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>3</sub>]]. All 3 are coupled to [[Gs protein|G<sub>s</sub> proteins]], but \u03b2<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2<sub>3</sub> also couple to G<sub>i</sub><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nG<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> are linked to [[adenylyl cyclase]]. [[Agonist]] binding thus causes a rise in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger(Gi inhibits the production of cAMP)  [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]]. Downstream effectors of cAMP include [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]] (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding.\n\n===Roles in circulation===\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) reacts with both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors, causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Although \u03b1 receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by \u03b2-adrenoreceptors because there are more peripheral \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors than \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. However, the opposite is true in the coronary arteries, where \u03b2<sub>2</sub> response is greater than that of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, resulting in overall dilation with increased sympathetic stimulation. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), \u03b2-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor than the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Subtypes===\nSmooth muscle behavior is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below.  One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle.  Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased contractility and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" |

The SNS is responsible for the [[fight-or-flight response]], which is triggered by experiences such as [[exercise]] or [[fear]]-causing situations. This response [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], increases heart rate, mobilizes energy, and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to [[skeletal muscle]].

Over the first half of the 20th century, two main proposals were made to explain this phenomenon:\n\n# There were (at least) two different types of neurotransmitters released from sympathetic nerve terminals, or\n# There were (at least) two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter.\n\nThe first hypothesis was championed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cannon WB, Rosenbluth A | date= 31 May 1933| title = Studies On Conditions Of Activity In Endocrine Organs XXVI: Sympathin E and Sympathin I | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume= 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 557\u2013574 | doi= 10.1152/ajplegacy.1933.104.3.557}}</ref> who interpreted many experiments to then propose that there were two neurotransmitter substances, which they called sympathin E (for 'excitation') and sympathin I (for 'inhibition').\n\nThe second hypothesis found support from 1906 to 1913, when [[Henry Hallett Dale]] explored the effects of adrenaline (which he called adrenine at the time), injected into animals, on blood pressure.  Usually, adrenaline would increase the blood pressure of these animals. Although, if the animal had been exposed to [[ergot]]oxine, the blood pressure decreased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On some physiological actions of ergot | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 163\u2013206 | date = May 1906 | pmid = 16992821 | doi =  10.1113/jphysiol.1906.sp001148 | pmc=1465771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On the action of ergotoxine; with special reference to the existence of sympathetic vasodilators | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 291\u2013300 | date = Jun 1913 | pmid = 16993202 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1913.sp001592 | pmc=1420444}}</ref> He proposed that the ergotoxine caused \"selective paralysis of motor myoneural junctions\" (i.e. those tending to increase the blood pressure) hence revealing that under normal conditions that there was a \"mixed response\", including a mechanism that would relax smooth muscle and cause a fall in blood pressure. This \"mixed response\", with the same compound causing either contraction or relaxation, was conceived of as the response of different types of junctions to the same compound.\n\nThis line of experiments were developed by several groups, including DT Marsh and colleagues,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DT, Pelletier MH, Rose CA | title = The comparative pharmacology of the N-alkyl-arterenols | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 108\u201320 | date = Feb 1948 | pmid = 18903395 }}</ref> who in February 1948 showed that a series of compounds structurally related to adrenaline could also show either contracting or relaxing effects, depending on whether or not other toxins were present. This again supported the argument that the muscles had two different mechanisms by which they could respond to the same compound. In June of that year, [[Raymond Ahlquist]], Professor of Pharmacology at Medical College of Georgia, published a paper concerning adrenergic nervous transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist RP | title = A study of the adrenotropic receptors | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 586\u2013600 | date = Jun 1948 | pmid = 18882199 | doi =  10.1152/ajplegacy.1948.153.3.586| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24c73eb8823d260c3c8d19467e62fc81215b384d }}</ref> In it, he explicitly named the different responses as due to what he called \u03b1 receptors and \u03b2 receptors, and that the only sympathetic transmitter was adrenaline. While the latter conclusion was subsequently shown to be incorrect (it is now known to be noradrenaline), his receptor nomenclature and concept of ''two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter'', remains.  In 1954, he was able to incorporate his findings in a textbook, ''Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Drill|first=Victor Alexander|name-list-format=vanc|date=1954|title=Pharmacology in medicine: a collaborative textbook|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyinme00dril|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=|isbn=}}</ref> and thereby promulgate the  role played by \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor sites in the adrenaline/noradrenaline cellular mechanism. These concepts would revolutionise advances in pharmacotherapeutic research, allowing the selective design of specific molecules to target medical ailments rather than rely upon traditional research into the efficacy of pre-existing herbal medicines.\n\n==Categories==\n[[Image:Adrenoceptor-Signal transduktion.PNG|thumb|400px|The mechanism of adrenoreceptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are [[receptor ligands]] to either [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] or \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] couples to [[Gq alpha subunit|G<sub>q</sub>]], which results in increased intracellular [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and subsequent [[smooth muscle]] contraction. [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]], on the other hand, couples to [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. \u03b2 receptors couple to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]], and increases intracellular [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity, resulting in e.g. [[heart muscle]] contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and [[glycogenolysis]].|alt=]]\nThere are two main groups of adrenoreceptors, \u03b1 and \u03b2, with 9 subtypes in total:\n* \u03b1 are divided to [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] (a [[G protein|G<sub>q</sub>]] coupled receptor) and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] (a G<sub>i</sub> coupled receptor)<ref name=\":1\" />\n**\u03b1<sub>1</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1D</sub>{{efn|name=d}}\n**\u03b1<sub>2</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>2A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>2B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>2C</sub>\n* \u03b2 are divided to [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>3</sub>]].

[[Agonist]] binding thus causes a rise in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger(Gi inhibits the production of cAMP)  [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]]. Downstream effectors of cAMP include [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]] (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding.\n\n===Roles in circulation===\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) reacts with both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors, causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Although \u03b1 receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by \u03b2-adrenoreceptors because there are more peripheral \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors than \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. However, the opposite is true in the coronary arteries, where \u03b2<sub>2</sub> response is greater than that of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, resulting in overall dilation with increased sympathetic stimulation. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), \u03b2-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor than the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Subtypes===\nSmooth muscle behavior is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below.  One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle.  Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased contractility and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" |

As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923, and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had [[speech therapy]] for a [[stammer]], which he never fully overcame.\n\nGeorge's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, Edward was forced to choose between the crown and marriage to divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. With the [[abdication of Edward]] to marry Simpson, George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].\n\nIn September 1939, the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth\u2014except Ireland\u2014declared [[World War II|war]] on Nazi Germany. War with the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. He was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. [[Buckingham Palace]] was bombed during [[the Blitz]] while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|largely broken away]], followed by [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947. George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]] in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1952. He was succeeded by his daughter, Elizabeth II.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Four kings: [[Edward VII]] (far right); his son George, Prince of Wales, later [[George V]] (far left); and grandsons Edward, later [[Edward VIII]] (rear); and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]\n\nThe future George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329</ref> His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]).

The close and loving family lived at 145 [[Piccadilly]], rather than one of the royal palaces.<ref>Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231</ref> One of the few stirs arose when the [[Canadian prime minister]], [[R.

In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Westminster Hall]].\n\nAs Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by [[British prime minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<ref>Judd, p. 140</ref> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, \"When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.\"<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286</ref>\n\nOn the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<ref>Townsend, p. 93</ref>\n\nAcross Britain gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of handling the kingship. He worried about that himself.

He had been introduced as \"His Royal Highness Prince Edward\" for the abdication broadcast,<ref>Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224</ref> but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including \"Royal Highness\".<ref>Howarth, p. 143</ref> In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title \"[[Duke of Windsor]]\" with the style \"Royal Highness\", but the [[letters patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.<ref>Ziegler, p. 326</ref> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Bradford, p. 223</ref>\n\n[[George VI's coronation]] at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation.

Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.<ref>Bradford, pp. 269, 281</ref>\n\nThe growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].<ref name=\"matthew\"/><ref>Sinclair, p. 230</ref> When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.<ref name=\"matthew\" /> While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\".<ref>[[Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 \"Mourning will be brief\"], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009</ref>\n[[File:FDR-George-VI-Potomac-June-9-1939-2-detail-crop.jpg|thumb|[[Franklin D.

Arthur George; 14 December 1895&nbsp;\u2013 6 February 1952) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death.\n\nKnown as \"Bertie\" among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923, and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had [[speech therapy]] for a [[stammer]], which he never fully overcame.\n\nGeorge's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, Edward was forced to choose between the crown and marriage to divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. With the [[abdication of Edward]] to marry Simpson, George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].\n\nIn September 1939, the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth&nbsp;\u2013 except Ireland&nbsp;\u2013 declared [[World War II|war]] on Nazi Germany. War with the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. He was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. [[Buckingham Palace]] was bombed during [[the Blitz]] while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|largely broken away]], followed by [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947. George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]] in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Westminster Hall]].\n\nAs Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by [[British prime minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<ref>Judd, p. 140</ref> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary.

The next day, it passed the [[External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<ref>Townsend, p. 93</ref>\n\nAcross Britain gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of handling the kingship.

George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.<ref>Ziegler, p. 326</ref> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Bradford, p. 223</ref>\n\n[[George VI's coronation]] at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation.

Ryan''' (born February 21, 1946) is an American sportswriter formerly for ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. He has been described as \"the quintessential American sportswriter\" and a basketball guru<ref>[[Dan Shaughnessy]], [[Bill Simmons]], and many others</ref> and is well known for his coverage of the sport including his famous stories covering the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 1970s. After graduating from [[Boston College]], Ryan started as a sports intern for the ''Globe'' on the same day as [[Peter Gammons]],<ref name=GB1>SportsFanMag.com [http://www.sportsfanmagazine.com/sfm/articles.html?id=1278 article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220423/http://www.sportsfanmagazine.com/sfm/articles.html?id=1278 |date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref> and later worked with other Globe sports writing legends  [[Will McDonough]] and [[Leigh Montville]]. Ryan announced in early 2012 his retirement from sports writing after 44 years once the 2012 Olympic Games concluded. His final column in ''The Boston Globe'' was published August 12, 2012.  \n\n==Biography and career==\n\n===Personal background===\nBorn in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Ryan grew up in a house, \"that revolved around going to games\"<ref>Replacement Level Podcast: Featuring Bob Ryan, http://www.replacementlevelpodcast.com/?p=38</ref> and went to high school at the [[Lawrenceville School]] from 1960 to 1964. He graduated from [[Boston College]] as a history major in 1968. Ryan and his wife Elaine have a daughter Jessica, and a son Keith who died in 2008. They are grandparents of triplets. They have been married since 1969.

Initial reports indicated that his death was an apparent suicide; however, reports in the Pakistani newspapers [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] and [[The News International]] indicated that Ryan's death may be investigated as a murder.

While covering the Celtics, Ryan developed a close relationship with the Celtics organization. Ryan would even go out to dinner with the team.<ref name=\"GB1\"/> Ryan sat at the press table eight seats from the Celtics' bench, where colleagues referred to him as the \"Commissioner\", not unlike [[Peter Gammons]]'s nickname. Boston Sports Media critic Bruce Allen<ref>Of [http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com bostonsportsmedia.com]</ref> has said, \"His passion is not faked.\"<ref>[http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com/archives/2006/06/10_people_whose_work_i_admire_1.php Post] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121200641/http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com/archives/2006/06/10_people_whose_work_i_admire_1.php |date=November 21, 2006 }} on [http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com bostonsportsmedia.com], \"10 people whose work I enjoy in the Boston Sports Media\", Ryan is included on the list, also included fellow sports columnist at the ''Globe'' [[Jackie MacMullan]]</ref>\n\nOne night [[Hue Hollins]], the referee, went to the press table to explain a call to Ryan during a time-out even though he was not obligated to. Another time Ryan wrote a column about the [[Washington Bullets]]' [[Rick Mahorn]] and how he played dirty under the hoop. When Mahorn was called for a foul [[Gene Shue]], the Bullets' coach, turned around and said, \"That's your fault, Bob Ryan, your fault!\" [[Dennis Johnson]] was often annoyed with Ryan and would go up to the press table and say, \"Hey, Bob, keep it down. We got a game going on here\" when Ryan sideline coached.<ref>''Ever Green'' by [[Dan Shaughnessy]], p. 46-7</ref> From Ryan's first column on [[Larry Bird]] headlined \"Celtics draft Bird for oh what a future\" to his last \"Larry!

Ryan, who began writing for the ''Globe'' in Heinsohn's rookie season as a coach, would make friends with the players and vent their feelings towards Heinsohn, their fans, and their teammates, claims Heinsohn. Heinsohn didn't like how he didn't feel in control of his team. Heinsohn believes that Ryan started to \"think of himself as another member of the family\" and that he even started coaching the team through his beat stories. Heinsohn goes on to talk about Ryan's bloated ego and the fact that he was then thinking of himself as a basketball guru. Heinsohn also says while noting disapproval of Ryan that at the time anyone who lived in Boston and even remotely followed basketball read Bob Ryan.<ref>''Give Em' the Hook'' by [[Tom Heinsohn]], Joe Fitzgerald</ref> In recent years Ryan has been less critical of Celtics coaches, including [[Doc Rivers]], of whom he said, \"I'm a Doc guy.\"\n\n=== General sports columnist ===\n\nIn 1982 Ryan would hand the torch of the ''Globe'' Celtics beat to then-not well known [[Dan Shaughnessy]], and later [[Jackie MacMullan]]. He did this in order to go to [[WCVB]] for a couple of years. Ryan ended up hating it and moved back to the Celtics beat in 1984 for two more seasons before getting promoted to general sports columnist in 1989.<ref>A [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0762418400 bio] of him on a page of one of his books</ref>\n\nRyan would cover 20 [[NBA]] finals, 20 Final Fours, nine [[World Series]], five [[Super Bowl]]s, the last seven Olympics and many other events. In recent times Ryan has become less basketball-oriented and more general sports-oriented. He continues to write for Basketball Times.

I enjoy my job and I still think I do it well, but they are chipping away, chipping away and they are making it far less pleasurable. I want to get out when I feel like getting out. If you stay around too long, there is no way you can dictate your terms,\" he said. Ryan also asked, \"How do you explain to [[Stephen A. Smith]] that he has no idea of the game and how much fun it was? He thinks he knows everything, but he will never know what I know about the Celtics.\"<ref name=\"GB1\"/>\n\nOn February 14, 2012,  during a podcast with [[Bill Simmons]] on Grantland.com, Ryan announced that he would retire after the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Said Ryan, \"I really and truly believe that my time has come and gone; that the dynamics of the business, of what it takes, what it means to be involved in the sports business with all the Tweeting and the blogging and all the stuff, and an audience with a different taste - it's not me anymore. I'm not comfortable.\" Ryan indicated that he would stay involved with sports in a part-time capacity after retirement, but is not interested in continuing at the pace he does now. Ryan's last day as a Red Sox reporter was July 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2012/07/red-sox-live-blog-carl-crawford-batting-second-in-return-kevin-youkilis-back-in-boston-with-new-sox.html |title=Red Sox Live Blog: Adrian Gonzalez Powers Red Sox to 5-1 Win Over White Sox - Boston Red Sox |publisher=NESN.com |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref>\n\nRyan's final column in ''The Boston Globe'' was published August 12, 2012.

While covering the Celtics, Ryan developed a close relationship with the Celtics organization. Ryan would even go out to dinner with the team.<ref name=\"GB1\"/> Ryan sat at the press table 8 seats from the Celtics' bench, where colleagues referred to him as the \"Commissioner\", not unlike [[Peter Gammons]]'s nickname.

Another time Ryan wrote a column about the [[Washington Bullets]]' [[Rick Mahorn]] and how he played dirty under the hoop. When Mahorn was called for a foul [[Gene Shue]], the Bullets' coach, turned around and said, \"That's your fault, Bob Ryan, your fault!\" [[Dennis Johnson]] was often annoyed with Ryan and would go up to the press table and say, \"Hey, Bob, keep it down.

Ryan, who began writing for the ''Globe'' in Heinsohn's rookie season as a coach, would make friends with the players and vent their feelings towards Heinsohn, their fans, and their teammates, claims Heinsohn. Heinsohn didn't like how he didn't feel in control of his team. Heinsohn believes that Ryan started to \"think of himself as another member of the family\" and that he even started coaching the team through his beat stories. Heinsohn goes on to talk about Ryan's bloated ego and the fact that he was then thinking of himself as a basketball guru. Heinsohn also says while noting disapproval of Ryan that at the time anyone who lived in Boston and even remotely followed basketball read Bob Ryan.<ref>''Give Em' the Hook'' by [[Tom Heinsohn]], Joe Fitzgerald</ref> In recent years Ryan has been less critical of Celtics coaches, including [[Doc Rivers]], of whom he said, \"I'm a Doc guy.\"\n\n=== General sports columnist ===\n\nIn 1982 Ryan would hand the torch of the ''Globe'' Celtics beat to then-not well known [[Dan Shaughnessy]], and later [[Jackie MacMullan]]. He did this in order to go to [[WCVB]] for a couple of years. Ryan ended up hating it and moved back to the Celtics beat in 1984 for two more seasons before getting promoted to general sports columnist in 1989.<ref>A [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0762418400 bio] of him on a page of one of his books</ref>\n\nRyan would cover 20 [[NBA]] finals, 20 Final Fours, nine [[World Series]], five [[Super Bowl]]s, the last seven Olympics and many other events.

I enjoy my job and I still think I do it well, but they are chipping away, chipping away and they are making it far less pleasurable. I want to get out when I feel like getting out. If you stay around too long, there is no way you can dictate your terms,\" he said. Ryan also asked, \"How do you explain to [[Stephen A.
