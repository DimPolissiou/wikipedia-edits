The railroad bridge was built between 1928 and 1930 for [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to replace its train ferry between Benicia and [[Port Costa, California]]. It is the second-longest railway bridge in North America, and the longest railway bridge west of the Mississippi River. Before the bridge was completed, ferries were used to allow the railway to cross Suisun Bay. The original ferry, built at [[Oakland, California]] in 1879 and named the ''[[Solano (ferry)|Solano]]'', was the world's largest train ferry. In 1914 the larger ''Contra Costa'' was built. In 1926 the ferries carried 93,000 passenger cars and 142,000 freight cars across the Strait.<ref>''Railway Age'' 9 March 1929 p576</ref>\n\nTrain ferry service ended in 1930 with the completion of the railroad bridge. [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] and [[Amtrak]] also run here on [[trackage rights]]. The drawbridge has the smallest clearances of the three bridges \u2014 [[Vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] horizontal clearance is 291 feet and vertical clearances are 70 feet (closed) and 135 feet (open).\n\n==Northbound span==\nIn late 2001, construction began on a newer bridge east of and parallel to the railroad bridge. It measures about <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1.7&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(2.7&nbsp;km)</span>. The new bridge carries five lanes of northbound traffic. The older bridge underwent [[seismic retrofit]]s and now carries four lanes of southbound traffic and a [[bicycle]]/pedestrian lane, part of the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]]. The bridge construction included a new toll plaza with nine toll booths, two [[open road tolling]] lanes and one carpool lane at the south end of the bridge, although tolls continue to be charged only for northbound traffic. The old toll plaza at the north end of the bridge was removed.\n\nThe new toll plaza was retrofitted for open road tolling to encourage FasTrak use. This required the removal of eight toll booths.\n\nThe bridge is the largest lightweight concrete segmental bridge in [[California]]. The estimated cost was $1.05 billion, the final cost was $1.3 billion. The original estimated cost was around $300 million, it is noted for its large delay in construction and large over cost (over $1 billion). The project's cost overshadowed [[Cypress Street Viaduct|the replacement of the Cypress Freeway portion]] of [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]].

The railroad bridge was built between 1928 and 1930 for [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to replace its train ferry between Benicia and [[Port Costa, California]]. It is the second-longest railway bridge in North America, and the longest railway bridge west of the Mississippi River. Before the bridge was completed, ferries were used to allow the railway to cross Suisun Bay. The original ferry, built at [[Oakland, California]] in 1879 and named the ''[[Solano (ferry)|Solano]]'', was the world's largest train ferry. In 1914 the larger ''Contra Costa'' was built. In 1926 the ferries carried 93,000 passenger cars and 142,000 freight cars across the Strait.<ref>''Railway Age'' 9 March 1929 p576</ref>\n\nTrain ferry service ended in 1930 with the completion of the railroad bridge. [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] and [[Amtrak]] also run here on [[trackage rights]]. The drawbridge has the smallest clearances of the three bridges \u2014 [[Vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] horizontal clearance is 291 feet and vertical clearances are 70 feet (closed) and 135 feet (open).\n\n==Northbound span==\nIn late 2001, construction began on a newer bridge east of and parallel to the railroad bridge. It measures about <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1.7&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(2.7&nbsp;km)</span>. The new bridge carries five lanes of northbound traffic. The older bridge underwent [[seismic retrofit]]s and now carries four lanes of southbound traffic and a [[bicycle]]/pedestrian lane, part of the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]]. The bridge construction included a new toll plaza with nine toll booths, two [[open road tolling]] lanes and one carpool lane at the south end of the bridge, although tolls continue to be charged only for northbound traffic. The old toll plaza at the north end of the bridge was removed.\n\nThe new toll plaza was retrofitted for open road tolling to encourage FasTrak use. This required the removal of eight toll booths.\n\nThe bridge is the largest lightweight concrete segmental bridge in [[California]]. The estimated cost was $1.05 billion, the final cost was $1.3 billion.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre. The five or more performers with their leader called Kaliachan enter the performance area after a ritualistic bath, with sandalwood paste over their foreheads, dressed in white dhoti, and with a towel wrapped around their heads.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Arjuna Nrtam (Mayilppili Tukkam)===\n\n[[Mayilpeeli Thookkam|Arjuna Nrtam]] (\"the dance of [[Arjuna]]\") or Mayilppili Tukkam is a ritual art performed by men of Ezhava community and is prevalent in the [[Bhagavathy]] temples of south Kerala, mainly in [[Kollam]], Alappuzha and [[Kottayam]] districts. Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of [[snake worship]] and [[Kalarippayattu]].<ref name = \"ezh22\"/><ref name = \"ezh23\"/>\n\n===Poorakkali===\nPoorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of [[Meenam]] (March\u2013April).  Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu, a system of physical exercise formerly in vogue in Kerala.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Teyyam (Teyyattam) or Kaliyattam===\nIn northern Kerala, [[Theyyam|Teyyam]] is a popular [[ritual dance]].

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as [[Mappilla]]s.<ref name=\"Gough313\" /> A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central [[Travancore]] and in the [[Western Ghats|High Ranges]], embraced [[Christianity]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], due to caste-based discrimination.

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques.

In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators.

Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called '''Arabic gum''' (not to be confused with [[gum arabic]]) and '''Yemen gum'''. In [[Greece]], it is known as '''tears of Chios''', being traditionally produced on the island [[Chios]], and, like other natural resins, is produced in \"tears\" or droplets.\n\nOriginally a sap, mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white and opaque gum. The flavor is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing flavor similar to pine and cedar.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mastiha.jpg|thumb|Traditional collecting of mastic on the island of Chios]]\nMastic has been harvested for at least 2,500 years since Greek Antiquity.{{cn|date=July 2019}} The word ''mastic'' is derived from {{lang-el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|mastichein}} \"to gnash the teeth\",{{cn|date=July 2019}} which is also the source of the English word ''masticate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/mastic.html |title=Mastic @ The EpicentreThe Epicentre |publisher=Theepicentre.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2019}} The first mention of actual mastic 'tears' was by [[Hippocrates]]. Hippocrates used mastic for the prevention of digestive problems, colds and as a breath freshener. Roman emperors used mastic along with honey, pepper, and egg in the spiced wine ''[[Conditum|conditum paradoxum]]''. Under the Byzantine Empire, the trade of mastic was made the emperor's monopoly. In the Ottoman Empire, the sultan gathered the finest mastic crop to send it to his harem.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule of Chios, mastic was worth its weight in gold. The penalty for stealing mastic was execution by order of the sultan. In the [[Chios Massacre]] of 1822, the people of the Mastichochoria region were spared by the sultan to provide mastic to him and his harem. ''Sak\u0131z Adas\u0131'', the Turkish name for the island of Chios, means \"island of gum\".  The mastic villages are fortress-like, out of sight from the sea, surrounded by high walls and with no doors at street level (meaning that the villages were entered only by ladders), in order to protect the sap from invaders.\n\nAlthough the liqueur is much younger, it is still tied up with Greek history. Digestive liqueurs, similar to Mastiha but made with grapes, were known as the Greek elixirs before the French Revolution.\n\nThe production of mastic was threatened by the [[2012 Chios forest fire|Chios forest fire]] that destroyed some mastic groves in August 2012.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nProducing the mastic resin is a whole-year process for the local growers. The harvest is known as ''kentos'' and takes place from the beginning of July to the beginning of October. First, the area around the trees is cleared and sprinkled with inert [[calcium carbonate]]. Then, every 4\u20135 days, 5\u201310 incisions are made in the bark of each tree to release the resin. As these clear drops hang from the tree, and sparkle in the sunlight, they are said to resemble crystalline teardrops; for this reason, the mastic resin is known as the \"tears of Chios\". It takes about 15\u201320 days for the first resin crystals to harden and fall to the ground. The farmers then collect the pieces of dry mastic and wash them in natural spring water, and spend most of the winter cleaning and separating the tears from the sand. This cleaning process is performed by hand and is regulated by the legislative framework of the Mastic Growers' Association. In addition to mastic, mastic oil is also produced.\n\n=== Mastichochoria ===\n{{main article|Mastichochoria}}\n[[File:Gotaq.jpg|upright|thumb|250px|right|A single drop of mastic hangs from the underside of this branch on a mastic tree.]]\n{{as of|2018}} there were twenty-four mastichochoria, or mastic villages, on the island of Chios dedicated to the cultivation and production of mastic.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Mastic production in [[Chios]] is protected by a [[European Union]] [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation of origin]].\n\nThe island's mastic production is controlled by a co-operative.

In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called '''Arabic gum''' (not to be confused with [[gum arabic]]) and '''Yemen gum'''. It is called in Urdu \u0645\u0635\u0637\u06af\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u0645\u06cc,In Arabic  \u0645\u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0645\u06cc,In Persian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0631\u0648\u0645\u06cc,In [[Greece]], it is known as '''tears of Chios''', being traditionally produced on the island [[Chios]], and, like other natural resins, is produced in \"tears\" or droplets.\n\nOriginally a sap, mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white and opaque gum. The flavor is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing flavor similar to pine and cedar.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mastiha.jpg|thumb|Traditional collecting of mastic on the island of Chios]]\nMastic has been harvested for at least 2,500 years since Greek Antiquity.{{cn|date=July 2019}} The word ''mastic'' is derived from {{lang-el|\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|mastichein}} \"to gnash the teeth\",{{cn|date=July 2019}} which is also the source of the English word ''masticate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/mastic.html |title=Mastic @ The EpicentreThe Epicentre |publisher=Theepicentre.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2019}} The first mention of actual mastic 'tears' was by [[Hippocrates]]. Hippocrates used mastic for the prevention of digestive problems, colds and as a breath freshener. Roman emperors used mastic along with honey, pepper, and egg in the spiced wine ''[[Conditum|conditum paradoxum]]''. Under the Byzantine Empire, the trade of mastic was made the emperor's monopoly. In the Ottoman Empire, the sultan gathered the finest mastic crop to send it to his harem.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule of Chios, mastic was worth its weight in gold. The penalty for stealing mastic was execution by order of the sultan. In the [[Chios Massacre]] of 1822, the people of the Mastichochoria region were spared by the sultan to provide mastic to him and his harem. ''Sak\u0131z Adas\u0131'', the Turkish name for the island of Chios, means \"island of gum\".  The mastic villages are fortress-like, out of sight from the sea, surrounded by high walls and with no doors at street level (meaning that the villages were entered only by ladders), in order to protect the sap from invaders.\n\nAlthough the liqueur is much younger, it is still tied up with Greek history. Digestive liqueurs, similar to Mastiha but made with grapes, were known as the Greek elixirs before the French Revolution.\n\nThe production of mastic was threatened by the [[2012 Chios forest fire|Chios forest fire]] that destroyed some mastic groves in August 2012.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nProducing the mastic resin is a whole-year process for the local growers. The harvest is known as ''kentos'' and takes place from the beginning of July to the beginning of October. First, the area around the trees is cleared and sprinkled with inert [[calcium carbonate]]. Then, every 4\u20135 days, 5\u201310 incisions are made in the bark of each tree to release the resin. As these clear drops hang from the tree, and sparkle in the sunlight, they are said to resemble crystalline teardrops; for this reason, the mastic resin is known as the \"tears of Chios\". It takes about 15\u201320 days for the first resin crystals to harden and fall to the ground. The farmers then collect the pieces of dry mastic and wash them in natural spring water, and spend most of the winter cleaning and separating the tears from the sand. This cleaning process is performed by hand and is regulated by the legislative framework of the Mastic Growers' Association. In addition to mastic, mastic oil is also produced.\n\n=== Mastichochoria ===\n{{main article|Mastichochoria}}\n[[File:Gotaq.jpg|upright|thumb|250px|right|A single drop of mastic hangs from the underside of this branch on a mastic tree.]]\n{{as of|2018}} there were twenty-four mastichochoria, or mastic villages, on the island of Chios dedicated to the cultivation and production of mastic.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Mastic production in [[Chios]] is protected by a [[European Union]] [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation of origin]].\n\nThe island's mastic production is controlled by a co-operative.

The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States ([[Alaska]]), Canada ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]), Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of [[Gr\u00edmsey]]).\n\n===Climate===\n{{Further|Climate of the Arctic}}\nThe climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the [[Gulf Stream]], which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in [[Norilsk]], Russia will sometimes reach as high as {{convert|30|C}}, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below {{convert|-50|C}}.\n\n===Sites along the Arctic Circle===\nStarting at the [[prime meridian]] and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\n{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0\n|- valign=top\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!

During World War II he commanded numerous divisions and corps in Europe and the Pacific.\n\n==Early life==\nWoodruff was born on February 9, 1891 in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]], the son of Rhoda Barnett Woodruff and Calvin Woodruff, an army officer. After attending numerous public schools and the [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]] State University, in 1911, aged 20, he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA). He was the first captain of the corps of cadets and, on June 12, 1915, he graduated from the USMA as part of the West Point class of 1915, often referred to as \"[[the class the stars fell on]]\". Subsequently he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]] of the [[United States Army]]. Among those he graduated with were [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Omar Bradley]], [[James Van Fleet]], [[Stafford LeRoy Irwin]], [[Charles W. Ryder]], [[Paul J. Mueller]], [[Leland Hobbs]], [[John B. Wogan]], and [[Vernon Prichard]]. All of these men would, like Woodruff, become [[general officer]]s in the future.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter graduation, he served on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]]. After the [[American entry into World War I]], which occurred in April 1917, Woodruff, as a young [[Captain (United States)|captain]], became a [[company commander]] in command of Company 'H' of the 2nd Battalion, [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. Woodruff was among the first of his West Point classmates to enter combat in World War I in the fall of 1917, when the division was sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as one of the first units of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF). This combat experience during 1917\u20131918 served Woodruff in good stead in his later command and staff assignments during the final stages of the war and in the post-war operations. The war came to an end on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]].\n\n===Between the wars===\nDuring the [[interwar period]] Woodruff remained in the army and attended various service schools. He attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|U.S. Army Command and General Staff School]] in the mid-1920s, graduating from there as an honor graduate in 1927. He then became an instructor there from 1927\u20131931. In 1931 he attended the [[United States Army War College|U.S. Army War College]]. He was then was a tactical officer at the USMA from 1932\u20131936. In 1938, Woodruff, now a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], served in the General Staff of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in the operations and tactics section.\n\n===World War II===\nAs a lieutenant colonel, he commanded the 2nd Battalion, [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]]. He then commanded the regiment, then stationed at [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[Texas]] from July 1941 to January 1942. His fellow West Point classmate, Lieutenant Colonel Dwight Eisenhower, also arrived there as the newly appointed [[chief of staff]] of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] in June 1941. Both men were at Fort Sam Houston during the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. The [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]] followed just four days later, which brought the United States into [[World War II]].\n\nWith the United States now at war, Woodruff was promoted to the [[One-star rank|one-star]] general officer rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and in March 1942, became the assistant division commander (ADC) of the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]], a unit in the [[United States Army Reserve|Organized Reserves]] which had been recently called up for [[active duty]].  The division was composed almost entirely of [[Conscription in the United States|conscripts]] (or \"draftees\"). From June 1942 to May 1943, Woodruff, recently promoted to the [[two-star rank]] of [[Major general (United States)|major general]], took full command of the division during its pre-deployment training in [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]] prior to its assignment to the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in the spring of 1944.\n\nIn May 1943, he relinquished command of the 77th Division to Major General [[Andrew Davis Bruce|A. D. Bruce]] and took command of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]], then stationed in [[England]]. Eisenhower, now a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|general]] and the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in Europe, initially selected Woodruff as one of three corps commanders, along with Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], commanding [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], and Major General [[Willis D. Crittenberger]], commanding [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]], for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]], which was then scheduled for May 1944. All three were well known and trusted by the Supreme Allied Commander.<ref>D'Este, p. 487-488</ref>\n\nWhen Woodruff's West Point classmate and fellow infantryman, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]], who had just arrived in England from serving in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO), was selected to command the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] for the upcoming Normandy invasion in October 1943, Bradley's concern was that his three corps commanders all lacked experience in [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] [[Military operation|operations]] or combat command. Neither Woodruff nor Gerow had fought in World War II and Crittenberger did not fight in either of the World Wars. Gerow, who was close to Eisenhower and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of General [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall, Jr.]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]], was retained, but Crittenberger moved to command of [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]], and Woodruff was shuffled off to command of XIX Corps, Crittenberger's former command, for several weeks, before returning to the United States, and he handed over command of XIX Corps to Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]]. Upon his return to the United States, Woodruff assumed command the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]], then in training at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], from March to June 1944.<ref>D'Este, p. 487-488</ref> Taking over the command of VII Corps was Major General [[J. Lawton Collins]], who had commanded the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] with distinction in the Pacific.\n\nIn November 1944, Woodruff's chance at large-scale combat command finally came as [[Commanding officer|commanding general]] (CG) of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] in the Southwest Pacific. His welcoming reception in the [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] was celebrated at the [[Paratrooper|paratroop]] headquarters, fueled with five gallons of torpedo alcohol, furnished by [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] patrol boat sailors, as the key ingredient for liquid refreshments. He led his command in the five month [[Battle of Mindanao]] to liberate that island of [[Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago from Japanese occupation in the closing phases of the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte campaign]].<ref>Morison, p.49.</ref>\n\n===Postwar===\nIn November 1945, after World War II had come to an end due to the surrender of both the Germans and the Japanese, Woodruff became commander of the [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]], part of the [[Eighth United States Army|U.S. Eighth Army]], during the Allied occupation force in southern Japan.<ref>Corps \u2013 A Brief History \u2013 1862\u20131953\n</ref><ref>''New York Times'', March 9, 1948.</ref>\n\nFrom February 1948 to March 1951, Woodruff was deputy commanding general of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] at [[Fort Jay]], [[Governors Island]], New York.<ref>''New York Times'', March 9, 1948.</ref> Woodruff assumed the role of [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] (CG) from January to March 1949 upon the retirement of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Courtney Hodges]], who had commanded the First Army during World War II, and again from October to November 1950 after General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] was appointed the Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).\n\nIn 1951, Woodruff took command of [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] at [[Fort Polk|Camp Polk (now Fort Polk)]], Louisiana.<ref>''New York Times'', February 20, 1951</ref> There he retired from the army, as a major general, in January 1953 after 41 years of active duty.<ref>''New York Times'', February 1, 1953</ref>\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nWoodruff and his wife, Alice Gray Woodruff retired to San Antonio, Texas. Woodruff died on July 24, 1975, aged 84.

During World War II he commanded numerous divisions and corps in Europe and the Pacific.\n\n==Early life==\nWoodruff was born on February 9, 1891 in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]], the son of Rhoda Barnett Woodruff and Calvin Woodruff, an army officer. After attending numerous public schools and the [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]] State University, in 1911, aged 20, he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA). He was the first captain of the corps of cadets and, on June 12, 1915, he graduated from the USMA as part of the West Point class of 1915, often referred to as \"[[the class the stars fell on]]\". Subsequently he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]] of the [[United States Army]]. Among those he graduated with were [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Omar Bradley]], [[James Van Fleet]], [[Stafford LeRoy Irwin]], [[Charles W. Ryder]], [[Paul J. Mueller]], [[Leland Hobbs]], [[John B. Wogan]], and [[Vernon Prichard]]. All of these men would, like Woodruff, become [[general officer]]s in the future.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter graduation, he served on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]]. After the [[American entry into World War I]], which occurred in April 1917, Woodruff, as a young [[Captain (United States)|captain]], became a [[company commander]] in command of Company 'H' of the 2nd Battalion, [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. Woodruff was among the first of his West Point classmates to enter combat in World War I in the fall of 1917, when the division was sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as one of the first units of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF). This combat experience during 1917\u20131918 served Woodruff in good stead in his later command and staff assignments during the final stages of the war and in the post-war operations. The war came to an end on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]].\n\n===Between the wars===\nDuring the [[interwar period]] Woodruff remained in the army and attended various service schools. He attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|U.S. Army Command and General Staff School]] in the mid-1920s, graduating from there as an honor graduate in 1927. He then became an instructor there from 1927\u20131931. In 1931 he attended the [[United States Army War College|U.S. Army War College]]. He was then was a tactical officer at the USMA from 1932\u20131936. In 1938, Woodruff, now a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], served in the General Staff of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in the operations and tactics section.\n\n===World War II===\nAs a lieutenant colonel, he commanded the 2nd Battalion, [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]]. He then commanded the regiment, then stationed at [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[Texas]] from July 1941 to January 1942. His fellow West Point classmate, Lieutenant Colonel Dwight Eisenhower, also arrived there as the newly appointed [[chief of staff]] of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] in June 1941. Both men were at Fort Sam Houston during the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. The [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]] followed just four days later, which brought the United States into [[World War II]].\n\nWith the United States now at war, Woodruff was promoted to the [[One-star rank|one-star]] general officer rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and in March 1942, became the assistant division commander (ADC) of the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]], a unit in the [[United States Army Reserve|Organized Reserves]] which had been recently called up for [[active duty]].  The division was composed almost entirely of [[Conscription in the United States|conscripts]] (or \"draftees\"). From June 1942 to May 1943, Woodruff, recently promoted to the [[two-star rank]] of [[Major general (United States)|major general]], took full command of the division during its pre-deployment training in [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]] prior to its assignment to the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in the spring of 1944.\n\nIn May 1943, he relinquished command of the 77th Division to Major General [[Andrew Davis Bruce|A. D. Bruce]] and took command of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]], then stationed in [[England]]. Eisenhower, now a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|general]] and the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in Europe, initially selected Woodruff as one of three corps commanders, along with Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], commanding [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], and Major General [[Willis D. Crittenberger]], commanding [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]], for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]], which was then scheduled for May 1944. All three were well known and trusted by the Supreme Allied Commander.<ref>D'Este, p. 487-488</ref>\n\nWhen Woodruff's West Point classmate and fellow infantryman, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]], who had just arrived in England from serving in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO), was selected to command the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] for the upcoming Normandy invasion in October 1943, Bradley's concern was that his three corps commanders all lacked experience in [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] [[Military operation|operations]] or combat command. Neither Woodruff nor Gerow had fought in World War II and Crittenberger did not fight in either of the World Wars. Gerow, who was close to Eisenhower and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of General [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall, Jr.]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]], was retained, but Crittenberger moved to command of [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]], and Woodruff was shuffled off to command of XIX Corps, Crittenberger's former command, for several weeks, before returning to the United States, and he handed over command of XIX Corps to Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]]. Upon his return to the United States, Woodruff assumed command the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]], then in training at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], from March to June 1944.<ref>D'Este, p. 487-488</ref> Taking over the command of VII Corps was Major General [[J. Lawton Collins]], who had commanded the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] with distinction in the Pacific.\n\nIn November 1944, Woodruff's chance at large-scale combat command finally came as [[Commanding officer|commanding general]] (CG) of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] in the Southwest Pacific. His welcoming reception in the [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] was celebrated at the [[Paratrooper|paratroop]] headquarters, fueled with five gallons of torpedo alcohol, furnished by [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] patrol boat sailors, as the key ingredient for liquid refreshments. He led his command in the five month [[Battle of Mindanao]] to liberate that island of [[Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago from Japanese occupation in the closing phases of the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte campaign]].<ref>Morison, p.49.</ref>\n\n===Postwar===\nIn November 1945, after World War II had come to an end due to the surrender of both the Germans and the Japanese, Woodruff became commander of the [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]], part of the [[Eighth United States Army|U.S. Eighth Army]], during the Allied occupation force in southern Japan.<ref>Corps \u2013 A Brief History \u2013 1862\u20131953\n</ref><ref>''New York Times'', March 9, 1948.</ref>\n\nFrom February 1948 to March 1951, Woodruff was deputy commanding general of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] at [[Fort Jay]], [[Governors Island]], New York.<ref>''New York Times'', March 9, 1948.</ref> Woodruff assumed the role of [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] (CG) from January to March 1949 upon the retirement of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Courtney Hodges]], who had commanded the First Army during World War II, and again from October to November 1950 after General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] was appointed the Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).\n\nIn 1951, Woodruff took command of [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] at [[Fort Polk|Camp Polk (now Fort Polk)]], Louisiana.<ref>''New York Times'', February 20, 1951</ref> There he retired from the army, as a major general, in January 1953 after 41 years of active duty.<ref>''New York Times'', February 1, 1953</ref>\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nWoodruff and his wife, Alice Gray Woodruff retired to San Antonio, Texas. Woodruff died on July 24, 1975, aged 84. He was buried in the [[Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery]].\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n*[[File:Distinguished Service Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] with [[Oak leaf cluster|Oak Leaf Cluster]]\n*[[File:SilverStar.gif|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Silver Star]] with two Oak Leaf Clusters\n*[[File:Bronze Star ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with Oak Leaf Cluster\n*[[File:Air Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Air Medal]] with Oak Leaf Cluster\n*[[File:Army Commendation Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Army Commendation Medal]]\n*[[File:Purple Heart ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Purple Heart]]\n*[[File:World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]]\n*[[File:World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[World War II Victory Medal]]\n*[[File:Mexican Border Service Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Mexican Border Service Medal]]\n*[[File:American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[American Defense Service Medal]]\n*[[File:American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[American Campaign Medal]]\n*[[File:European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]]\n*[[File:Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|60px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Army of Occupation Medal]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last =Ray|first =Max|title =The History of the First United States Army From 1918 to 1980|publisher =First United States Army|year=1980|location =Fort Meade MD|isbn =}}\n*{{cite book|last =D'Este|first =Carlo|title = Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life|publisher = Henry Holt|year=2002|pages = [https://archive.org/details/eisenhowersoldie00dest/page/486 486]\u2013487|url = https://archive.org/details/eisenhowersoldie00dest|url-access =registration|quote =roscoe b woodruff.|isbn =978-0-8050-5686-0}}\n*{{cite book|last = |first =   |title = I Corps - A Brief History - 1862-1953|publisher = U.S. Army, G-3 Historical Section, I Corps|year= |location =|url = http://www.koreanwar-educator.org/topics/brief/icorps.htm|isbn =}}\n*{{cite book|last = Morison|first = Samuel Eliot|title = History of United States Naval Operations in World War II.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, [[William Hartnell]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]].

Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981.

Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth series]], and ten episodes from the  [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]]. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale.

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979.

The AUS is designed to supplement the function of the natural [[urinary sphincter]] that restricts urine flow out of the [[bladder]].\n\n==Description==\nThere are two types of artificial urinary sphincters:\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a balloon reservoir (3-component): cuff, pump and balloon. The cuff is placed around the urethra; the pump is inserted in the scrotum and the balloon reservoir is implanted in the retropubic space \u2013 between bladder and iliac vein. The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the elastic balloon reservoir and from retropubic pressure.<ref name=\"AU\" /><ref name=\"Urodynamic\" />\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a spring (2-component): cuff and pump unit.<ref name =\"Bauer\">{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Ricarda M. |last2=Gozzi |first2=Christian |last3=H\u00fcbner |first3=Wilhelm |last4=Nitti |first4=Victor W. |last5=Novara |first5=Giacomo |last6=Peterson |first6=Andrew |last7=Sandhu |first7=Jaspreet S. |last8=Stief |first8=Christian G. |title=Contemporary Management of Postprostatectomy Incontinence |journal=European Urology |date=June 2011 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=985\u2013996 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2011.03.020 |pmid=21458914 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302283811002648 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Cordon\">{{cite journal |last1=Cordon |first1=Billy H |last2=Singla |first2=Nirmish |last3=Singla |first3=Ajay K |title=Artificial urinary sphincters for male stress urinary incontinence: current perspectives |journal=Medical Devices: Evidence and Research |date=4 July 2016 |volume=2016 |issue=9 |pages=175\u2013183 |doi=10.2147/MDER.S93637 |pmid=27445509 |pmc=4938139}}</ref> The cuff is placed around the urethra and the pump unit is inserted in the [[scrotum]]. The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the spring of the pump unit. The pressure in the [[retropubic space]] does not have any influence for this type of sphincter.\n\nThe common theme among currently available designs is a mechanical constriction mechanism \u2013 an inflatable cuff filled with sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and placed around the [[urethra]] which keeps the urethral lumen closed; this is due to the pressure produced inside the device and an externally accessible control pump mechanism placed between two skin layers of the scrotum (subdartos pouch) which allows the user to manually relieve the constriction to allow urination.\n\n==History==\n[[File:AMS 800 and ZSI 375 artificial urinary sphincters.jpg|thumb|284px|Artificial urinary sphincters (left to right: AMS 800 and ZSI 375)]]\nFrederic Foley was the first to describe an externally worn artificial urinary sphincter to treat urinary incontinence, published in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley |first1=Frederic E.B. |title=An Artificial Sphincter: A New Device and Operation for Control of Enuresis and Urinary Incontinence |journal=Journal of Urology |date=October 1947 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=250\u2013259 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(17)69552-1 |pmid=20266239 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534717695521 |accessdate=5 February 2020}}</ref> In 1972, F.

The AUS is designed to supplement the function of the natural [[urinary sphincter]] that restricts urine flow out of the [[bladder]].\n\n==Description==\nThere are two types of artificial urinary sphincters:\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a balloon reservoir (3-component): cuff, pump and balloon. The cuff is placed around the urethra; the pump is inserted in the scrotum and the balloon reservoir is implanted in the retropubic space \u2013 between bladder and iliac vein. The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the elastic balloon reservoir and from retropubic pressure.<ref name=\"AU\" /><ref name=\"Urodynamic\" />\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a spring (2-component): cuff and pump unit.<ref name =\"Bauer\">{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Ricarda M. |last2=Gozzi |first2=Christian |last3=H\u00fcbner |first3=Wilhelm |last4=Nitti |first4=Victor W. |last5=Novara |first5=Giacomo |last6=Peterson |first6=Andrew |last7=Sandhu |first7=Jaspreet S. |last8=Stief |first8=Christian G. |title=Contemporary Management of Postprostatectomy Incontinence |journal=European Urology |date=June 2011 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=985\u2013996 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2011.03.020 |pmid=21458914 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302283811002648 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Cordon\">{{cite journal |last1=Cordon |first1=Billy H |last2=Singla |first2=Nirmish |last3=Singla |first3=Ajay K |title=Artificial urinary sphincters for male stress urinary incontinence: current perspectives |journal=Medical Devices: Evidence and Research |date=4 July 2016 |volume=2016 |issue=9 |pages=175\u2013183 |doi=10.2147/MDER.S93637 |pmid=27445509 |pmc=4938139}}</ref> The cuff is placed around the urethra and the pump unit is inserted in the [[scrotum]].
