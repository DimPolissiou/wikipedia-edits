In 1979, MGM joined forces with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]], the home video division of the [[CBS]] television network, and established '''MGM/CBS Home Video'''. In October of that year, they released their first batch of Betamax and VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=%22MGM+CBS%22+Billboard&source=bl&ots=_yRY29MTdL&sig=3j5u0LdCHS-AAC77tJ0FQld_Rk0&hl=en&ei=hTSrTZf0LYnW0QG90pX5CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=22 November 1980|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref><!--This is for informational purposes only.-->\n\nThe initial printings of all 24 films were packaged in brown leather clamshell cases with gold lettering; they were presented to CBS executives. Later printings of these films, as well as all printings of later releases by MGM/CBS, were packaged in oversized gray book-style boxes with either the MGM Abstract Lion print logo or CBS Video print logo in the upper right hand corner of the packaging. MGM/CBS also issued some early tapes of [[Lorimar]] product; those releases would instead bear the Lorimar print logo where the MGM or CBS Video print logo would normally be.\n\n===MGM/UA era, distribution deal with Turner Entertainment (1982-1998)===\nIn 1982, a year after MGM bought and merged with the near-bankrupt [[United Artists]] from [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]], CBS dropped out of the video partnership with MGM and moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to create [[CBS/Fox Video]]. MGM's video division became known as '''MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, Inc.''', more commonly known as '''MGM/UA Home Video'''. MGM/UA continued to license pre-1981 UA and [[Associated Artists Productions|pre-1950]] [[Warner Bros.|WB]] films (as well as some post-1981 titles) to CBS/Fox (due to an agreement UA had with Fox years earlier dating back to when CBS/Fox Home Video was called [[Magnetic Video]]).\n\nIn 1986, MGM's pre-May 1986 library (also including the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros.]] library, ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, and most US rights to the [[RKO Pictures]] library), was acquired by [[Ted Turner]] and his company [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]. After the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to '''Turner Home Entertainment''').\n\nIn October 1990, after [[Path\u00e9]] bought MGM, MGM/UA Home Video struck a deal with [[Warner Home Video]] to have them distribute MGM/UA titles exclusively on home video.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716231858/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris102504.html Robert Harris interview with George Feltenstein] ''TheDigitalBits.com'' (October 28, 2004)</ref> MGM/UA began distributing the UA library after its contract with CBS/Fox ended. In 1995, MGM/UA Home Video launched the '''MGM/UA Family Entertainment''' label for family-friendly releases. In 1996, Warner made an exclusive deal with [[Image Entertainment]] to distribute MGM/UA titles on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IMAGE+ENTERTAINMENT+ACQUIRES+EXCLUSIVE+RIGHTS+TO+PACKAGE+OF+MGM%252FUA...-a017981437|title=IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO PACKAGE OF MGM/UA TITLES FOR LASERDISC - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, MGM/UA, along with the other studios that were distributed by Warner Home Video, began releasing its titles on [[DVD]]. Some of the films MGM released on DVD were from the Turner catalog, which they were still allowed to keep after Turner merged into [[Time Warner]] some time before because of their distribution deal. That same year, MGM acquired [[Orion Pictures]]. As a result, '''Orion Home Video''' (Orion's home video division) was bought out by MGM/UA, and was retained as an in-name-only division until the acquisition deal was finalized in 1998. In 1998, the company was renamed '''MGM Home Entertainment''' and MGM/UA Family Entertainment was renamed '''MGM Family Entertainment'''.\n\n===MGM Home Entertainment (1998-2005)===\nIn March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. $225 million to end their distribution agreement in February 2000; the initial deal was to have expired in 2003. As a result of the deal, MGM gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> Upon the expiration of the Warner deal, MGM sold overseas video rights to [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+and+Fox+Form+International+Distribution+and+Strategic+Alliance.-a054937422|title=MGM and Fox Form International Distribution and Strategic Alliance. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, MGM and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].com launched the \"MGM Movie Vault\" to distribute VHS copies of selected films, either previously unreleased on video or long out-of-print, exclusively through Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Amazon.com+and+MGM+Home+Entertainment+Partner+to+Raise+the+Curtain+On...-a070701621|title=Amazon.com and MGM Home Entertainment Partner to Raise the Curtain On MGM's Legendary Film Vault. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nOn March 3, 2003, MGM Home Entertainment launched the '''MGM Kids''' sub-label.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/mgm-purrs-with-kidvid-label/</ref>.\n\n===Partnerships with [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] (2005-present)===\nIn 2005, following MGM's acquisition by the [[Sony]]-led consortium, MGM started releasing all their new products through [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] under the standard MGM label.\n\nIn 2006, after MGM ended their distribution agreement with Sony, they announced that they would be signing a new distribution deal with [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. Originally, DVD releases of MGM/UA and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] co-releases continued to be distributed by SPHE, since Sony then still owned 20% of MGM, whereas Fox has no controlling interest; however, Fox has since released DVD editions of films based on MGM IPs.

In 1979, MGM joined forces with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]], the home video division of the [[CBS]] television network, and established '''MGM/CBS Home Video'''. In October of that year, they released their first batch of Betamax and VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=%22MGM+CBS%22+Billboard&source=bl&ots=_yRY29MTdL&sig=3j5u0LdCHS-AAC77tJ0FQld_Rk0&hl=en&ei=hTSrTZf0LYnW0QG90pX5CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=22 November 1980|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref><!--This is for informational purposes only.-->\n\nThe initial printings of all 24 films were packaged in brown leather clamshell cases with gold lettering; they were presented to CBS executives. Later printings of these films, as well as all printings of later releases by MGM/CBS, were packaged in oversized gray book-style boxes with either the MGM Abstract Lion print logo or CBS Video print logo in the upper right hand corner of the packaging. MGM/CBS also issued some early tapes of [[Lorimar]] product; those releases would instead bear the Lorimar print logo where the MGM or CBS Video print logo would normally be.\n\n===MGM/UA era, distribution deal with Turner Entertainment (1982-1998)===\nIn 1982, a year after MGM bought and merged with the near-bankrupt [[United Artists]] from [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]], CBS dropped out of the video partnership with MGM and moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to create [[CBS/Fox Video]]. MGM's video division became known as '''MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, Inc.''', more commonly known as '''MGM/UA Home Video'''. MGM/UA continued to license pre-1981 UA and [[Associated Artists Productions|pre-1950]] [[Warner Bros.|WB]] films (as well as some post-1981 titles) to CBS/Fox (due to an agreement UA had with Fox years earlier dating back to when CBS/Fox Home Video was called [[Magnetic Video]]).\n\nIn 1986, MGM's pre-May 1986 library (also including the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros.]] library, ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, and most US rights to the [[RKO Pictures]] library), was acquired by [[Ted Turner]] and his company [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]. After the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to '''Turner Home Entertainment''').\n\nIn October 1990, after [[Path\u00e9]] bought MGM, MGM/UA Home Video struck a deal with [[Warner Home Video]] to have them distribute MGM/UA titles exclusively on home video.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716231858/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris102504.html Robert Harris interview with George Feltenstein] ''TheDigitalBits.com'' (October 28, 2004)</ref> MGM/UA began distributing the UA library after its contract with CBS/Fox ended. In 1995, MGM/UA Home Video launched the '''MGM/UA Family Entertainment''' label for family-friendly releases. In 1996, Warner made an exclusive deal with [[Image Entertainment]] to distribute MGM/UA titles on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IMAGE+ENTERTAINMENT+ACQUIRES+EXCLUSIVE+RIGHTS+TO+PACKAGE+OF+MGM%252FUA...-a017981437|title=IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO PACKAGE OF MGM/UA TITLES FOR LASERDISC - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, MGM/UA, along with the other studios that were distributed by Warner Home Video, began releasing its titles on [[DVD]]. Some of the films MGM released on DVD were from the Turner catalog, which they were still allowed to keep after Turner merged into [[Time Warner]] some time before because of their distribution deal. That same year, MGM acquired [[Orion Pictures]]. As a result, '''Orion Home Video''' (Orion's home video division) was bought out by MGM/UA, and was retained as an in-name-only division until the acquisition deal was finalized in 1998. In 1998, the company was renamed '''MGM Home Entertainment''' and MGM/UA Family Entertainment was renamed '''MGM Family Entertainment'''.\n\n===MGM Home Entertainment (1998-2005)===\nIn March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. $225 million to end their distribution agreement in February 2000; the initial deal was to have expired in 2003. As a result of the deal, MGM gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> Upon the expiration of the Warner deal, MGM sold overseas video rights to [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+and+Fox+Form+International+Distribution+and+Strategic+Alliance.-a054937422|title=MGM and Fox Form International Distribution and Strategic Alliance. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, MGM and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].com launched the \"MGM Movie Vault\" to distribute VHS copies of selected films, either previously unreleased on video or long out-of-print, exclusively through Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Amazon.com+and+MGM+Home+Entertainment+Partner+to+Raise+the+Curtain+On...-a070701621|title=Amazon.com and MGM Home Entertainment Partner to Raise the Curtain On MGM's Legendary Film Vault. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nOn March 3, 2003, MGM Home Entertainment launched the '''MGM Kids''' sub-label.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/mgm-purrs-with-kidvid-label/</ref>.\n\n===Partnerships with [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] (2005-present)===\nIn 2005, following MGM's acquisition by the [[Sony]]-led consortium, MGM started releasing all their new products through [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] under the standard MGM label.\n\nIn 2006, after MGM ended their distribution agreement with Sony, they announced that they would be signing a new distribution deal with [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. Originally, DVD releases of MGM/UA and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] co-releases continued to be distributed by SPHE, since Sony then still owned 20% of MGM, whereas Fox has no controlling interest; however, Fox has since released DVD editions of films based on MGM IPs.

They are academically selective, socially inclusive and very affordable Graduate School of Management within the French Public Research Universities. The IAE model is inspired by the Anglo-Saxon [[Business Schools]].\n\nThere are currently 34 IAEs located all over the French territory, 32 of which are part of the IAE FRANCE network where the oldest members are the first actors in the development of management in France. This is the primary French network of education in [[management]] which has around 45,000 students and 425,000 alumni.\n\n==IAE's History==\n[[File:IAE.gif|thumb|Old IAE logo]]\nThe origin of IAE dates back to the 1950s. At the time, degrees in management were not available in French universities. In the United States, by contrast, economic growth is powered by batches of engineers and managers from the best business schools attached to universities. In the midst of reconstruction, France have a lack of managers while the Thirty Glorious begin.\n\nIn 1955, [[Gaston Berger]], Director of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, created the Institute of Business Administration (IAE) in American style, to provide academic knowledge in management that complements the professional know-how and gather University and Business world.\nIn the beginning, IAE were schools with a single diploma, \u201cCAAE\u201d - Certificate in Business Administration with a pioneering position on the \"dual skills\". This degree was designed to give management skills to engineers and graduate students of the faculties of Law, Letters and Sciences. Recognized degree, designed to be followed on a year, during the evening, is a \u201cMBA \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\u201d. The teaching is based on the case method, innovative approach at the time. It has been for nearly 20 years, the common degree of most IAE in becoming \u201cDESS CAAE\u201d and continues today through the \u201cMAE\u201d (Master of Business Administration).\n\n== Status ==\n\nMost of the IAE have a status of \u00ab institutes and schools belonging to Universities \u00bb, just like the [[University Institutes of Technology]] as an example. Some are part of Faculties such as Faculty of Economics and Management.\n\nThe [[IAE Paris]] is the only independent IAE, it's a [[\u00c9tablissement public \u00e0 caract\u00e8re administratif|public establishment of an administrative nature]] linked to the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]].\n\nThe [[EM Strasbourg Business School]] is the result of the merger between the IAE of Strasbourg and the local business school, It's part of the [[University of Strasbourg]]<ref>{{L\u00e9gifrance|base=CEDU|num\u00e9ro=L713-9|texte=Code de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, article L713-9}}, anciennement article 33 de la loi Savary (il reste d\u2019ailleurs d\u2019usage de surnommer ces \u00e9coles \u00ab article 33 \u00bb)</ref>{{,}}<ref name=d85-1243>{{L\u00e9gifrance|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;tpdjo17v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000690440|texte=D\u00e9cret n\u00b085-1243 du 26 novembre 1985 portant cr\u00e9ation d\u2019instituts et d\u2019\u00e9coles internes dans les universit\u00e9s et les instituts nationaux polytechniques}}</ref>{{,}}<ref>{{L\u00e9gifrance|base=JORF|num\u00e9ro=MENT8902454D |texte=D\u00e9cret {{num\u00e9ro}}59-928 du 21 d\u00e9cembre 1989 relatif \u00e0 l\u2019institut d\u2019administration des entreprises de Paris}}</ref>{{,}}.<ref name=\"NouvEco\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenouveleconomiste.fr/lesdossiers/les-ecoles-universitaires-de-management-16086/|title=Les \u00e9coles universitaires de management|date=26 September 2012|work=www.lenouveleconomiste.fr|author=Laur\u00e8ne Rimondi}}</ref>\n\nThe R\u00e9seau is related to 32 Laboratory of research including 10 [[Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment|Joint Research Units associated]] with the CNRS.\n\n== Admission in IAE ==\n\nThe admission in IAE require the test of the Score IAE-MESSAGE,<ref>http://www.iae-message.fr/</ref> an application file and an admission interview.

They are academically selective, socially inclusive and very affordable Graduate School of Management within the French Public Research Universities. The IAE model is inspired by the Anglo-Saxon [[Business Schools]].\n\nThere are currently 34 IAEs located all over the French territory, 32 of which are part of the IAE FRANCE network where the oldest members are the first actors in the development of management in France. This is the primary French network of education in [[management]] which has around 45,000 students and 425,000 alumni.\n\n==IAE's History==\n[[File:IAE.gif|thumb|Old IAE logo]]\nThe origin of IAE dates back to the 1950s. At the time, degrees in management were not available in French universities. In the United States, by contrast, economic growth is powered by batches of engineers and managers from the best business schools attached to universities. In the midst of reconstruction, France have a lack of managers while the Thirty Glorious begin.\n\nIn 1955, [[Gaston Berger]], Director of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, created the Institute of Business Administration (IAE) in American style, to provide academic knowledge in management that complements the professional know-how and gather University and Business world.\nIn the beginning, IAE were schools with a single diploma, \u201cCAAE\u201d - Certificate in Business Administration with a pioneering position on the \"dual skills\". This degree was designed to give management skills to engineers and graduate students of the faculties of Law, Letters and Sciences. Recognized degree, designed to be followed on a year, during the evening, is a \u201cMBA \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\u201d. The teaching is based on the case method, innovative approach at the time. It has been for nearly 20 years, the common degree of most IAE in becoming \u201cDESS CAAE\u201d and continues today through the \u201cMAE\u201d (Master of Business Administration).\n\n== Status ==\n\nMost of the IAE have a status of \u00ab institutes and schools belonging to Universities \u00bb, just like the [[University Institutes of Technology]] as an example. Some are part of Faculties such as Faculty of Economics and Management.\n\nThe [[IAE Paris]] is the only independent IAE, it's a [[\u00c9tablissement public \u00e0 caract\u00e8re administratif|public establishment of an administrative nature]] linked to the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]].\n\nThe [[EM Strasbourg Business School]] is the result of the merger between the IAE of Strasbourg and the local business school, It's part of the [[University of Strasbourg]]<ref>{{L\u00e9gifrance|base=CEDU|num\u00e9ro=L713-9|texte=Code de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, article L713-9}}, anciennement article 33 de la loi Savary (il reste d\u2019ailleurs d\u2019usage de surnommer ces \u00e9coles \u00ab article 33 \u00bb)</ref>{{,}}<ref name=d85-1243>{{L\u00e9gifrance|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;tpdjo17v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000690440|texte=D\u00e9cret n\u00b085-1243 du 26 novembre 1985 portant cr\u00e9ation d\u2019instituts et d\u2019\u00e9coles internes dans les universit\u00e9s et les instituts nationaux polytechniques}}</ref>{{,}}<ref>{{L\u00e9gifrance|base=JORF|num\u00e9ro=MENT8902454D |texte=D\u00e9cret {{num\u00e9ro}}59-928 du 21 d\u00e9cembre 1989 relatif \u00e0 l\u2019institut d\u2019administration des entreprises de Paris}}</ref>{{,}}.<ref name=\"NouvEco\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenouveleconomiste.fr/lesdossiers/les-ecoles-universitaires-de-management-16086/|title=Les \u00e9coles universitaires de management|date=26 September 2012|work=www.lenouveleconomiste.fr|author=Laur\u00e8ne Rimondi}}</ref>\n\nThe R\u00e9seau is related to 32 Laboratory of research including 10 [[Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment|Joint Research Units associated]] with the CNRS.\n\n== Admission in IAE ==\n\nThe admission in IAE require the test of the Score IAE-MESSAGE,<ref>http://www.iae-message.fr/</ref> an application file and an admission interview.

Its senior leaders are located in several different locations across the world.\n\n== History ==\nHOK was established in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1955. The firm's name is derived from the surnames of its three founding partners: [[George F. Hellmuth]], [[Gyo Obata]] and [[George Kassabaum]], all graduates of the School of Architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. The design firm started with 26 employees and its three founders.\n\nThe practice's first building designs were schools in St. Louis suburbs, and St. Thomas Aquinas High School in [[Florissant, MO|Florissant]] was the first private/parochial school designed by the firm. Another prominent school they designed was the [[Saint Louis Priory School]]. By the mid-1960s, the firm was winning commissions across the [[United States]] and began to open additional offices, starting with [[San Francisco]] in 1966 for the design of a library at Stanford University and Dallas in 1968 for the master planning and design of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Also in 1968, HOK launched its interior design practice. HOK also expanded into Washington, DC, after winning the commission to design the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]]. In 1973, HOK established a presence in New York by acquiring Kahn & Jacobs, designers of many New York City skyscrapers. By the 1970s, the firm was operating internationally and in 1975 the firm was named as architect of the $3.5 billion [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]], at the time the single largest building project in the world. In 1979, George Kassabaum was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician.\n\nIn 1983, HOK formed HOK Sport Venue Event, which became a leader in designing sport stadiums, arenas and convention centers. In January 2009, the Board of HOK Group, Inc. and managers of HOK Sports Facilities, LLC transferred ownership of HOK Sport to leaders of that practice. The company became an independent firm, and rebranded itself as [[Populous (company)|Populous]].\n\nHOK's first office outside the United States opened in [[Hong Kong]] in 1984. In 1987, the firm opened a London office and then, in 1995, expanded this London practice by merging with renowned UK architectural practice Cecil Denny Highton. In November 1994, HOK acquired [[Caudill Rowlett Scott]] based in [[Houston, Texas]], adding offices in Houston and Atlanta. HOK established its first offices in Canada (Toronto and Ottawa) in 1997 with the acquisition of Urbana Architects.\n\nIn 2004, George Hellmuth's nephew, [[William Hellmuth]], was named president of the firm.<ref name=\"bizprofile\">{{cite news| url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/11/17/tidbits10.html?b=1226898000^1734031&page=1 | first=Deborah K. | last=Dietsch | title=HOK's Bill Hellmuth: On top of the world | date=November 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy 2007, international work represented more than 40% of HOK's annual revenue.<ref>Staff (June 23, 2008) \"Uncertain Economy Pushes Design Firms To Diversify Their Portfolios\" ''[[Engineering News-Record]]''</ref>\n\nIn 2008, HOK opened an office in [[Mumbai]], [[India]].

However, there are a variety of common protocols utilized for further observation of viability using assays.\n\n;Tetrazolium reduction: One useful way to locate and measure viability is to complete a Tetrazolium Reduction Assay. The tetrazolium aspect of this assay, which utilizes both positive and negative charges in its formula, promotes the distinction of cell viability in a specimen.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last=Niles |first=Andrew L. |last2=Moravec |first2=Richard A. |last3=Worzella |first3=Tracy J. |last4=Evans |first4=Nathan J. |last5=Riss |first5=Terry L. | name-list-format = vanc |  chapter = High-Throughput Screening Assays for the Assessment of Cytotoxicity |date=2013-03-04 |doi = 10.1002/9781118538203.ch5 | veditors = Steinberg P | title = High-Throughput Screening Methods in Toxicity Testing |pages=107\u2013127 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-53820-3 }}</ref>\n\n;Resazurin reduction: Resazurin Reduction Assays perform very closely to that of a tetrazolium assay, except they use the power of redox to fuel their ability to represent cell viability.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Protease viability marker: One can look at protease fuction in specimens if they wish to target viability in cells; this practice in research is known as \"Protease Viability Marker Assay Concept\". The actions of protease cease once a cell dies, so a clear-cut line is drawn in determining cell viability when using this technique.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;ATP: ATP is a common energy molecule that many researchers carry extensive knowledge about, thus carrying over to how one understands viability assays. The ATP Assay Concept is a well-known technique for determining the viability of cells using the assessment of ATP and a method known as \"firefly luciferase\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Sodium-potassium ratio: Another kind of assay practices the examination of the ratio of [[potassium]] to [[sodium]] in cells to serve as an index of viability. If the cells do not have high intracellular potassium and low intracellular sodium, then (1) the [[cell membrane]] may not be intact, and/or (2) the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]] may not be operating well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindner B, Seydel U | title = Mass spectrometric analysis of drug-induced changes in Na+ and K+ contents of single bacterial cells | journal = Journal of General Microbiology | volume = 129 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u20135 | date = January 1983 | pmid = 6339677 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-129-1-51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichugin Y, Fahy GM, Morin R | title = Cryopreservation of rat hippocampal slices by vitrification | journal = Cryobiology | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 228\u201340 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16403489 | doi = 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.11.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011224005001896 }}</ref> \u00a0\n\n;Cytolysis or membrane leakage: This category includes the [[lactate dehydrogenase]] assay. Assays such as these contain a stable enzyme common in all cells that can be readily detected when cell membranes are no longer intact.

However, there are a variety of common protocols utilized for further observation of viability using assays.\n\n;Tetrazolium reduction: One useful way to locate and measure viability is to complete a Tetrazolium Reduction Assay. The tetrazolium aspect of this assay, which utilizes both positive and negative charges in its formula, promotes the distinction of cell viability in a specimen.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last=Niles |first=Andrew L. |last2=Moravec |first2=Richard A. |last3=Worzella |first3=Tracy J. |last4=Evans |first4=Nathan J. |last5=Riss |first5=Terry L. | name-list-format = vanc |  chapter = High-Throughput Screening Assays for the Assessment of Cytotoxicity |date=2013-03-04 |doi = 10.1002/9781118538203.ch5 | veditors = Steinberg P | title = High-Throughput Screening Methods in Toxicity Testing |pages=107\u2013127 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-53820-3 }}</ref>\n\n;Resazurin reduction: Resazurin Reduction Assays perform very closely to that of a tetrazolium assay, except they use the power of redox to fuel their ability to represent cell viability.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Protease viability marker: One can look at protease fuction in specimens if they wish to target viability in cells; this practice in research is known as \"Protease Viability Marker Assay Concept\". The actions of protease cease once a cell dies, so a clear-cut line is drawn in determining cell viability when using this technique.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;ATP: ATP is a common energy molecule that many researchers carry extensive knowledge about, thus carrying over to how one understands viability assays. The ATP Assay Concept is a well-known technique for determining the viability of cells using the assessment of ATP and a method known as \"firefly luciferase\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Sodium-potassium ratio: Another kind of assay practices the examination of the ratio of [[potassium]] to [[sodium]] in cells to serve as an index of viability.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his mother's second husband. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought on the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather, for example, had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K.

Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]). Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his mother's second husband. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought on the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather, for example, had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake [[William Bonville (died 1408)|Sir William Bonville]], who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings, 4th Baron Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequesthed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nDue to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first. He would, when they married, assign certain estates to her\u2014a ''dos nominata'', or dower\u2014usually a third of everything he was [[seisin|seised]] of. By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner. In 1410 she granted Stucley a life-interest in her inheritance, with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to their children.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} On her death in April 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Stucley thereby gained Devon lands worth around \u00a3105 per annum{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} as well as Wiltshire manors of the Bonville estate, including the valuable manor of [[Chewton Mendip|Chewton]]. Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]]. While in [[Normandy]], sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{refn|It is unknown, however, whether Bonville fought in the Battle of Agincourt itself. The historian [[Clifford J. Rogers]] notes that the numbers known to have begun the campaign had been reduced by early losses, sickness and those otherwise invalided\nto England after the [[Siege of Harfleur]] in particular.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=52}}|group=note}}\n\nIn 1421, Bonville acted as one of the Duke of Clarence's [[executor]]s following the latter's death at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Roskell suggests that Bonville must have been greatly trusted by Clarence\u2014at the time of his death, [[heir presumptive]] to the English throne\u2014because the Duke had borrowed money from Bonville.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville had returned to England before May, when he attended parliament at [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Henry V died in France in August 1422 leaving his six-month-old son [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] as his heir, and his surviving brothers, [[John, Duke of Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] as the baby King's [[regents]].{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|pp=232\u2013233}}{{refn|Clarence had predeceased King Henry, having been killed at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] the previous year.{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|p=218}}|group=note}} The war in France continued in spite of Henry VI's youth, and Bonville returned in 1423 in Gloucester's army. Bonville fought in the campaign to regain [[Le Crotoy]], bringing with him a retinue of ten [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 30 archers.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOn his return to England, much of Bonville's time was occupied with the administration of his estates. Extensive as they were, there was occasional friction\u2014some of it violent\u2014with his neighbours.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1427 he was engaged in a bitter feud with [[Thomas Brooke (died 1439)|Sir Thomas Brooke]], whom Bonville\u2014described as a \"thrusting and able man\"{{Sfn|Wilkinson|1995|p=311}}\u2014accused of unilaterally [[Enclosure|enclosing]] parkland in [[Axmouth]] and obstructing roads that Bonville's tenants needed to use. The matter went to the [[arbitration]] of Bonville's godfather, the Abbot of Newenham, who found against Brooke, who had to pay all Bonville's legal costs and reverse his enclosure.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} By now, Bonville was also a royal official, having been appointed [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1423,{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} although he received few other [[Royal Commission|commissions]] in the county before 1430.{{Refn|Prior to the 1430s, he was only appointed to [[Commission of array|commissions of array]] for [[Dorset]] in April 1418 and March 1419.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}|group=note}} From then on he was regularly occupied with his duties as a royal official in the region: he was a [[justice of the peace]] for Devon from July 1431, for Somerset from March 1435, and for Cornwall from November 1438.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} Other commissions included local inquiries into [[necromancy]], piracy, [[extortion]], [[desertion]] (from the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick's]] fleet in 1438), [[felonies]], smuggling, and [[Concealment of treasure trove|concealment of treasure]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nIn 1437 King Henry VI's minority ended, and he began his personal rule. Bonville was appointed to the [[King's Council]], being described as a \"King's knight\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He was zealous in combating piracy off the Cornish coast, to such an extent that in 1454 the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] made an official complaint to the English government about the treatment meted out to Burgundian shipping in the area.{{sfn|Cherry|1979|p=95}} In 1440 Bonville, with Sir Philip Courtenay\u2014a close friend of Bonville's{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\u2014commanded a small fleet{{Sfn|Barker|2009|p=305}} of thirty [[galley]]s to patrol the [[English Channel|Channel]]. They saw little action; the occasional encounters with the enemy did not necessarily go in their favour, as on one occasion rival Portuguese merchants captured two ships from Bonville's fleet.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n=== Feud with the Earl of Devon ===\n{{See also|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n\n==== 1437\u20131440 ====\nIn 1437, Bonville was appointed [[Steward (office)|Steward]] of the [[Cornwall|county of Cornwall]] for life, for which he received a salary of 40 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] yearly.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} This immediately made him an enemy of the young Earl of Devon, [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]];{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=574\u2013575}} Courtenay's wealth was already reduced by his mother's dower,{{Sfn|Archer|1984|p=26}}{{Refn|Courtenay had been born in 1414, had come of age in 1425, but his mother, Anne Talbot, survived until 1441. During this time she controlled,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} through both her dower and [[jointure]]s, approximately two-thirds of the Courtenay inheritance. Furthermore, she had set up a council to manage the estate. This, says Archer, severely mismanaged it.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=26}}|group=note}} and so granting Bonville the stewardship was not only a blow to the regional hegemony the Courtenays traditionally enjoyed but reduced the earl's income further.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} The stewardship was a significant source of patronage to whoever held it in its own right.{{Sfn|Ross|2011|p=177}} During the Earl's minority, Courtenay influence in Devon waned and shifted towards the county's upper gentry (\"among whom Bonville was pre-eminent\", argues Cherry).{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} The historian [[Hannes Kleineke]] has argued that the minority created a power vacuum in the county which the regional gentry, such as Bonville, had helped fill.

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took\u2014if he took any\u2014on Suffolk's impeachment.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the [[West Country]]. Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]). Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Here the victorious Yorkists again captured King Henry, and Bonville was put in charge of his safe-keeping.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville attended the parliament of November that year which passed the [[Act of Accord]]. This act effectively granted York the throne on Henry's death, and thus disinherited the Prince of Wales. Margaret and her nobles withdrew to the north, where they gathered an army and began to [[pillage]] the [[House of York|Yorkist lords']] estates there. York and the Earl of Salisbury, with their smaller army, marched north the following month; Bonville remained in London. Bonville's son William marched with York, and died with him at the [[Battle of Wakefield]], where the Yorkist army went down to a crushing defeat by the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian army]] on 30 December 1460.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}}\n\n====Second Battle of St Albans====\nThe Lancastrians proceeded to march south; Salisbury's son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], had been left in charge of the King in London.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville, who had been in the southwest raising an army, returned to London.

They encountered each other at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] on 17 February 1461. Bonville\u2014along with [[Sir Thomas Kyriell]]\u2014was placed in charge of the King,{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} whom the Yorkists had brought with them as the (\"nominal\", said the early 20th-century historian C.

As has been said, \"both Bonville and Kyriel were experienced military commanders, and it is unlikely that their role in the battle would have been limited to looking after King Henry\".{{sfn|Burley|Elliott|Watson|2007|p=79}} The story presented by the (Yorkist) chroniclers was that the Prince of Wales, encouraged by Queen Margaret, personally passed Bonville's and Kyriel's death sentences. Supposedly she asked him, \"Fair son, what manner of death shall these knights, whom you see here, die?\", to which the Prince replied, \"Let them have their heads taken off\".

This was the first time in over eight years the members had been seen together at a wrestling event.

Nash was always supposed to return to TNA with Sting after they spent most of 2010 building up the storyline where Sting appeared to be a heel to the public and on television only for the reveal at Bound for Glory that it was really Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff conspiring to steal TNA from Dixie Carter but Sting saw it coming, but nobody would listen. If you recall, in storyline, Nash and The Pope were the other two who found out because they were the two guys doing it with Miss Tessmacher and she spilled the beans. As you can see, the long-term on that sure held together, given that Pope was turned heel for no real reason before Sting and Nash ever started their comeback. While Nash had agreed to come back, while he denied it, months back, he just signed fairly recently when they were ready to bring him back when he and Sting were to return on the 1/31 show. I've heard several different versions about why things went down the way they did. Dixie Carter publicly admitted she released him when asked for reasons she said were between the two of them. Nash told friends that he signed the contract (he got a significant pay cut because TNA said they couldn't afford his old deal), even though he wasn't happy with the money.}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:100%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Incarnation\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Members\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Tenures\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Notes\n|-\n|The Band\n|\n* [[Kevin Nash]] (leader; kicked out on February 4, rejoined on March 21)\n* [[Scott Hall]] (left TNA in June)\n* [[Sean Waltman|Syxx-Pac]] (left TNA in June)\n* [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] (joined on May 3, left on June 24)\n* [[Bubba the Love Sponge|Bubba]] (personal interviewer; joined in late March, fired from TNA on April 30)\n* [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] (joined on August 5)\n* [[Elijah Burke|D'Angelo Dinero]] (joined on September 16)\n|January 4, 2010 \u2013 June 24, 2010<br>August 5, 2010 - October 14, 2010\n|}\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n* '''[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'''\n** [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] ([[List of TNA World Tag Team Champions#Title history|1 time]]) \u2013 [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]], Kevin Nash and Scott Hall (1)<sup>1</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup> <small>During their reign, Hall and Nash invoked [[The Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|\"The Band Rules\"]] and named Eric Young as a co-champion.</small>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/band.html Online World of Wrestling]\n\n{{TNA World Tag Team Championship}}\n{{New World Order}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Band, The}}\n[[Category:Impact Wrestling teams and stables]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Professional wrestling stable}}\n{{Infobox wrestling team\n|article_name = The Band\n|type         = S\n|image        = TheBandTNA.jpg\n|caption      = \n|members      = ''[[#Members|See below]]''\n|names        = The Band\n|debut        = January 4, 2010\n|disbanded    = October 10, 2010\n|years_active = 2010\n|promotions   = [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]]\n}}\n\n'''The Band''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]] which competed in [[Total Nonstop Action]] (TNA) Wrestling in 2010.

This was the first time in over eight years the members had been seen together at a wrestling event.

Nash was always supposed to return to TNA with Sting after they spent most of 2010 building up the storyline where Sting appeared to be a heel to the public and on television only for the reveal at Bound for Glory that it was really Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff conspiring to steal TNA from Dixie Carter but Sting saw it coming, but nobody would listen. If you recall, in storyline, Nash and The Pope were the other two who found out because they were the two guys doing it with Miss Tessmacher and she spilled the beans. As you can see, the long-term on that sure held together, given that Pope was turned heel for no real reason before Sting and Nash ever started their comeback. While Nash had agreed to come back, while he denied it, months back, he just signed fairly recently when they were ready to bring him back when he and Sting were to return on the 1/31 show. I've heard several different versions about why things went down the way they did. Dixie Carter publicly admitted she released him when asked for reasons she said were between the two of them. Nash told friends that he signed the contract (he got a significant pay cut because TNA said they couldn't afford his old deal), even though he wasn't happy with the money.}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:100%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Incarnation\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Members\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Tenures\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Notes\n|-\n|The Band\n|\n* [[Kevin Nash]] (leader; kicked out on February 4, rejoined on March 21)\n* [[Scott Hall]] (left TNA in June)\n* [[Sean Waltman|Syxx-Pac]] (left TNA in June)\n* [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] (joined on May 3, left on June 24)\n* [[Bubba the Love Sponge|Bubba]] (personal interviewer; joined in late March, fired from TNA on April 30)\n* [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] (joined on August 5)\n* [[Elijah Burke|D'Angelo Dinero]] (joined on September 16)\n|January 4, 2010 \u2013 June 24, 2010<br>August 5, 2010 - October 14, 2010\n|}\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n* '''[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'''\n** [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] ([[List of TNA World Tag Team Champions#Title history|1 time]]) \u2013 [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]], Kevin Nash and Scott Hall (1)<sup>1</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup> <small>During their reign, Hall and Nash invoked [[The Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|\"The Band Rules\"]] and named Eric Young as a co-champion.</small>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/band.html Online World of Wrestling]\n\n{{TNA World Tag Team Championship}}\n{{New World Order}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Band, The}}\n[[Category:Impact Wrestling teams and stables]]\n", "name_user": "2601:88:8100:a1a0:6cac:ed7d:f2d0:6576", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band_(professional_wrestling)"}
