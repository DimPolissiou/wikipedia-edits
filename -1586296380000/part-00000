Frenkel asked his former co-worker, Askerova (who owned a restaurant at the time), to get him in touch with somebody who can kill Kozlov, and she found more intermediaries in Pogorzhevsky and Shafrai, who, in turn, found the shooters - Proglyada and Polovinkin. Frenkel paid $310,000 to Askerova, out of which $200,000 went to Pogorzhevsky, $90,000 to Askerova and only $20,000 to the shooters themselves.

Rob and Amber were welcomed very nicely; John Vito and Jill said they were a strong team. Later, they guessed that the next elimination would be Eric & Danielle.\n*Leg 5 was a non-elimination leg. The four eliminated teams sat around waiting for another team, only to hear John Vito and Kevin figure out that it must be a non-elimination leg. They spent time on a beach overlook; back at the villa, Rob dragged Mary into the pool.\n*After Leg 6, Teri & Ian were the fifth team eliminated and sent to the villa. Drew put on a displeased face for the camera when they arrived. A disgruntled Ian revealed that he believed Oswald & Danny are ruthless racers with no character, saying that when he worked with them in [[Ushuaia]] to book flights, they deliberately booked him a different flight and did not confirm it. He said that the same thing happened when Eric & Danielle worked with Oswald and Danny. He also predicted that either Dustin & Kandice or Uchenna & Joyce would win.\n*Leg 7 was a non-elimination leg. John Vito and Jill pondered about this non-elimination round. Ian expressed how he and Teri bonded with Joe & Bill and Eric & Danielle as a result of their spending consecutive days together in airports. Amber did tattoos for entertainment.\n*After Leg 8, Joe & Bill were the sixth team eliminated. The eliminated teams got a call from them and were sad to hear that Joe & Bill were eliminated from the ''Race''. Mary asked Joe & Bill who they think should win. Bill said that he would love to see Uchenna & Joyce or Charla & Mirna win. The guests talked about the call the next morning. In a confessional, Kevin and Drew said that since they were so close to the Finish Line, they would see Joe & Bill where the ''Race'' finishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/interview-joe-baldassare-and-bill-bartek-dish-on-all-stars-adventure-4944.php|title=INTERVIEW: Joe Baldassare and Bill Bartek dish on ''All-Stars'' adventure|accessdate=April 2, 2007}}</ref>\n*After Leg 9, Uchenna & Joyce were the seventh team eliminated. They called the villa and told the eliminated teams about their flight problem that led to their elimination. The teams at the villa expressed disappointment at Uchenna & Joyce's elimination, and Amber tells them they would meet up at the Finish Line. Prior to the call, Drew questioned why Dustin & Kandice need to participate in the ''Race'' when they had already won beauty pageants. Amber took exception to this, having won ''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'' prior to her original season of ''The Amazing Race''.\n*Leg 10 was a non-elimination leg. The eliminated teams waited for another team, only to discover that the leg was non-elimination. Amber taught Mary how to swim, allowing her to overcome her long-held fear of swimming.\n*Leg 11 was a non-elimination leg. The eliminated teams waited for a phone call from the next eliminated team, but give up after several days. John Vito came up with the idea of throwing an awards party to commemorate the end of their stay at the villa. Each racer drew another racer's name and presented him or her with funny and sometimes touching gifts.\n*After Leg 12, Oswald & Danny were the eighth and final team eliminated. The five teams at the villa departed for the \"end city\" in order to cheer the remaining teams at the finish line. They reunited with Joe & Bill, Uchenna & Joyce, and newly eliminated Oswald & Danny. Oswald and Danny said they would like to see Charla & Mirna win the ''Race'', while some of the other teams reiterated who they would like to see win.\n*Leg 13 was the final leg of ''The Amazing Race: All-Stars''. Some of the eliminated teams shared their opinions on the winners and the runners-up. The final three admitted to their joys and disappointments.\n\n==Race summary==\n[[Image:The Amazing Race 11 map.png|thumb|right|240px|Route map]]\n{{TAR Captionbox|Style2}}\n\n===Leg 1 (United States \u2192 Ecuador)===\n[[File:Cotopaxi volcano 2008-06-27T1322.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cotopaxi]] volcano in [[Ecuador]] was the locale of the Detour and the Pit Stop of the first leg.]]\n'''Airdate''': February 18, 2007\n*[[Palmetto Bay, Florida|Palmetto Bay]], [[Florida]] {{flagicon|Florida}}, '''[[United States]]''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Charles Deering Estate|Charles Deering Historic Estate]]) (Starting Line)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] ([[Miami International Airport]]) to [[Quito]], '''[[Ecuador]]''' {{flagicon|ECU}} ([[Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport|Mariscal Sucre International Airport]])\n*Quito ([[Plaza de San Francisco, Quito|Plaza de San Francisco]])\n*Quito ([http://www.restaurantepims.com/ Pim's Restaurant]) (Overnight Rest)\n*[[Napo Province]] ([[Cotopaxi National Park]] \u2013 [http://www.haciendayanahurco.com/ Hacienda Yanahurco]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Wrangle It|Recover It}}\n*Napo Province (Cotopaxi National Park \u2013 Mirador Cotopaxi) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|1}}\n\nThe first Detour was a choice between Wrangle It or Recover It. In Wrangle It, teams had to help local cowboys lasso, tie down, and groom one wild horse, which had grown hooves too long to walk properly. Team members had to use traditional tools to clip its hooves to a safe length and to trim its mane and tail. When the horse was released, teams would receive their next clue.

Teams needed to figure out that the majority of the letters, when unscrambled, would spell one of the ten destinations inscribed on the plaques hanging on the wall. When they believed they had the solution, which was \"[[Chuquicamata]]\", they had to show their answer to the security guard. If they were correct, he would hand them their next clue.\n\nThe Detour was a choice of By Hand or By Machine. In By Hand, teams had to choose a two-ton tire and, by properly aligning the bolts and washers, finish securing it to a dump truck. When the work was complete, a foreman would hand them the next clue. In By Machine, each team member had to take a turn driving a huge [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]] to transfer gravel. When teams moved enough gravel to cover a marked yellow line on a stick, a foreman would hand them the next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*After the Detour, teams had to drive themselves in a marked vehicle to the Pit Stop at the Valley of the Dead in [[San Pedro de Atacama]].

They then had to build a traditional local signpost listing in order the fourteen ports-of-call on his voyage. While the signs didn't have to point in the right direction, all the cities had to be spelled correctly. When they completed the signpost, they would receive their next clue.\n\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member was to search through 1,600 pieces of mail from a mailbag to find one of two letters addressed to their team (written by one of the other teams from their season). The team member then had to read the message inside the letter to their partner, after which they received their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*Upon arrival in Punta Arenas, teams had to find the ''Lord Lonsdale'' shipwreck and locate the clue nearby.\n*At Carlos Ibanez Del Campo International Airport, teams had to sign-up for one of two charter flights to [[Ushuaia]], [[Argentina]], known as one of [[The southernmost settlements in the world|the southernmost cities in the world]], which departed at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 11:00&nbsp;a.m. the following morning.\n*At Bahia Lapataia, teams had to take a number for a place on a boat to Isla Redonda.

Subsequently, eliminated teams telephoned the villa to inform those teams at the villa of their elimination, but continued to run the ''Race'' as decoys to throw off spoilers to the final outcome of the ''Race''. The sequestered teams met with the decoy teams in the final destination city to cheer on the final three teams as they crossed the Finish Line.\n\nCBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific time zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa.\n*After Leg 1, John Vito & Jill were the first eliminated and sent to the villa. While there, they were guessing who would be eliminated next. They thought it would either be Charla & Mirna or Kevin & Drew.\n*After Leg 2, Kevin & Drew were the second team eliminated and sent to the villa. While there, Kevin, Drew, and John Vito were arguing over what a [[Stoop (architecture)|stoop]] was. Later, they guessed Charla & Mirna would be eliminated next.\n*After Leg 3, David & Mary were the third team eliminated and sent to the villa. David recounted over breakfast how he was misdirected by several [[Chile]]an locals. Later, Jill shows David & Mary the master [[suite (address)|suite]] they saved for the first married couple. Later, Drew guessed Teri & Ian might be eliminated next.\n*After Leg 4, Rob & Amber became the fourth team eliminated and sent to the villa. Rob and Amber were welcomed very nicely; John Vito and Jill said they were a strong team. Later, they guessed that the next elimination would be Eric & Danielle.\n*Leg 5 was a non-elimination leg. The four eliminated teams sat around waiting for another team, only to hear John Vito and Kevin figure out that it must be a non-elimination leg. They spent time on a beach overlook; back at the villa, Rob dragged Mary into the pool.\n*After Leg 6, Teri & Ian were the fifth team eliminated and sent to the villa. Drew put on a displeased face for the camera when they arrived. A disgruntled Ian revealed that he believed Oswald & Danny are ruthless racers with no character, saying that when he worked with them in [[Ushuaia]] to book flights, they deliberately booked him a different flight and did not confirm it. He said that the same thing happened when Eric & Danielle worked with Oswald and Danny. He also predicted that either Dustin & Kandice or Uchenna & Joyce would win.\n*Leg 7 was a non-elimination leg. John Vito and Jill pondered about this non-elimination round. Ian expressed how he and Teri bonded with Joe & Bill and Eric & Danielle as a result of their spending consecutive days together in airports. Amber did tattoos for entertainment.\n*After Leg 8, Joe & Bill were the sixth team eliminated. The eliminated teams got a call from them and were sad to hear that Joe & Bill were eliminated from the ''Race''. Mary asked Joe & Bill who they think should win. Bill said that he would love to see Uchenna & Joyce or Charla & Mirna win. The guests talked about the call the next morning. In a confessional, Kevin and Drew said that since they were so close to the Finish Line, they would see Joe & Bill where the ''Race'' finishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/interview-joe-baldassare-and-bill-bartek-dish-on-all-stars-adventure-4944.php|title=INTERVIEW: Joe Baldassare and Bill Bartek dish on ''All-Stars'' adventure|accessdate=April 2, 2007}}</ref>\n*After Leg 9, Uchenna & Joyce were the seventh team eliminated. They called the villa and told the eliminated teams about their flight problem that led to their elimination. The teams at the villa expressed disappointment at Uchenna & Joyce's elimination, and Amber tells them they would meet up at the Finish Line. Prior to the call, Drew questioned why Dustin & Kandice need to participate in the ''Race'' when they had already won beauty pageants. Amber took exception to this, having won ''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'' prior to her original season of ''The Amazing Race''.\n*Leg 10 was a non-elimination leg. The eliminated teams waited for another team, only to discover that the leg was non-elimination. Amber taught Mary how to swim, allowing her to overcome her long-held fear of swimming.\n*Leg 11 was a non-elimination leg. The eliminated teams waited for a phone call from the next eliminated team, but give up after several days. John Vito came up with the idea of throwing an awards party to commemorate the end of their stay at the villa. Each racer drew another racer's name and presented him or her with funny and sometimes touching gifts.\n*After Leg 12, Oswald & Danny were the eighth and final team eliminated. The five teams at the villa departed for the \"end city\" in order to cheer the remaining teams at the finish line. They reunited with Joe & Bill, Uchenna & Joyce, and newly eliminated Oswald & Danny. Oswald and Danny said they would like to see Charla & Mirna win the ''Race'', while some of the other teams reiterated who they would like to see win.\n*Leg 13 was the final leg of ''The Amazing Race: All-Stars''. Some of the eliminated teams shared their opinions on the winners and the runners-up. The final three admitted to their joys and disappointments.\n\n==Race summary==\n[[Image:The Amazing Race 11 map.png|thumb|right|240px|Route map]]\n{{TAR Captionbox|Style2}}\n\n===Leg 1 (United States \u2192 Ecuador)===\n[[File:Cotopaxi volcano 2008-06-27T1322.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cotopaxi]] volcano in [[Ecuador]] was the locale of the Detour and the Pit Stop of the first leg.]]\n'''Airdate''': February 18, 2007\n*[[Palmetto Bay, Florida|Palmetto Bay]], [[Florida]] {{flagicon|Florida}}, '''[[United States]]''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Charles Deering Estate|Charles Deering Historic Estate]]) (Starting Line)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] ([[Miami International Airport]]) to [[Quito]], '''[[Ecuador]]''' {{flagicon|ECU}} ([[Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport|Mariscal Sucre International Airport]])\n*Quito ([[Plaza de San Francisco, Quito|Plaza de San Francisco]])\n*Quito ([http://www.restaurantepims.com/ Pim's Restaurant]) (Overnight Rest)\n*[[Napo Province]] ([[Cotopaxi National Park]] \u2013 [http://www.haciendayanahurco.com/ Hacienda Yanahurco]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Wrangle It|Recover It}}\n*Napo Province (Cotopaxi National Park \u2013 Mirador Cotopaxi) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|1}}\n\nThe first Detour was a choice between Wrangle It or Recover It. In Wrangle It, teams had to help local cowboys lasso, tie down, and groom one wild horse, which had grown hooves too long to walk properly. Team members had to use traditional tools to clip its hooves to a safe length and to trim its mane and tail. When the horse was released, teams would receive their next clue. In Recover It, one team member had to put on an historical military uniform. Then, teams had to search a field for three items missing from the uniform, an [[epaulette]], a button, and a sword, to receive their next clue from a general.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the start of the ''Race'', teams were instructed to travel to their first destination city: [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Teams had had to pick a marked [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicle to drive to [[Miami International Airport]] to book one of two flights. Five teams would be on an [[American Airlines]] flight which departed second but arrived first, while the other six teams would be [[Copa Airlines]] which departed first and arrived two hours behind the leaders.\n*At Pim's Restaurant, teams had to pull a number for one of three different departure times for the next morning: 7:00, 7:15 and 7:30&nbsp;a.m. At the designated times, teams were provided a map and found cars to drive themselves to Hacienda Yanahurco at [[Cotopaxi National Park]], advised to enter at the north park entrance.\n\n===Leg 2 (Ecuador \u2192 Chile)===\n[[Image:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Detour in Chile took place at [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine.

Teams needed to figure out that the majority of the letters, when unscrambled, would spell one of the ten destinations inscribed on the plaques hanging on the wall. When they believed they had the solution, which was \"[[Chuquicamata]]\", they had to show their answer to the security guard. If they were correct, he would hand them their next clue.\n\nThe Detour was a choice of By Hand or By Machine. In By Hand, teams had to choose a two-ton tire and, by properly aligning the bolts and washers, finish securing it to a dump truck. When the work was complete, a foreman would hand them the next clue. In By Machine, each team member had to take a turn driving a huge [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]] to transfer gravel. When teams moved enough gravel to cover a marked yellow line on a stick, a foreman would hand them the next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*After the Detour, teams had to drive themselves in a marked vehicle to the Pit Stop at the Valley of the Dead in [[San Pedro de Atacama]]. Teams had to heed a speed limit of {{convert|40|km/h|0}} while driving through [[Valle de la Luna (Chile)|Valle de la Luna]] on their way to the Pit Stop and could increase their speed to {{convert|50|km/h|0}} after leaving the valley.\n\n===Leg 3 (Chile)===\n[[File:Petrohue river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Petrohu\u00e9 River]] in Chile's [[Los Lagos Region]] was the site of this leg's Detour.]]\n'''Airdate''': March 4, 2007\n*San Pedro de Atacama (Iglesia de San Pedro de Atacama)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Calama (El Loa Airport) to [[Puerto Montt]] ([[El Tepual Airport]])\n*Metri ([[University of Los Lagos|Universidad de Los Lagos]] \u2013 Centro Acuicultura y Ciencias del Mar) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who can handle a slippery situation?}}\n*[[Vicente P\u00e9rez Rosales National Park]] ([[Petrohu\u00e9 River]] \u2013 La Maquina) {{TAR clue|Detour|Vertical Limit|River Wild}}\n*Vicente P\u00e9rez Rosales National Park (Playa Petrohu\u00e9) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|3}}\n\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to choose an {{convert|1800|gal|adj=on}} fish-breeding tank, jump in, and catch and transfer all 80 [[flounder]] from the breeding tank to a holding tank at the other end of the farm. Once finished, their clue would be revealed at the bottom of the tank.\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Vertical Limit or River Wild. In Vertical Limit, teams had to walk {{convert|200|yd|m|0}} to a cliff where both team members needed to complete a {{convert|40|ft|m|0|adj=on}} rock climb. Each team member would grab half of their clue at the top. In River Wild, teams had to backtrack {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} to the banks of Rio Petrohu\u00e9, where they would complete a two-and-a-half mile (4&nbsp;km) whitewater-rafting course, through [[International Scale of River Difficulty|level 3 and 4]] [[rapids]]. After completing the course, teams would find their next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*Upon arrival in Puerto Montt, teams had to choose a marked vehicle to drive themselves to the town of Metri.\n\n===Leg 4 (Chile \u2192 Argentina)===\n[[File:Ushuaia from the bay.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Ushuaia]], [[Argentina]], one of [[The southernmost settlements in the world|the southernmost cities in the world]], was visited by teams on this leg.]]\n'''Airdate''': March 11, 2007\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Puerto Montt (El Tepual Airport) to [[Punta Arenas]] ([[Presidente Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo International Airport]])\n*Punta Arenas (''Lord Lonsdale'' Shipwreck)\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Navigate It|Sign It}} Punta Arenas ([http://www.lonelyplanet.com/chile/southern-patagonia/punta-arenas/sights/square-plaza/plaza-munoz-gamero Plaza Mu\u00f1oz Gamero] and [http://nautilus.cl/ Nautilus] ''or'' Plaza)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Punta Arenas (Presidente Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo International Airport) to [[Ushuaia]], [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]], '''[[Argentina]]''' {{flagicon|ARG}} ([[Ushuaia \u2013 Malvinas Argentinas International Airport|Ushuaia International Airport]])\n*Ushuaia (Playa Larga)\n*{{TAR travel|ferry}} Ushuaia ([[Tierra del Fuego National Park|Bahia Lapataia]]) to [[:es:Isla Redonda (canal Beagle)|Isla Redonda]] {{in lang|es}} (Unidad Postal Fin del Mundo Post Office) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's good at sorting things out?}}\n*Isla Redonda (M\u00e1stil de Crucero [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|4}}\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Navigate It or Sign It. In Navigate It, teams had to use a map of Punta Arenas to find the Plaza Mu\u00f1oz Gamero, where a sailor would hand them a compass. Then, using the compass, the teams needed to walk directly south to the Nautilus Building, a deep-sea salvage business, where a provider would give their next clue. In Sign It, teams had to choose a pole and building supplies and carry them up a flight of stairs to [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s map. Using this map as a reference, teams needed to determine [[Magellan's circumnavigation|his expedition's circumnavigation of the world began and ended]] in [[Seville]]. They then had to build a traditional local signpost listing in order the fourteen ports-of-call on his voyage. While the signs didn't have to point in the right direction, all the cities had to be spelled correctly.

The other team member then had 10&nbsp;minutes to guess his or her teammate's answers, entering the same code to unlock the safe. If they guessed correctly, the safe would open and they could retrieve their final clue. If the 10 minutes expired without a correct guess, a guard would hand them their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n===Canadian ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Order\n! Episode\n!

Deepak's senior realizes that he is far too innocent and does various favours for him in order to gain his trust to loot the security agency. Deepak is extremely against the theft when the senior first mentions it. Then the senior blackmails him saying that a previously stolen box is currently kept in Deepak's house. Feeling cornered, Deepak agrees to the risky plan of stealing the keys for this box when suddenly they are both robbed again and the senior is killed. Meanwhile, Rakhi loses her job tragically. Deepak finds the box stolen by his senior in his house and comes up with a plan to ensure Rakhi and Mahi's safe return to their village.\n\nThe movie ends when his attempt to steal the keys from the agency cost him his life but through a shrewd tactic he is able to pass on Rakhi the key for the stolen box.

It places huge pressure on the environment, causing problems such as erosion and flooding, which in turn leads to low agricultural productivity.\n\nThe causes of urban poverty are due to the limited employment opportunities, degraded environment, bad housing and sanitation. The urban poor hold jobs that are labour demanding, thus affecting their health conditions. Therefore, the urban poor are in a difficult situation to escape poverty.<ref name=\"jica.go.jp\">Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

Also, they tend to depend solely or largely on crop cultivation and fisheries for their livelihood and thus are harder hit by floods relative to their income.\n\nImportant to the finances of farmers operating small farms is their self-sufficiency in rice and floods adversely affect this factor, destroying harvests and arable land.

In areas hard hit by floods, especially disaster floods such as the 1988 flood, several researchers have found that many of the affected households have resorted to selling off assets such as land and livestock to mitigate losses.<ref>Haque,C.E., & Zaman, M.Q.

The main reason cited had been lack of financial resources although it was found that many of these people are willing to substitute non-financial means of payment such as labour, harvest or part of their land<ref name=orretal/>\n \nThe above is problematic as it creates a vicious cycle for the poor of Bangladesh. Because the poor may not be able to afford safer housing, they have to live near the river which raises their risk of flooding. This would result in greater damage suffered from the floods, driving the poor into selling assets and pushing them further into poverty. They would be further deprived of sufficient resources needed to prevent extensive damage from flooding, resulting in even more flood damage and poverty. It then becomes even harder to escape this cycle. Even those farmers slightly above the poverty line are but just one bad flood away from the ranks of the poor.\n\n== Implications of poverty in Bangladesh ==\nThe [[Gross national income]] (GNI) per capita measured in 2008 prices is a staggering low of US$520 while GNI Purchasing Power Parity per capita is US$1440 (2008).<ref>Bangladesh \u2013 facts at a glance \u2013 CIDA,http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/JUD-31105911-LRJ, Retrieved 10 March 2011</ref> This is a dismal figure when compared to other developed economies. Even though the poverty rate in Bangladesh has been decreasing, it is doing so at a slow rate of less than 2% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mujeri |first=Mustafa, K. |date=Winter 2000 |title=Poverty Trends and Growth Performance: Some Issues in Bangladesh |journal=The Pakistan Development Review |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=1171\u20131191 |jstor=41260319|doi=10.30541/v39i4IIpp.1171-1191 }}</ref> Poverty matters because it affects many factors of growth \u2013 education, population growth rates, health of the workforce and public policy. Poverty is most concentrated in the rural areas of Bangladesh, hence creating disparities between the rural and urban areas. However, urban poverty remains a problem too.\n\nIn particular, poverty has been linked strongly to education and employment. Research papers published by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) have shown that poverty acts as both a cause and effect of a lack of education, which in turn adversely affects employment opportunities. Having an unskilled workforce also greatly decreases the productivity of the workforce which decreases the appeal of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) and thus impedes sustainable economic growth. In essence, education is an important contribution to the social and economic development of a country.\n\nSecondly, rising landlessness is also a consequence of poverty in Bangladesh. In the year 2000, among the poorest of the poor \u2013 the poorest 20 percent of the population \u2013 four out of five owned less than half an acre of land. Not only did many own no acreage at all, but landlessness has been increasing in rural Bangladesh along with the number of small and marginal farms.<ref>World Bank. 2002. Report No. 24299-BD: Poverty in Bangladesh: Building on Progress Paper prepared by Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Sector Unit South Asia Region, World Bank Document</ref> The 2000 HIES found nearly half (48 percent) of the country's rural population to be effectively landless, owning at most 0.05 acres. Roughly three-fifths of all households in the two poorest quintiles fell into that category.\n\nLastly, for the chronic poor, issues such as food security and health hamper social mobility. According to a study done by the World Bank on Dhaka, the poor suffers from a lack of proper healthcare in their areas due to the expensive and poor quality health care services.<ref>World Bank. \"The Challenges Of Service Delivery for Dhaka\u2019s\"www.worldbank.org. World Bank, n.d.Web.3 Mar.2011.<http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BANGLADESHEXTN/Resources/2957591182963268987/ch4.pdf>, Retrieved 10 March 2011</ref> The poverty stricken areas either do not have the available facilities, or can only afford low quality healthcare. This is a problem that is common in both the rural and urban poor. For the urban poor, the problem has worsened as they can only afford to stay in slums where there are problems of overcrowding and unhygienic living conditions. These two factors results in the spread of diseases amongst the poor whom cannot afford better healthcare. Also, one cannot deny that a healthy and well-fed citizen is better suited for increased productivity as part of the workforce.

It places huge pressure on the environment, causing problems such as erosion and flooding, which in turn leads to low agricultural productivity.\n\nThe causes of urban poverty are due to the limited employment opportunities, degraded environment, bad housing and sanitation. The urban poor hold jobs that are labour demanding, thus affecting their health conditions.

In areas hard hit by floods, especially disaster floods such as the 1988 flood, several researchers have found that many of the affected households have resorted to selling off assets such as land and livestock to mitigate losses.<ref>Haque,C.E., & Zaman, M.Q.

The main reason cited had been lack of financial resources although it was found that many of these people are willing to substitute non-financial means of payment such as labour, harvest or part of their land<ref name=orretal/>\n \nThe above is problematic as it creates a vicious cycle for the poor of Bangladesh. Because the poor may not be able to afford safer housing, they have to live near the river which raises their risk of flooding. This would result in greater damage suffered from the floods, driving the poor into selling assets and pushing them further into poverty. They would be further deprived of sufficient resources needed to prevent extensive damage from flooding, resulting in even more flood damage and poverty. It then becomes even harder to escape this cycle. Even those farmers slightly above the poverty line are but just one bad flood away from the ranks of the poor.\n\n== Implications of poverty in Bangladesh ==\nThe [[Gross national income]] (GNI) per capita measured in 2008 prices is a staggering low of US$520 while GNI Purchasing Power Parity per capita is US$1440 (2008).<ref>Bangladesh \u2013 facts at a glance \u2013 CIDA,http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/JUD-31105911-LRJ, Retrieved 10 March 2011</ref> This is a dismal figure when compared to other developed economies.

Poverty is most concentrated in the rural areas of Bangladesh, hence creating disparities between the rural and urban areas. However, urban poverty remains a problem too.\n\nIn particular, poverty has been linked strongly to education and employment. Research papers published by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) have shown that poverty acts as both a cause and effect of a lack of education, which in turn adversely affects employment opportunities. Having an unskilled workforce also greatly decreases the productivity of the workforce which decreases the appeal of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) and thus impedes sustainable economic growth. In essence, education is an important contribution to the social and economic development of a country.\n\nSecondly, rising landlessness is also a consequence of poverty in Bangladesh. In the year 2000, among the poorest of the poor \u2013 the poorest 20 percent of the population \u2013 four out of five owned less than half an acre of land. Not only did many own no acreage at all, but landlessness has been increasing in rural Bangladesh along with the number of small and marginal farms.<ref>World Bank. 2002. Report No. 24299-BD: Poverty in Bangladesh: Building on Progress Paper prepared by Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Sector Unit South Asia Region, World Bank Document</ref> The 2000 HIES found nearly half (48 percent) of the country's rural population to be effectively landless, owning at most 0.05 acres. Roughly three-fifths of all households in the two poorest quintiles fell into that category.\n\nLastly, for the chronic poor, issues such as food security and health hamper social mobility. According to a study done by the World Bank on Dhaka, the poor suffers from a lack of proper healthcare in their areas due to the expensive and poor quality health care services.<ref>World Bank. \"The Challenges Of Service Delivery for Dhaka\u2019s\"www.worldbank.org. World Bank, n.d.Web.3 Mar.2011.<http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BANGLADESHEXTN/Resources/2957591182963268987/ch4.pdf>, Retrieved 10 March 2011</ref> The poverty stricken areas either do not have the available facilities, or can only afford low quality healthcare. This is a problem that is common in both the rural and urban poor. For the urban poor, the problem has worsened as they can only afford to stay in slums where there are problems of overcrowding and unhygienic living conditions. These two factors results in the spread of diseases amongst the poor whom cannot afford better healthcare. Also, one cannot deny that a healthy and well-fed citizen is better suited for increased productivity as part of the workforce. Thus, poverty matters because it consequences the social welfare of citizens.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bangladesh]]\n*[[Economy of Bangladesh]]\n*[[List of companies of Bangladesh]]\n*[[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]]\n*[[Electricity sector in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Automotive industry in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Bangladeshi RMG Sector]]\n*[[Natural gas in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Steel industry in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Bangladesh textile industry]]\n*[[Leather industry in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Executive Magistrate of Bangladesh]]\n*[[Index of Bangladesh-related articles]]\n*[[Outline of Bangladesh]]\n*[[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Foreign relations of Bangladesh]]\n*[[Tourism in Bangladesh]]\n*[[Dhaka Stock Exchange]]\n*[[Chittagong Stock Exchange]]\n*[[3G (countries)]]\n*[[List of slums in Bangladesh]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Bangladesh topics}}\n{{Asia topic|Poverty in}}\n\n[[Category:Poverty in Bangladesh| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: between 2010 to \u2192 between 2010 and, a alarming \u2192 an alarming", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_Bangladesh"}

''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', in May 2008, rated \"The Launch of Image Comics\" as #1 in the list of events that rocked the Comic Industry from 1991 to 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Rossen| first = Jake| title = 50 Events That Rocked Comics| journal = Wizard Magazine #200| date = May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first issue of ''Spawn'' was very popular with sales of 1.7 million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spawn.com/info/todd/bio.long.aspx |title=Todd McFarlane \u2013 Complete Biography |publisher=Spawn.com |accessdate=2008-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921213405/http://spawn.com/info/todd/bio.long.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-21 }}</ref> During ''Spawn'''s second year of publication, ''Wizard'' noted that \"The top dog at Image is undoubtedly Todd McFarlane's ''Spawn'', which, without the added marketing push of fancy covers, polybagged issues, or card inserts has become the best-selling comic on a consistent basis that is currently being published.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = | first= | date = June 1993 | title = Wizard Market Watch | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 22 | pages = 134\u20135}}</ref> Sales slumped around the time of ''Spawn'' #25, but by ''Spawn'' #45 it was again a consistently strong seller.<ref name=\"WizScorching\">{{cite news | last = Pearson | first= Lars | date = August 1997 | title = Spawn's Scorching | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 141}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of the franchise peaked with the 1997 [[Spawn (1997 film)|''Spawn'' feature film]], the pre-release publicity for which helped make ''Spawn'' the top selling comic book for May 1997;<ref name=\"WizScorching\"/> in addition, the spin-off ''Curse of the Spawn'' #9 came in at fifth best-selling for the same month.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first= | date = August 1997 | title = Wizard Top 100 | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 142}}</ref> However, the film was only a mild commercial success and failed to start a film franchise based on the character.

He is the second eldest of three children (Marc, Albert, and Richard) born to Bernard Simmons- a traveling salesman- and Esther Simmons- a devil worshipper. Simmons is a highly intelligent and physically strong [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He later joins the [[United States Secret Service]] and becomes a highly decorated member. This leads to his recruitment to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Once in the CIA, Simmons joins the U.S. Security Group- an umbrella agency encompassing the [[CIA]], the [[NSA]], and the [[National Security Council|NSC]]- commanded by Director [[Jason Wynn]], and becomes a highly capable assassin.\n\nAfter being murdered during a mission in [[Botswana]] when Director Wynn hires Simmons' friend and partner, Bruce Stinson (codename [[Chapel (comics)|Chapel]]), to kill him, Simmons is sent to [[Hell]] due to his life as an assassin.<ref name=\"Nelson2012\">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Victoria|title=Gothicka: Vampire Heroes, Human Gods, and the New Supernatural|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeTmjxcT0g8C&pg=PT103|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-06540-6|pages=103\u2013104}}</ref><ref name=booker>{{cite book|editor=M.

With only vague recollections of his past and how he came to be, he only knew his name, 'Al Simmons,' and that he died, but nothing else.\n\nOccasionally experiencing painful flashbacks, he eventually remembers his deal with Malebolgia, but can't remember his wife's name in order to return to her. \n\nUsing CIA files, he tracks down his wife to find her married to his former best friend, Terry, with a daughter named Cyan,<ref name=booker/> and realizes that five years have passed since his death.\n\nSpawn soon runs into a fellow Hellspawn who informs him that his powers are fueled by [[Necroplasm]], and once they are fully depleted, he will return to Hell.\n\nNot wanting to return to Hell, Spawn attempts to find a new purpose in life, while using as little power as possible. Spawn is thrust into several [[antihero]] adventures where he takes down street gangs and [[organized crime]] in [[New York City]] in a brutal fashion. Battling against Italian [[Gangster|mobsters]] and later eventually killing a serial murderer and pedophile, [[Billy Kincaid]], Spawn finds a new purpose in stopping evil.\n\n=== Early history ===\nIn his early battles, Spawn faces street thugs and gangs, becoming a dark and brutal [[antihero]], culminating in the brutal murder of a pedophile and child murderer named [[Billy Kincaid]]. As a result, he gains the attention of the detective duo of Sam Burke and Twitch Williams. It is around this time that Spawn becomes \"King of Rat City\", a gathering of alleys where bums and the homeless live. There he meets the bum [[Cogliostro]], who seems to know much more about Spawn than he first lets on, and becomes his mentor.\n\nSpawn is also hunted by the warrior angel, [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], who hunts Hellspawns for sport,<ref name=booker/> and battles the cyborg mob enforcer [[Overt-Kill]]. This confrontation almost kills Spawn, but he is able to emerge victoriously. He is again hunted by Angela and fights the angelic warrior, [[Anti-Spawn]] a.k.a. the Redeemer, who was, in fact, Jason Wynn.<ref name=booker/>\n\n==== First metamorphosis ====\nAfter a confrontation with the Redeemer, Spawn's suit mutates and becomes more advanced. Its new cape and chains were able to shapeshift into different things to confuse his opponents. The cape now looked slightly torn, and the costume had lost its red glow, having evolved to what is now black and white. Spawn's boots and gloves had also changed, having been replaced with spikes. Spawn used his new equipment to slash off the Redeemer's hand and defeat him. Spawn thought that the battle was over until he met someone more powerful than The Redeemer known as the [[Freak (Image Comics)|Freak]]. Spawn fought with the Freak but was caught unaware by the Freak's ability to create nightmares, which he did to torture Spawn with his past. During the battle, a creature appearing to have the original appearance of Spawn fights other beings and creatures and knocks out Spawn. When Spawn awakens, the creature tells him that ever since the metamorphosis, the suit will feed off of souls. Spawn later finds himself in New York City. He would fight with The Curse, meet Harry Houdini who taught him about magic, and also meet Batman.\n\nAfter this, Tony Twist sends a reprogrammed [[Overt-Kill]] after Terry, blaming him for the recent attacks on the mob, and Spawn is forced to reveal his identity while saving his friend. However, it is a well-placed shot from Twitch Williams that brings down Overt-Kill. He would later bring back his friend Bobby after he was killed in another fight with Chapel. Spawn would be a part of Angela's trial and later traveled to the South and had an encounter with the KKK and an abusive father of two boys. When he returned to New York, he was attacked by a new Redeemer. This caused his costume to evolve and defeat the Redeemer with its new-found power. After another encounter with the Curse, the suit began to go wild, and, after saving Terry from cancer, sent him to Hell, but Malebolgia sent him back with full control of the suit.\n\nSpawn wears a living symbiotic costume, Leetha of the 7th House of K (also known as K7-Leetha). While wearing it, the host assumes a dominant role over his suit. His shroud, spikes, chains, and skulls are all part of an organism bonded to his central nervous system that will protect Spawn even if he is unconscious.<ref name=booker/>\n\n=== War of Heaven and Hell ===\n\n==== Battle for life ====\nAs Spawn struggled to find a way to get rid of Hell's control and regain control, he noticed that the attacks were coming from both Heaven and Hell. Due to increasing attacks, Spawn began to lose himself to evil. However, thanks to the arrival of the Heap, an emissary of the Greenworld, he was able to regain his goal. Greenworld is a dimension whose power was equal to both Heaven's and Hell's, which Spawn had never faced before. They gave new powers to Spawn so he could better understand the world and its people,<ref name=booker/> which allowed him to overcome the worst from both Heaven and Hell. Though these powers were not really known, they seem to give control of all the elements around the world.\n\nIt was around this time that Spawn battled the powerful god Urizen. Spawn once stopped a cult from summoning Urizen, but this time he had been summoned by two gate opener demons named Ab and Zab. Urizen was causing massive destruction to the world and after losing a battle to him, Spawn came back and used his new abilities to make the Earth itself swallow Urizen and imprison him.<ref name=booker/>\n\nIt was explained that the Greenworld had no interest in the war of Heaven and Hell, but was getting frustrated with the destruction that it brought. This caused Earth \"pain\", and later Spawn became aware of it. Spawn did not change his powers though, but rather, \"listened\" to the Earth, until being attacked by Urizen. After recovering, Spawn learns that the Greenworld had imbued him with a gift, which he uses to contain Urizen by splitting the ground and imprisoning him inside the earth.<ref name=\"booker\" />\n\nAfter his battle, Spawn learned that Malebolgia had caused Urizen's release in an attempt to start Armageddon and conquer the forces of Heaven. Spawn and Angela then journeyed to Hell to stop him. During the battle, Angela managed to mortally wound Malebolgia but gets killed by him in retaliation. Consumed with anger, Spawn takes Malebolgia's head.<ref name=booker/>\n\n==== King of Hell ====\nUpon killing Malebolgia, Spawn learns that Hell's throne is rightfully his, offered to him by the demon Mammon. Though he refuses the offer, Spawn eventually deliberates with his teacher Cog and decides to turn Hell into a new paradise. During this act, Cog reveals that he is, in reality, the biblical [[Cain]], who was the first person to go to Hell, having murdered his own brother in envy. His true goal had always been to take over Hell and use a Hellspawn to do it. Having betrayed Spawn, Cog took the throne for himself, but gave his former student his human form back, a parting gift.<ref name=booker/>\n\nAfter returning, he meets a young Wiccan named Nyx. With her help, he regains his suit, though he remains weaker than before due to still having a human form. However, Mammon tricks and betrays Nyx and usurps her control over Spawn's union with his suit, removing all of Spawn's past memories in the process. With no memory, Spawn wanders the Earth, and during this time releases a group of angels who are called the Forgotten and take no sides in the war between Heaven and Hell. He discovers that Mammon is a member of the Fallen who was sent to Hell.\n\n====Spawn in Armageddon====\nSpawn regains his memories thanks to the power of the Greenworld. His suit also evolves once more and now it seems one with his body, but as time progresses, he begins to hate himself. Both Heaven and Hell have rejected him and he now stays in an abandoned warehouse as maggots and other insects crawl inside his body as he wonders what he should do. His first thought is to return to the Dead Zone, although it and a Hellspawn wouldn't be welcomed. Immediately upon entering, Spawn is confronted by the Disciple, who promptly greets him by tearing his brain out and throwing his heart into the Greenworld whilst Spawn's body is thrown to Hell. Spawn is then captured and tortured by Mammon so he can understand the secrets inside him.<ref name=booker/>\n\nWhen Spawn's heart fell to the Greenworld, a soul was freed, as all the souls that died within the hour Al died went into the Spawn suit (thus why Malebolgia could not control Spawn). Chris meets with his mother once more like the Man of Miracles instructed him and then he travels to hell along with Sam Burke and Twitch Williams to rescue Spawn from Mammon. Spawn escapes and when he returns to Earth, signs of Armageddon begin to appear; Spawn begins looking for a way to stop it. Spawn discovers that Wanda's twin children are responsible. He stops them from killing their entire family but is unable to destroy them. Zera reveals that Jake is God and Katie is Satan.\n\nSpawn finds out that the Mother removed them of their powers and positions and sent them to Earth due to their hatred of each other and constant fighting. She tells him he cannot stop Armageddon, but he has the potential to be elevated to the power of a god and preserve the human race.\n\nHe has to eat a piece of Forbidden Fruit from the Garden of Eden to gain such power. She tells Spawn he must prove himself first and has to fight against The Disciple. It is revealed that there are 12 Disciples, each one representing one of Jesus\u2019. His power is also weakened as a demon is never to enter the Garden and it has taken the form of a counter starting at 9:9:9:9. However, with guidance from Cyan, he defeats all the Disciples except for the last, Judas, who Cyan tells him not to kill. Judas then stabs him in the heart, but the Mother gives Spawn a piece of the fruit and resurrects him. He gains a more angelic form and greater power.\n\nHe returns to Earth, finding it destroyed by the Four Horsemen and all the humans dead and angels and demons in their place, waiting to fight in the final battle. After defeating Zera, he finds dead warriors of Heaven; one of them is Granny Blake, having been betrayed by her faith. Spawn then battles the forces of Satan and God. He uses all the power given to him by the Mother to destroy the forces of Heaven and Hell and even all humanity. He has stopped Armageddon by taking away their armies; he is then killed by the two who then fight alone on Earth.\n\nHowever, Spawn comes back and, by opening himself to the power of the Mother, resurrects everyone with the knowledge of what happened. He left God and Satan to fight in their own little world and closed the doors to Heaven, Hell, and Earth. He asked to be turned into a human again by the Mother but later asked to once again become a Hellspawn when he remembered that, prior to his first death as Al Simmons, he had actually beaten Wanda to cause her to miscarry their child so that he could focus on his \"work\", causing him to conclude that he had always been a monster and did not deserve to try and be human again.\n\n=== Back in the mortal world ===\n\n====New Clown====\nAfter a series of odd murders, Spawn finds that the Clown has come back, possessing the body of a man named Barney Saunders. It was revealed that Saunders was having an affair with a woman named Wilma Barbara and got trapped in a garbage chute when he was trying to hide from her husband. He was there for some time until Spawn destroyed and remade the world. He was rescued by the Clown so he could use his body for himself. He then brought out the dark urges inside the tenants of an apartment building and used this to form a doorway to Hell to bring back his brothers. However, before he could form a portal, Wilma showed up and his love for her allowed Saunders to take back control. He then intended to close the portal by going through it, but he took Wilma with him due to being angry over her leaving him in the chute.\n\nZera reappeared; only her head survived and she was suspended in a jar. Spawn was summoned by a voodoo priestess named Mambo Suzanne. Zera was attempting to take over Nyx's body and fight Spawn, but she was killed when Suzanne used their fighting as a distraction and threw her head into the streets where it was eaten by demon dogs. Nyx was freed and she and Spawn became friends again.\n\nAb and Zab create a hell where visitors are forced to view their deepest fears due to demons called sin eaters that feed on guilt from the visitors, then making them face the evil that they had ever done. A woman who was in the house both had delusions of their fear caused by the sin eaters. They fed on the guilt, giving them more power when Spawn confronted Ab and Zab. He was faced with his own sin against Wanda and his unborn child. Spawn was unable to break free from the guilt and was slowly fed on by a sin eater. When Nyx interfered, he was able to break the sin eater illusion. Nyx realized that he was getting more powerful. Spawn breaks all the others illusions; then he comes across one he learns is Albert Simmons' brother, Richard, who was going through his worst sin Spawn who was still not yet recovering from all those memories as Albert Simmons.\n\nSpawn decides to allow Richard to feel his sins. It is realized that it was Mammon (as Mr. Malefick) that put an influence on Albert Simmons and taught him to torture and murder small animals, attempting to make him become a servant who would feel no pity in taking a being's life. Malefick had also influenced Richard Simmons to take drugs and introduced him to the drug dealer Weasel. It was only Marc Simmons who was able to save himself from Mammon but was unable to help the others. Richard Simmons' delusion of his past climaxed with him stabbing and injuring Weasel with a knife that was given to him by Mammon while intoxicated on drugs. Richard calls his brothers to help him save the drug dealer's life and Albert Simmons, not wanting his brothers getting in the crime, decides instead of calling an ambulance, pulls the knife from Weasel's body and kills him with it. Mammon appears, sending the brothers home while he hides the drug dealer's body.\n\nNyx and Spawn then kill the last sin eater and Spawn discovers that Richard cannot remember their parents due to a spell placed by Mammon; Spawn goes to find out about them. He finds their home under a spell placed by Mammon, keeping them there for years. His mother is not shocked by his form, but his father is. It was revealed his mother planned with Mammon to create a Hellspawn stronger than the others, but his father was grief-stricken that he couldn't stop her. He is then given a journal by his father that his mother prevented him from seeing. It revealed that his ancestor came across a Hellspawn in the past known as the Gunslinger Spawn.\n\n===Spawn at his prime===\nThe comic series during the continuation from the last issue Spawn was left helpless and at a little weakened against his enemy Erskine's psychic powers, and although Spawn had psychic powers of his own he was in trouble due to Erskine's creation of a tentacle creature that had the ability to impale his enemies. This creature also showed the features of Mammon that was coaxing. Nyx had come out of nowhere to stab the creature with a sword, but not killing the creature just stunning it to get its attention, but it was a mistake by Nyx only making herself the creature's target. Next, she uses her telepathic powers to contact Marc Simmons, asking him to shoot Erskine. Erskine retaliates and ceases Marc's attack and accidentally grabbed the trigger of Marc's special gun causing the creature to disappear, while Spawn and Nyx go to the hospital where Erskine is.\n\nSpawn is given an opportunity of whether or not whether he should cause Erskine's death. This threatens to Spawn to enter the bubble dome, a dimension if Erskine does not reveal the location of Mammon, who Spawn believed was causing the attacks. Mammon then appears only to complicate the situation and make things worse by allowing Erskine to complete his last murder, by using a devastating psychic projection of a strange woman to attack the last victim. After all that had happened Mammon confesses that it was him who taught Erskine how to use his powers. Which been shown in his recent killing. Erskine tries to commit suicide leaving behind his possessions of the doctor who he was taken care of after he was brought to the hospital. Spawn continues to attack Mammon, and ask what Mammon wanted from him. Mammon tells him that he was a special being with great divine powers.\n\nLater a man wakes in a mortuary with no memory of who he is. Soon some doctors working on him discover he is alive and panic only to be killed by someone in a robe. The person was previously seen with Mammon and is revealed to be Morana. Severin is the man's name and he finds that he is one of the first species of vampires called the Vrykolakas. However, he wants to die and Morana promises him death in return for his help. While Marc, Nyx and Spawn talk Severin appears defeats Marc and Nyx and bites Spawn to transfer his vampirism. He retreats back to Morana hoping for death but is cursed to have to go over his last few moments repeatedly for all time.\n\nIt is revealed Cyan has been experiencing horrid visions mostly of her mother covered in blood and even Spawn's current torment. Severin's attack has caused Spawn to battle the suit in his mind. It tells him it was always in control not Al. It tells him of its anger of relinquishing his godlike powers and that Wanda had been having affairs before his death. The two fight in Spawn's mind him in his human form as the suit tells him Wanda never wanted his child soon Al gives in and gets up. Meanwhile, Mammon with Morana and his adopted mother and father Lucian and Daciana as they prepare for the next step in their plans. Cyan is having more visions that cause her to be scared of Spawn and after seeing her door in blood she opens it to find Spawn asking if he's going to kill her mom. Luckily Granny had warned Cyan and she used a knife with the old shoelace she got from Spawn to send Spawn into an illusionary world to talk to Wanda non-violently.\n\n====Morana====\nThere, he speaks with Wanda while they ride on a boat in a lake. He says he wanted to move on but can't. Wanda wonders if he could go if she forgave him.  She says she cannot forgive Al for the death of their child, but that she still loves the man inside him. Spawn tries to take out Cyan's knife, but only pulls out his wedding ring and somehow suppresses the suit. Soon, Cyan and Nyx show up, and they get to the shore only for K7-Leetha to appear and take over Nyx. It says it has been working with Mammon from the start to build Spawn and in return would get to live on freely on earth. Now controlled by the K7, Nyx tries to kill Cyan and Wanda but is halted by Mammon, who promises even more power if K7 still obeys his wishes. The entire group goes to a castle, where Mammon says his plan to make a perfect Hellspawn. He wanted the Rapture to occur so that Satan, God, and Malebolgia would be gone, and then revealed his perfect Hellspawn was Al and Wanda's miscarried child: Morana. He chose those two due to the fact that both their families have been filled with Spawns' from previous times.\n\nAfter washing herself in the virgin's blood, Morana is now fully mature.  She bonds with the uniform and gets ready to consume her parents' souls. With none of the most powerful magic being usable, Cyan taps into her powers and goes to the future. She talks with an old woman who gives her a message for Al. Returning, she has Spawn summon the last twelve (but most powerful) members of the Legion. They are beaten by Morana one by one. Mammon insults Al, and in turn, he disowns Morana, enraging her, which gives Cyan the chance to tell Nyx a spell to trap Mammon and Morana. It works, both demons are sealed away, and the others return home, save Al, who jumped into another dimension to be reborn as a weapon against both heaven and hell.\n\n====Endgame====\nSpawn passes Vickie through that reality and is soon ready to enter the human dimension. He makes his way to a certain point in the alleys (probably the spot he first returned from hell) and then blows off his head. Meanwhile, a man under the name Jim Downing, who is without his memories and is healing (unusually fast) at a hospital, wakes up. He seems to know Spawn, as he was thinking about him before his awakening. A janitor tries to make money off Jim's story and calls a lawyer. The lawyer then calls someone else and tells the janitor not to go to the papers, after which the lawyer commits suicide. Soon, a thug is paid to capture Jim. While he is talking to a nurse who prayed for his recovery, the thug attacks with a flaming skull. Jim flees while the thug causes a massive amount of damage to the hospital. Soon, the thug catches up to Jim, but Jim transforms into Spawn, kills his attacker, then escapes the burning hospital back in human form, eventually being taken in by firefighters.\n\nHe is later transported to another hospital with other patients. He later leaves and reunites with his previous nurse Sara. After remembering his first transformation, he begins to turn again. He calls to Sara but leaves before she can see him. Meanwhile, a reporter begins to ask questions about what happened at the hospital. Wandering the city Jim is attacked and effortlessly kills his would-be killers. This draws the attention of Sam and Twitch, who recognize the chaos as something Spawn may do.\n\nAfter again reuniting with Sara and telling him about his transformation, he then wanders off again, only to run into Wanda Blake, Al Simmons' ex-wife. She recognizes Jim as the form Al took when he originally came back to earth, and she realizes he is a Spawn like Al.\n\nOn her advice, he travels to Rat City and finds Spawn's throne, where Spawn ruled, and is met by an angel. He ends up fighting the angel, who calls him a traitor during the fight. Fearing the angel has done something to Sara, he beats the angel and leaves. Jim finds out that a man was asking questions about him, later finding out the man was working from another man named Gilbert Sanchez.\n\nThe angel Spawn beat is later attacked by Clown who removes her wings. When Spawn returns he sees the angel both powerless and insane and is surprised to find Freak and later Violator himself. Despite Freak's warnings Clown begins to deceive Jim and informs him that his suit is a living being but then vanishes. Clown later allows himself to be arrested by Sam and Twitch to meet the leader of a vampire group to attempt to form a unity between the leader, Clown, and Spawn.\n\nGilbert Sanchez is later killed by other mob members for his information on the new Spawn. Spawn attempts to learn more about him, but after being assaulted uses his powers on his attacker. Jim later finds the man who had been asking Sara questions. He tracks to his family's home which is suddenly bombed killing everyone inside but Spawn. He is later able to find more mob members and questions them further and then finishing them when he's done.\n\n====Resurrection====\nIn Resurrection, Spawn is revived and is later told by God in dog form that Wanda had died and is now trapped in Hell where Al must rescue her. It is also shown that he wasn't abusive towards his wife and had an unborn son instead of a daughter as it was a false memory made by the demons to get him to commit suicide. He later fights Satan and saves his wife. God and Satan were no longer twins due to the Man of Miracles being sold to Marvel and thus was [[retconned]] out of existence with God being based on a variation on the traditional Abrahamic story of Creation alongside Satan's origins being based on that as well though Mother of Existence does show up in 297. After Saving Wanda from Satan she goes to heaven and Spawn continues to protect the people in Wanda's memory from the forces of both Heaven and Hell as well as any supernatural threats.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n===Spawn Kills Everyone===\nSpawn appears as a chibi version of himself.\n\n===Hellspawn===\nA version of Spawn in an alternative route after defeating Malebolgia\n\n===Shadows of Spawn===\nIn this version Ken Kurobawa takes up the mantle with Al being referenced.\n\n===Adventures of Spawn===\nSpawn appears as Spawn X where it is lighter than previous versions.\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Spawn characters}}\n\n==Spin-offs and crossovers==\n\n;''[[Violator (comics)|Violator]]'' (1994)\n:A three-issue miniseries written by Alan Moore with art by [[Bart Sears]] which focused on the conflict between Violator/Clown and Tony Twist and also featured Spawn.\n\n;''[[Angela (comics)|Angela]]'' miniseries (1994\u20131995)\n:In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue ''Angela'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was published, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]].

This new Spawn story is known as ''The Adventures of Spawn'' and as stated by Jon Goff, a moderator on the Spawn.com Message Board and McFarlane employee, it is a re-imagining of the Spawn story that is essentially a \"What If?\" universe that hearkens back to classic kid-friendly Saturday morning cartoons.

While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters [[Cogliostro]], [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were designed and co-created by [[Todd McFarlane]] and continued to be featured in the series after Gaiman's involvement, and some had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company. Cogliostro had a prominent role in [[Spawn (1997 film)|the live-action movie]] in 1997. McFarlane had agreed that Gaiman was a co-creator of the characters and paid him royalties for reprints, graphic novels, and action figures.<ref name=\"gaim1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.oafe.net/articulation/0307.php| title = Points of Articulation: KIMOTA! Neil Gaiman vs. Todd McFarlane| date = 2003-07-17| publisher = OAFEnet}}</ref> After a few years, he ceased the payment of royalties and gave Gaiman notice that he owned all rights to the characters, citing the copyright notice from #9 and claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane was the sole owner.<ref name=\"gaim2\">{{cite web| url = http://www.oafe.net/articulation/0307.php| title = Points of Articulation: KIMOTA!

Gaiman had partnered with [[Marvel Comics]] to form Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which bankrolled the lawsuit.<ref name=\"gaim1\"/> The main goal was to determine the issue of ownership for another character Gaiman felt he had a stake in, Miracleman, which at the time McFarlane was believed to hold a sizable stake in after his buyout of the assets of [[Eclipse Comics]]. This issue was thrown out. Instead, the court chose to rule on the breach of contract issue, the rights of ownership and the copyrightability of the characters from ''Spawn'' #9. Several arguments were presented by McFarlane and all were rejected, leading to a sizable judgment against McFarlane and [[Image Comics]].<ref name=\"gaim1\"/> The matter went to appeal and the judgment was upheld in a 2003 decision.<ref name=\"WagnerGolden2008\"/><ref name=\"gaim2\"/>\n\nGaiman's rights as co-creator and co-owner of Cogliostro, Angela, and Medieval Spawn were acknowledged.<ref name=\"gaim2\"/> The court's view was that Gaiman and McFarlane's collaboration led to each contributing half of the work.<ref name=\"gaim2\"/> Gaiman wrote the story while McFarlane illustrated the character; because of this, each held a 50% stake in the characters. Issue 9 was reprinted for the first time since the lawsuit was filed in the hardcover edition of ''Spawn Origins: Volume 1''. In a reprint collection of the first twelve issues of ''Spawn'', the contentious issue (along with [[Dave Sim]]'s #10, featuring copyrighted character [[Cerebus]]) was excluded, but both issues have been reprinted in the hardcover and deluxe editions ''Spawn Origins: Volume 1''.

Created by [[Todd McFarlane]], the character first appeared in ''Spawn'' #1 (May 1992). Spawn was ranked 60th on ''[[Wizard magazine|Wizard]]'' magazine's list of the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, 50th on ''[[Empire magazine|Empire]]'' magazine's list of The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters, and 36th on IGN's 2011 Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.<ref>[http://ie.ign.com/videos/2011/05/05/igns-top-100-comic-book-heroes-40-21 \"IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: (40\u201321)\"].

He is the second eldest of three children (Marc, Albert, and Richard) born to Bernard Simmons- a traveling salesman- and Esther Simmons- a devil worshipper. Simmons is a highly intelligent and physically strong [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He later joins the [[United States Secret Service]] and becomes a highly decorated member. This leads to his recruitment to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Once in the CIA, Simmons joins the U.S. Security Group- an umbrella agency encompassing the [[CIA]], the [[NSA]], and the [[National Security Council|NSC]]- commanded by Director [[Jason Wynn]], and becomes a highly capable assassin.\n\nAfter being murdered during a mission in [[Botswana]] when Director Wynn hires Simmons' friend and partner, Bruce Stinson (codename [[Chapel (comics)|Chapel]]), to kill him, Simmons is sent to [[Hell]] due to his life as an assassin.<ref name=\"Nelson2012\">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Victoria|title=Gothicka: Vampire Heroes, Human Gods, and the New Supernatural|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeTmjxcT0g8C&pg=PT103|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-06540-6|pages=103\u2013104}}</ref><ref name=booker>{{cite book|editor=M.

With only vague recollections of his past and how he came to be, he only knew his name, 'Al Simmons,' and that he died, but nothing else.\n\nOccasionally experiencing painful flashbacks, he eventually remembers his deal with Malebolgia, but can't remember his wife's name in order to return to her. \n\nUsing CIA files, he tracks down his wife to find her married to his former best friend, Terry, with a daughter named Cyan,<ref name=booker/> and realizes that five years have passed since his death.\n\nSpawn soon runs into a fellow Hellspawn who informs him that his powers are fueled by [[Necroplasm]], and once they are fully depleted, he will return to Hell.\n\nNot wanting to return to Hell, Spawn attempts to find a new purpose in life, while using as little power as possible. Spawn is thrust into several [[antihero]] adventures where he takes down street gangs and [[organized crime]] in [[New York City]] in a brutal fashion. Battling against Italian [[Gangster|mobsters]] and later eventually killing a serial murderer and pedophile, [[Billy Kincaid]], Spawn finds a new purpose in stopping evil.\n\n=== Early history ===\nIn his early battles, Spawn faces street thugs and gangs, becoming a dark and brutal [[antihero]], culminating in the brutal murder of a pedophile and child murderer named [[Billy Kincaid]]. As a result, he gains the attention of the detective duo of Sam Burke and Twitch Williams. It is around this time that Spawn becomes \"King of Rat City\", a gathering of alleys where bums and the homeless live. There he meets the bum [[Cogliostro]], who seems to know much more about Spawn than he first lets on, and becomes his mentor.\n\nSpawn is also hunted by the warrior angel, [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], who hunts Hellspawns for sport,<ref name=booker/> and battles the cyborg mob enforcer [[Overt-Kill]]. This confrontation almost kills Spawn, but he is able to emerge victoriously. He is again hunted by Angela and fights the angelic warrior, [[Anti-Spawn]] a.k.a. the Redeemer, who was, in fact, Jason Wynn.<ref name=booker/>\n\n==== First metamorphosis ====\nAfter a confrontation with the Redeemer, Spawn's suit mutates and becomes more advanced. Its new cape and chains were able to shapeshift into different things to confuse his opponents. The cape now looked slightly torn, and the costume had lost its red glow, having evolved to what is now black and white. Spawn's boots and gloves had also changed, having been replaced with spikes. Spawn used his new equipment to slash off the Redeemer's hand and defeat him. Spawn thought that the battle was over until he met someone more powerful than The Redeemer known as the [[Freak (Image Comics)|Freak]]. Spawn fought with the Freak but was caught unaware by the Freak's ability to create nightmares, which he did to torture Spawn with his past. During the battle, a creature appearing to have the original appearance of Spawn fights other beings and creatures and knocks out Spawn. When Spawn awakens, the creature tells him that ever since the metamorphosis, the suit will feed off of souls. Spawn later finds himself in New York City. He would fight with The Curse, meet Harry Houdini who taught him about magic, and also meet Batman.\n\nAfter this, Tony Twist sends a reprogrammed [[Overt-Kill]] after Terry, blaming him for the recent attacks on the mob, and Spawn is forced to reveal his identity while saving his friend. However, it is a well-placed shot from Twitch Williams that brings down Overt-Kill. He would later bring back his friend Bobby after he was killed in another fight with Chapel. Spawn would be a part of Angela's trial and later traveled to the South and had an encounter with the KKK and an abusive father of two boys. When he returned to New York, he was attacked by a new Redeemer. This caused his costume to evolve and defeat the Redeemer with its new-found power. After another encounter with the Curse, the suit began to go wild, and, after saving Terry from cancer, sent him to Hell, but Malebolgia sent him back with full control of the suit.\n\nSpawn wears a living symbiotic costume, Leetha of the 7th House of K (also known as K7-Leetha). While wearing it, the host assumes a dominant role over his suit. His shroud, spikes, chains, and skulls are all part of an organism bonded to his central nervous system that will protect Spawn even if he is unconscious.<ref name=booker/>\n\n=== War of Heaven and Hell ===\n\n==== Battle for life ====\nAs Spawn struggled to find a way to get rid of Hell's control and regain control, he noticed that the attacks were coming from both Heaven and Hell. Due to increasing attacks, Spawn began to lose himself to evil. However, thanks to the arrival of the Heap, an emissary of the Greenworld, he was able to regain his goal. Greenworld is a dimension whose power was equal to both Heaven's and Hell's, which Spawn had never faced before. They gave new powers to Spawn so he could better understand the world and its people,<ref name=booker/> which allowed him to overcome the worst from both Heaven and Hell. Though these powers were not really known, they seem to give control of all the elements around the world.\n\nIt was around this time that Spawn battled the powerful god Urizen. Spawn once stopped a cult from summoning Urizen, but this time he had been summoned by two gate opener demons named Ab and Zab. Urizen was causing massive destruction to the world and after losing a battle to him, Spawn came back and used his new abilities to make the Earth itself swallow Urizen and imprison him.<ref name=booker/>\n\nIt was explained that the Greenworld had no interest in the war of Heaven and Hell, but was getting frustrated with the destruction that it brought. This caused Earth \"pain\", and later Spawn became aware of it. Spawn did not change his powers though, but rather, \"listened\" to the Earth, until being attacked by Urizen. After recovering, Spawn learns that the Greenworld had imbued him with a gift, which he uses to contain Urizen by splitting the ground and imprisoning him inside the earth.<ref name=\"booker\" />\n\nAfter his battle, Spawn learned that Malebolgia had caused Urizen's release in an attempt to start Armageddon and conquer the forces of Heaven. Spawn and Angela then journeyed to Hell to stop him. During the battle, Angela managed to mortally wound Malebolgia but gets killed by him in retaliation. Consumed with anger, Spawn takes Malebolgia's head.<ref name=booker/>\n\n==== King of Hell ====\nUpon killing Malebolgia, Spawn learns that Hell's throne is rightfully his, offered to him by the demon Mammon. Though he refuses the offer, Spawn eventually deliberates with his teacher Cog and decides to turn Hell into a new paradise. During this act, Cog reveals that he is, in reality, the biblical [[Cain]], who was the first person to go to Hell, having murdered his own brother in envy. His true goal had always been to take over Hell and use a Hellspawn to do it. Having betrayed Spawn, Cog took the throne for himself, but gave his former student his human form back, a parting gift.<ref name=booker/>\n\nAfter returning, he meets a young Wiccan named Nyx. With her help, he regains his suit, though he remains weaker than before due to still having a human form. However, Mammon tricks and betrays Nyx and usurps her control over Spawn's union with his suit, removing all of Spawn's past memories in the process. With no memory, Spawn wanders the Earth, and during this time releases a group of angels who are called the Forgotten and take no sides in the war between Heaven and Hell. He discovers that Mammon is a member of the Fallen who was sent to Hell.\n\n====Spawn in Armageddon====\nSpawn regains his memories thanks to the power of the Greenworld. His suit also evolves once more and now it seems one with his body, but as time progresses, he begins to hate himself. Both Heaven and Hell have rejected him and he now stays in an abandoned warehouse as maggots and other insects crawl inside his body as he wonders what he should do. His first thought is to return to the Dead Zone, although it and a Hellspawn wouldn't be welcomed. Immediately upon entering, Spawn is confronted by the Disciple, who promptly greets him by tearing his brain out and throwing his heart into the Greenworld whilst Spawn's body is thrown to Hell. Spawn is then captured and tortured by Mammon so he can understand the secrets inside him.<ref name=booker/>\n\nWhen Spawn's heart fell to the Greenworld, a soul was freed, as all the souls that died within the hour Al died went into the Spawn suit (thus why Malebolgia could not control Spawn). Chris meets with his mother once more like the Man of Miracles instructed him and then he travels to hell along with Sam Burke and Twitch Williams to rescue Spawn from Mammon. Spawn escapes and when he returns to Earth, signs of Armageddon begin to appear; Spawn begins looking for a way to stop it. Spawn discovers that Wanda's twin children are responsible. He stops them from killing their entire family but is unable to destroy them. Zera reveals that Jake is God and Katie is Satan.\n\nSpawn finds out that the Mother removed them of their powers and positions and sent them to Earth due to their hatred of each other and constant fighting. She tells him he cannot stop Armageddon, but he has the potential to be elevated to the power of a god and preserve the human race.\n\nHe has to eat a piece of Forbidden Fruit from the Garden of Eden to gain such power. She tells Spawn he must prove himself first and has to fight against The Disciple. It is revealed that there are 12 Disciples, each one representing one of Jesus\u2019. His power is also weakened as a demon is never to enter the Garden and it has taken the form of a counter starting at 9:9:9:9. However, with guidance from Cyan, he defeats all the Disciples except for the last, Judas, who Cyan tells him not to kill. Judas then stabs him in the heart, but the Mother gives Spawn a piece of the fruit and resurrects him. He gains a more angelic form and greater power.\n\nHe returns to Earth, finding it destroyed by the Four Horsemen and all the humans dead and angels and demons in their place, waiting to fight in the final battle. After defeating Zera, he finds dead warriors of Heaven; one of them is Granny Blake, having been betrayed by her faith. Spawn then battles the forces of Satan and God. He uses all the power given to him by the Mother to destroy the forces of Heaven and Hell and even all humanity. He has stopped Armageddon by taking away their armies; he is then killed by the two who then fight alone on Earth.\n\nHowever, Spawn comes back and, by opening himself to the power of the Mother, resurrects everyone with the knowledge of what happened. He left God and Satan to fight in their own little world and closed the doors to Heaven, Hell, and Earth. He asked to be turned into a human again by the Mother but later asked to once again become a Hellspawn when he remembered that, prior to his first death as Al Simmons, he had actually beaten Wanda to cause her to miscarry their child so that he could focus on his \"work\", causing him to conclude that he had always been a monster and did not deserve to try and be human again.\n\n=== Back in the mortal world ===\n\n====New Clown====\nAfter a series of odd murders, Spawn finds that the Clown has come back, possessing the body of a man named Barney Saunders. It was revealed that Saunders was having an affair with a woman named Wilma Barbara and got trapped in a garbage chute when he was trying to hide from her husband. He was there for some time until Spawn destroyed and remade the world. He was rescued by the Clown so he could use his body for himself. He then brought out the dark urges inside the tenants of an apartment building and used this to form a doorway to Hell to bring back his brothers. However, before he could form a portal, Wilma showed up and his love for her allowed Saunders to take back control. He then intended to close the portal by going through it, but he took Wilma with him due to being angry over her leaving him in the chute.\n\nZera reappeared; only her head survived and she was suspended in a jar. Spawn was summoned by a voodoo priestess named Mambo Suzanne. Zera was attempting to take over Nyx's body and fight Spawn, but she was killed when Suzanne used their fighting as a distraction and threw her head into the streets where it was eaten by demon dogs. Nyx was freed and she and Spawn became friends again.\n\nAb and Zab create a hell where visitors are forced to view their deepest fears due to demons called sin eaters that feed on guilt from the visitors, then making them face the evil that they had ever done. A woman who was in the house both had delusions of their fear caused by the sin eaters. They fed on the guilt, giving them more power when Spawn confronted Ab and Zab. He was faced with his own sin against Wanda and his unborn child. Spawn was unable to break free from the guilt and was slowly fed on by a sin eater. When Nyx interfered, he was able to break the sin eater illusion. Nyx realized that he was getting more powerful. Spawn breaks all the others illusions; then he comes across one he learns is Albert Simmons' brother, Richard, who was going through his worst sin Spawn who was still not yet recovering from all those memories as Albert Simmons.\n\nSpawn decides to allow Richard to feel his sins. It is realized that it was Mammon (as Mr. Malefick) that put an influence on Albert Simmons and taught him to torture and murder small animals, attempting to make him become a servant who would feel no pity in taking a being's life. Malefick had also influenced Richard Simmons to take drugs and introduced him to the drug dealer Weasel. It was only Marc Simmons who was able to save himself from Mammon but was unable to help the others. Richard Simmons' delusion of his past climaxed with him stabbing and injuring Weasel with a knife that was given to him by Mammon while intoxicated on drugs. Richard calls his brothers to help him save the drug dealer's life and Albert Simmons, not wanting his brothers getting in the crime, decides instead of calling an ambulance, pulls the knife from Weasel's body and kills him with it. Mammon appears, sending the brothers home while he hides the drug dealer's body.\n\nNyx and Spawn then kill the last sin eater and Spawn discovers that Richard cannot remember their parents due to a spell placed by Mammon; Spawn goes to find out about them. He finds their home under a spell placed by Mammon, keeping them there for years. His mother is not shocked by his form, but his father is. It was revealed his mother planned with Mammon to create a Hellspawn stronger than the others, but his father was grief-stricken that he couldn't stop her. He is then given a journal by his father that his mother prevented him from seeing. It revealed that his ancestor came across a Hellspawn in the past known as the Gunslinger Spawn.\n\n===Spawn at his prime===\nThe comic series during the continuation from the last issue Spawn was left helpless and at a little weakened against his enemy Erskine's psychic powers, and although Spawn had psychic powers of his own he was in trouble due to Erskine's creation of a tentacle creature that had the ability to impale his enemies. This creature also showed the features of Mammon that was coaxing. Nyx had come out of nowhere to stab the creature with a sword, but not killing the creature just stunning it to get its attention, but it was a mistake by Nyx only making herself the creature's target. Next, she uses her telepathic powers to contact Marc Simmons, asking him to shoot Erskine. Erskine retaliates and ceases Marc's attack and accidentally grabbed the trigger of Marc's special gun causing the creature to disappear, while Spawn and Nyx go to the hospital where Erskine is.\n\nSpawn is given an opportunity of whether or not whether he should cause Erskine's death. This threatens to Spawn to enter the bubble dome, a dimension if Erskine does not reveal the location of Mammon, who Spawn believed was causing the attacks. Mammon then appears only to complicate the situation and make things worse by allowing Erskine to complete his last murder, by using a devastating psychic projection of a strange woman to attack the last victim. After all that had happened Mammon confesses that it was him who taught Erskine how to use his powers. Which been shown in his recent killing. Erskine tries to commit suicide leaving behind his possessions of the doctor who he was taken care of after he was brought to the hospital. Spawn continues to attack Mammon, and ask what Mammon wanted from him. Mammon tells him that he was a special being with great divine powers.\n\nLater a man wakes in a mortuary with no memory of who he is. Soon some doctors working on him discover he is alive and panic only to be killed by someone in a robe. The person was previously seen with Mammon and is revealed to be Morana. Severin is the man's name and he finds that he is one of the first species of vampires called the Vrykolakas. However, he wants to die and Morana promises him death in return for his help. While Marc, Nyx and Spawn talk Severin appears defeats Marc and Nyx and bites Spawn to transfer his vampirism. He retreats back to Morana hoping for death but is cursed to have to go over his last few moments repeatedly for all time.\n\nIt is revealed Cyan has been experiencing horrid visions mostly of her mother covered in blood and even Spawn's current torment. Severin's attack has caused Spawn to battle the suit in his mind. It tells him it was always in control not Al. It tells him of its anger of relinquishing his godlike powers and that Wanda had been having affairs before his death. The two fight in Spawn's mind him in his human form as the suit tells him Wanda never wanted his child soon Al gives in and gets up. Meanwhile, Mammon with Morana and his adopted mother and father Lucian and Daciana as they prepare for the next step in their plans. Cyan is having more visions that cause her to be scared of Spawn and after seeing her door in blood she opens it to find Spawn asking if he's going to kill her mom. Luckily Granny had warned Cyan and she used a knife with the old shoelace she got from Spawn to send Spawn into an illusionary world to talk to Wanda non-violently.\n\n====Morana====\nThere, he speaks with Wanda while they ride on a boat in a lake. He says he wanted to move on but can't. Wanda wonders if he could go if she forgave him.  She says she cannot forgive Al for the death of their child, but that she still loves the man inside him. Spawn tries to take out Cyan's knife, but only pulls out his wedding ring and somehow suppresses the suit. Soon, Cyan and Nyx show up, and they get to the shore only for K7-Leetha to appear and take over Nyx. It says it has been working with Mammon from the start to build Spawn and in return would get to live on freely on earth. Now controlled by the K7, Nyx tries to kill Cyan and Wanda but is halted by Mammon, who promises even more power if K7 still obeys his wishes. The entire group goes to a castle, where Mammon says his plan to make a perfect Hellspawn. He wanted the Rapture to occur so that Satan, God, and Malebolgia would be gone, and then revealed his perfect Hellspawn was Al and Wanda's miscarried child: Morana. He chose those two due to the fact that both their families have been filled with Spawns' from previous times.\n\nAfter washing herself in the virgin's blood, Morana is now fully mature.  She bonds with the uniform and gets ready to consume her parents' souls. With none of the most powerful magic being usable, Cyan taps into her powers and goes to the future. She talks with an old woman who gives her a message for Al. Returning, she has Spawn summon the last twelve (but most powerful) members of the Legion. They are beaten by Morana one by one. Mammon insults Al, and in turn, he disowns Morana, enraging her, which gives Cyan the chance to tell Nyx a spell to trap Mammon and Morana. It works, both demons are sealed away, and the others return home, save Al, who jumped into another dimension to be reborn as a weapon against both heaven and hell.\n\n====Endgame====\nSpawn passes Vickie through that reality and is soon ready to enter the human dimension. He makes his way to a certain point in the alleys (probably the spot he first returned from hell) and then blows off his head. Meanwhile, a man under the name Jim Downing, who is without his memories and is healing (unusually fast) at a hospital, wakes up. He seems to know Spawn, as he was thinking about him before his awakening. A janitor tries to make money off Jim's story and calls a lawyer. The lawyer then calls someone else and tells the janitor not to go to the papers, after which the lawyer commits suicide. Soon, a thug is paid to capture Jim. While he is talking to a nurse who prayed for his recovery, the thug attacks with a flaming skull. Jim flees while the thug causes a massive amount of damage to the hospital. Soon, the thug catches up to Jim, but Jim transforms into Spawn, kills his attacker, then escapes the burning hospital back in human form, eventually being taken in by firefighters.\n\nHe is later transported to another hospital with other patients. He later leaves and reunites with his previous nurse Sara. After remembering his first transformation, he begins to turn again. He calls to Sara but leaves before she can see him. Meanwhile, a reporter begins to ask questions about what happened at the hospital. Wandering the city Jim is attacked and effortlessly kills his would-be killers. This draws the attention of Sam and Twitch, who recognize the chaos as something Spawn may do.\n\nAfter again reuniting with Sara and telling him about his transformation, he then wanders off again, only to run into Wanda Blake, Al Simmons' ex-wife. She recognizes Jim as the form Al took when he originally came back to earth, and she realizes he is a Spawn like Al.\n\nOn her advice, he travels to Rat City and finds Spawn's throne, where Spawn ruled, and is met by an angel. He ends up fighting the angel, who calls him a traitor during the fight. Fearing the angel has done something to Sara, he beats the angel and leaves. Jim finds out that a man was asking questions about him, later finding out the man was working from another man named Gilbert Sanchez.\n\nThe angel Spawn beat is later attacked by Clown who removes her wings. When Spawn returns he sees the angel both powerless and insane and is surprised to find Freak and later Violator himself. Despite Freak's warnings Clown begins to deceive Jim and informs him that his suit is a living being but then vanishes. Clown later allows himself to be arrested by Sam and Twitch to meet the leader of a vampire group to attempt to form a unity between the leader, Clown, and Spawn.\n\nGilbert Sanchez is later killed by other mob members for his information on the new Spawn. Spawn attempts to learn more about him, but after being assaulted uses his powers on his attacker. Jim later finds the man who had been asking Sara questions. He tracks to his family's home which is suddenly bombed killing everyone inside but Spawn. He is later able to find more mob members and questions them further and then finishing them when he's done.\n\n====Resurrection====\nIn Resurrection, Spawn is revived and is later told by God in dog form that Wanda had died and is now trapped in Hell where Al must rescue her. It is also shown that he wasn't abusive towards his wife and had an unborn son instead of a daughter as it was a false memory made by the demons to get him to commit suicide. He later fights Satan and saves his wife. God and Satan were no longer twins due to the Man of Miracles being sold to Marvel and thus was [[retconned]] out of existence with God being based on a variation on the traditional Abrahamic story of Creation alongside Satan's origins being based on that as well though Mother of Existence does show up in 297. After Saving Wanda from Satan she goes to heaven and Spawn continues to protect the people in Wanda's memory from the forces of both Heaven and Hell as well as any supernatural threats.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n===Spawn Kills Everyone===\nSpawn appears as a chibi version of himself.\n\n===Hellspawn===\nA version of Spawn in an alternative route after defeating Malebolgia\n\n===Shadows of Spawn===\nIn this version Ken Kurobawa takes up the mantle with Al being referenced.\n\n===Adventures of Spawn===\nSpawn appears as Spawn X where it is lighter than previous versions.\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Spawn characters}}\n\n==Spin-offs and crossovers==\n\n;''[[Violator (comics)|Violator]]'' (1994)\n:A three-issue miniseries written by Alan Moore with art by [[Bart Sears]] which focused on the conflict between Violator/Clown and Tony Twist and also featured Spawn.\n\n;''[[Angela (comics)|Angela]]'' miniseries (1994\u20131995)\n:In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue ''Angela'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was published, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]].

This new Spawn story is known as ''The Adventures of Spawn'' and as stated by Jon Goff, a moderator on the Spawn.com Message Board and McFarlane employee, it is a re-imagining of the Spawn story that is essentially a \"What If?\" universe that hearkens back to classic kid-friendly Saturday morning cartoons.

While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters [[Cogliostro]], [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were designed and co-created by [[Todd McFarlane]] and continued to be featured in the series after Gaiman's involvement, and some had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company. Cogliostro had a prominent role in [[Spawn (1997 film)|the live-action movie]] in 1997. McFarlane had agreed that Gaiman was a co-creator of the characters and paid him royalties for reprints, graphic novels, and action figures.<ref name=\"gaim1\">{{cite web| url = http://www.oafe.net/articulation/0307.php| title = Points of Articulation: KIMOTA!

Gaiman had partnered with [[Marvel Comics]] to form Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which bankrolled the lawsuit.<ref name=\"gaim1\"/> The main goal was to determine the issue of ownership for another character Gaiman felt he had a stake in, Miracleman, which at the time McFarlane was believed to hold a sizable stake in after his buyout of the assets of [[Eclipse Comics]]. This issue was thrown out. Instead, the court chose to rule on the breach of contract issue, the rights of ownership and the copyrightability of the characters from ''Spawn'' #9. Several arguments were presented by McFarlane and all were rejected, leading to a sizable judgment against McFarlane and [[Image Comics]].<ref name=\"gaim1\"/> The matter went to appeal and the judgment was upheld in a 2003 decision.<ref name=\"WagnerGolden2008\"/><ref name=\"gaim2\"/>\n\nGaiman's rights as co-creator and co-owner of Cogliostro, Angela, and Medieval Spawn were acknowledged.<ref name=\"gaim2\"/> The court's view was that Gaiman and McFarlane's collaboration led to each contributing half of the work.<ref name=\"gaim2\"/> Gaiman wrote the story while McFarlane illustrated the character; because of this, each held a 50% stake in the characters. Issue 9 was reprinted for the first time since the lawsuit was filed in the hardcover edition of ''Spawn Origins: Volume 1''. In a reprint collection of the first twelve issues of ''Spawn'', the contentious issue (along with [[Dave Sim]]'s #10, featuring copyrighted character [[Cerebus]]) was excluded, but both issues have been reprinted in the hardcover and deluxe editions ''Spawn Origins: Volume 1''.
