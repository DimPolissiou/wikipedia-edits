[[Pathankot]] city is the district headquarters. The district was created on 27 July 2011.\n\n==Geography==\n\nIt is located in the foothills of the [[Sivalik Hills]]. It shares international borders with the [[Narowal District]] of [[Punjab Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]]. It also shares borders with the [[Kathua District]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Chamba District|Chamba]] and [[Kangra District|Kangra]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. [[Hoshiarpur district]] shares a boundary with Pathankot in [[Punjab, India|Eastern Punjab]]. The two main rivers \u2013 [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], pass through the district.\n\n==History==\nIn the vedic period monarchy was the form of government but from the Mahabharta period onwards we find traces of republic form of government in our country according to Mahabharta the present Himachal Pradesh was divided into a number of small tribal republics Panini (5th century B.C.)in his ashtadhayai mentioned some of the republics settled there.\nThe Janpadas mentioned in the Mahabharta and also known to Panini are the Trigarthas, the kulutas and kulindas. In Shanti Parva and Sabha Parva of the Mahabharta (chapter 52)the name of the Audambra is found mentioned at the end of the list of republic Janpadas.\n\nIt is stated that the rajas of Audumbra accompanied the rajas of kashmira, darda and trigarta to pay Nazaranas to the pandava king Yudhishtra (Mahabharta 2-52-13).the reference of the Audumbras is also find mentioned is Vishnu Puran, vayu Puran, Brihat Samihta, Satpatha Brahma and Ganpatha etc.\n\nThe state of Audumbra was lying in between the two great rivers of Ancient times as Parushni or Aravati and Vipasa presently known as River Ravi & Beas comprising whole of the Nurpur Tehsil, Tehsil of Pathankot and a large tract of plains of district Gurdaspur with its capital at Pratishthan that is present Pathankot. Praishthan was probably one of the oldest sites in the Punjab ; Pratishthan (present Pathankot) was advantageously situated on the great commerce route of ancient times, which ran from Patliputra (Patna) of Magadha state to Takshashila and further to the central Asia under the foothills.\nDuring the invasion of Alexandra's in 326 B.C. the state of Audmbra was ruled by the Katha Kashatriyas, who enjoyed the highest reputation for still in the art of war. After crossing the river Ravi, Alexander entered the territory of Audumbra State and invested Sangala a strong hold of Kathas of whom Greek called Kathains or Kathoi. The Kathas fought with great dash and studborness so much so that even Pores had to come to the help of 'Alxander with his army of Elephants and 5000 soldiers and titled the scale of victory in his favour. 17,000 Kathas were killed and more than 70,000 were captured. This resolute resistance of the Kathas incensed Alexander to such an extent that Sangala was razed to ground. All this happened near the capital town of Pratisthan (the modern Pathankot). There is no trace of Sangala, HOWEVER A VILLAGE Sangram is available near Shahpur Kandi, Tehsil Pathankot. It may be the abbreviated forms of Sangala. The town Kathua on the east bank of Ravi and Kathgarh on western bank of River Beas seems to be inhabited by the Kathas to whom Greeks called Kathoi's. On reaching near Indoura (in District Kangra) - Kathgarh - Mirthal on the Beas, the army of Alexandera refused to go further on account of alarming reports of the Military strength of Magadh State. In deep disdain Alaxandra had to announce his historical retreat September 326 B.C.\nOn the return of Alexandera, Audumbras again came into power and gained their strength. In the days of their prosperity Audumbra kings issued their coins. These early coins are thin pieces of copper either square or oblong. Their identity is marked by the symbols found on these coins such as Trident, Nandi Bull, Swastic and elephant etc. Some silver coins have also been issued by the Audumbra Kings. They were issued in the name of the community and king. These coins bear the name of the king as well as the state as Audumbrisa . Dharaghosa was probably the most famous and great king of the Audumbra republic. These coins remained in use till the fourth century A.D.\nSir A. Cunnigham, first Director General of Archeological Survey of India discovered some Audumbra coins from Pathankot itself during the second half of the nineteenth century when he visited this place.\n\nIn 1905 A.D. one Jhet Pal Tomar a younger brother of Anang Pal Tomar a king of Delhi travelled to this place and after giving defeat to Kazbak Khan established his own state called Paithan an abbreviated form of Pratishthan.\n\nJhel Pal built a strong fort at Paithan (modern Pathankot) in the early 12th century which was demolished by the Britishers after the annexation of Punjab State. Another Fort at Shahpur (Kandi) was also built by a Pathania king named Bhakhat Mal in the 15th century.\n\nIt seens to be a tradition that the ruling chief bears the distinctive appellation or clan named derived in almost every instance from the name of the country or from its capital over which they ruled following the old tradition the chief of the Paithan also adopted the clan name of his capital as Pathania which in later time became Paithania.\n\nThe name of the city Paithan remained in use till 1759 A.D. The early Muhammadan historian, the Ain - I - Akbari, the Tuzuki - I - Jahangiri and Badshahnama, all called it Paithan. Thus it is mischievous to say that the city of Pathankot was founded by the some Pathan. Sir A. Cunnigham in his Archeological Survey report of 1872-72 clearly mentioned that it has no reference to the Pathans of Afghanisthan, but is a genuine Hindu word derived from Paithan. The district Gazetteer of Kangra 1924-25 also confirms the same.\n\nThe capital of Pathania state was shifted from Pathankot to Nurpur then called Dhahmeri in the year 1595 A.D. by Raja Basu. The Pathania regime ruled the state from Pathankot for about five hundred long years and later on from Nurpur up to 1815 A.D. when the state of Nurpur was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nIn 1603 A.D. the Pargana Pathankot had been severed from Nurpur and permanently annexed by Emperor Akbar and was handed over to Mirza Rustam Qandhari which remained under Mughal control up to 1759 A.D.\n\nOn the break up to Mughal empire one Ajaib Rai Puri who was posted as Kanugo at Pathankot has established himself as a king of Pathankot and Sujanpur. Mohalla Purian of Pathankot seems to have been inhabited by this clan. Ajaib Rai Kanugo was supplanted by Sardar Nand Singh Bhangi in 1761 A.D., who died in 1775 without a male child. His widow invited Tara Singh S/o Mutsada Singh of Fatehgarh Churian, Tehsil Batala of Kahnaya Misal to come & marry her daughter and succeed her husband and took the whole of Nand Singh's possession henceforth. Pathankot remained under the control of Kahnaya Misal till 1807 A.D. when Jaimal Singh had to yield his possession to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nThe change of name from Paithan to Pathankot took place under the leadership of Sardar Gurbax Singh Kahnaya during the second half of the 19th century.\nMaharaja Rabjit Singh had 46 wife's Maharaja married a Mohamandan prostitute of Amritsar in 1802 A.D. with whom the fell in violent love. Moran enjoyed Ranjit Singh's confidence for many years and he had struck gold and silver coins in her name which were called Moran Shahi Sikkey. Suddenly in August 1811 A.D. Moran was sent to Pathankot in a Palkin which was granted to her as Jagir. It is believed that she spent last days of her life at Pathankot.\nAfter the defeat in the first Sikh- Anglo War, Pathankot along with 83 villages were attached with the newly created District of Kangra, by the British and remained as such till the formation of District Gurdaspur which commenced in 1852. In 1853 Pathankot Tehsil was formed with its Headquarters at Pathankot. Pathankot got the Tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947.\nWhole of the Indian nations celebrated Independence on 15 August 1947, but district Gurdaspur including Pathankot remained part of Pakistan for three days under Lord Mountbetan's 3 June Plan. Tricolour of India was hoisted atop of the tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947.\nAfter Independence and the arrival of the refugees from Pakistan, new faces werte seen on the roads of Pathankot. The people have started to build their carrier a fresh in the new era. Pathankot has gone through a large number of changes and developments as well. It is called gateway of Himachal Pradesh and J & K states. Ranjit Sagar Dam the Pride of Punjab has been emerged about 30&nbsp;km. north east of the town Nowadays Mamoon a suburb of Pathankot is heading towards a biggest army cantonment of Asia. Pthankot had already an Air Force Station and shall be coming on the air map of India very shortly.\nWith the opening of civil aerodrome the hotel business of the town will be largely benefitted.\nSurprisingly enough, the town is totally devoid of any monumental evidence to speak of its rich past except a high ridge called Shimla Pahari where the historical fort once existed with some part of rouni around the Gulmohar Tourist Complex. A number of various buildings such as PWD Rest House. Gulmohar Tourist Complex, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Municipal Library. Lal Bahadur Shastri Park, Relay center of Doordarshan, and an office of central PWD are located at the site of the Fort.\n\nIn present times, Pathankot is one of a vibrant places in Punjab with lot of hustle bustle making it one of the famous trade markets and that too a pretty busy one. From Pathankot it's pretty ease to travel up in the hills of Dalhousie and Dharmshala.\n\n==Demographics==\nPathankot District has a population of 626,000 as of 2011. Most of the district's population is Hindu with sizeable Sikh, Christian and Muslim minorities.\n\n==The district today==\n\nIn past, It was a Tehsil of the District Gurdaspur. The present district was formed, as the 22nd district of the state, on 27 July 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Eye on urban voter, Fazilka, Pathankot made districts|author=Naveen S.

[[Pathankot]] city is the district headquarters. The district was created on 27 July 2011.\n\n==Geography==\n\nIt is located in the foothills of the [[Sivalik Hills]]. It shares international borders with the [[Narowal District]] of [[Punjab Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]]. It also shares borders with the [[Kathua District]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Chamba District|Chamba]] and [[Kangra District|Kangra]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. [[Hoshiarpur district]] shares a boundary with Pathankot in [[Punjab, India|Eastern Punjab]]. The two main rivers \u2013 [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], pass through the district.\n\n==History==\nIn the vedic period monarchy was the form of government but from the Mahabharta period onwards we find traces of republic form of government in our country according to Mahabharta the present Himachal Pradesh was divided into a number of small tribal republics Panini (5th century B.C.)in his ashtadhayai mentioned some of the republics settled there.\nThe Janpadas mentioned in the Mahabharta and also known to Panini are the Trigarthas, the kulutas and kulindas. In Shanti Parva and Sabha Parva of the Mahabharta (chapter 52)the name of the Audambra is found mentioned at the end of the list of republic Janpadas.\n\nIt is stated that the rajas of Audumbra accompanied the rajas of kashmira, darda and trigarta to pay Nazaranas to the pandava king Yudhishtra (Mahabharta 2-52-13).the reference of the Audumbras is also find mentioned is Vishnu Puran, vayu Puran, Brihat Samihta, Satpatha Brahma and Ganpatha etc.\n\nThe state of Audumbra was lying in between the two great rivers of Ancient times as Parushni or Aravati and Vipasa presently known as River Ravi & Beas comprising whole of the Nurpur Tehsil, Tehsil of Pathankot and a large tract of plains of district Gurdaspur with its capital at Pratishthan that is present Pathankot. Praishthan was probably one of the oldest sites in the Punjab ; Pratishthan (present Pathankot) was advantageously situated on the great commerce route of ancient times, which ran from Patliputra (Patna) of Magadha state to Takshashila and further to the central Asia under the foothills.\nDuring the invasion of Alexandra's in 326 B.C. the state of Audmbra was ruled by the Katha Kashatriyas, who enjoyed the highest reputation for still in the art of war. After crossing the river Ravi, Alexander entered the territory of Audumbra State and invested Sangala a strong hold of Kathas of whom Greek called Kathains or Kathoi. The Kathas fought with great dash and studborness so much so that even Pores had to come to the help of 'Alxander with his army of Elephants and 5000 soldiers and titled the scale of victory in his favour. 17,000 Kathas were killed and more than 70,000 were captured. This resolute resistance of the Kathas incensed Alexander to such an extent that Sangala was razed to ground. All this happened near the capital town of Pratisthan (the modern Pathankot). There is no trace of Sangala, HOWEVER A VILLAGE Sangram is available near Shahpur Kandi, Tehsil Pathankot. It may be the abbreviated forms of Sangala. The town Kathua on the east bank of Ravi and Kathgarh on western bank of River Beas seems to be inhabited by the Kathas to whom Greeks called Kathoi's. On reaching near Indoura (in District Kangra) - Kathgarh - Mirthal on the Beas, the army of Alexandera refused to go further on account of alarming reports of the Military strength of Magadh State. In deep disdain Alaxandra had to announce his historical retreat September 326 B.C.\nOn the return of Alexandera, Audumbras again came into power and gained their strength. In the days of their prosperity Audumbra kings issued their coins. These early coins are thin pieces of copper either square or oblong. Their identity is marked by the symbols found on these coins such as Trident, Nandi Bull, Swastic and elephant etc. Some silver coins have also been issued by the Audumbra Kings. They were issued in the name of the community and king. These coins bear the name of the king as well as the state as Audumbrisa . Dharaghosa was probably the most famous and great king of the Audumbra republic. These coins remained in use till the fourth century A.D.\nSir A. Cunnigham, first Director General of Archeological Survey of India discovered some Audumbra coins from Pathankot itself during the second half of the nineteenth century when he visited this place.\n\nIn 1905 A.D. one Jhet Pal Tomar a younger brother of Anang Pal Tomar a king of Delhi travelled to this place and after giving defeat to Kazbak Khan established his own state called Paithan an abbreviated form of Pratishthan.\n\nJhel Pal built a strong fort at Paithan (modern Pathankot) in the early 12th century which was demolished by the Britishers after the annexation of Punjab State. Another Fort at Shahpur (Kandi) was also built by a Pathania king named Bhakhat Mal in the 15th century.\n\nIt seens to be a tradition that the ruling chief bears the distinctive appellation or clan named derived in almost every instance from the name of the country or from its capital over which they ruled following the old tradition the chief of the Paithan also adopted the clan name of his capital as Pathania which in later time became Paithania.\n\nThe name of the city Paithan remained in use till 1759 A.D. The early Muhammadan historican, the Ain - I - Akbari, the Tuzuki - I - Jahangiri and Badshahnama, all called it Paithan. Thus it is mischievous to say that the city of Pathankot was founded by the some Pathan. Sir A. Cunnigham in his Archeological Survey report of 1872-72 clearly mentioned that it has no reference to the Pathans of Afghanisthan, but is a genuine Hindu word derived from Paithan. The district Gazetteer of Kangra 1924-25 also confirms the same.\n\nThe capital of Pathania state was shifted from Pathankot to Nurpur then called Dhahmeri in the year 1595 A.D. by Raja Basu. The Pathania regime ruled the state from Pathankot for about five hundred long years and later on from Nurpur up to 1815 A.D. when the state of Nurpur was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nIn 1603 A.D. the Pargana Pathankot had been severed from Nurpur and permanently annexed by Emperor Akbar and was handed over to Mirza Rustam Qandhari which remained under Mughal control up to 1759 A.D.\n\nOn the break up to Mughal empire one Ajaib Rai Puri who was posted as Kanugo at Pathankot has established himself as a king of Pathankot and Sujanpur. Mohalla Purian of Pathankot seems to have been inhabited by this clan. Ajaib Rai Kanugo was supplanted by Sardar Nand Singh Bhangi in 1761 A.D., who died in 1775 without a male child. His widow invited Tara Singh S/o Mutsada Singh of Fatehgarh Churian, Tehsil Batala of Kahnaya Misal to come & marry her daughter and succeed her husband and took the whole of Nand Singh's possession henceforth. Pathankot remained under the control of Kahnaya Misal till 1807 A.D. when Jaimal Singh had to yield his possession to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nThe change of name from Paithan to Pathankot took place under the leadership of Sardar Gurbax Singh Kahnaya during the second half of the 19th century.\nMaharaja Rabjit Singh had 46 wife's Maharaja married a Mohamandan prostitute of Amritsar in 1802 A.D. with whom the fell in violent love. Moran enjoyed Ranjit Singh's confidence for many years and he had struck gold and silver coins in her name which were called Moran Shahi Sikkey. Suddenly in August 1811 A.D. Moran was sent to Pathankot in a Palkin which was granted to her as Jagir. It is believed that she spent last days of her life at Pathankot.\nAfter the defeat in the first Sikh- Anglo War, Pathankot along with 83 villages were attached with the newly created District of Kangra, by the British and remained as such till the formation of District Gurdaspur which commenced in 1852. In 1853 Pathankot Tehsil was formed with its Headquarters at Pathankot. Pathankot got the Tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947.\nWhole of the Indian nations celebrated Independence on 15 August 1947, but district Gurdaspur including Pathankot remained part of Pakistan for three days under Lord Mountbetan's 3 June Plan. Tricolour of India was hoisted atop of the tehsil building Pathankot on 17 August 1947.\nAfter Independence and the arrival of the refugees from Pakistan, new faces werte seen on the roads of Pathankot. The people have started to build their carrier a fresh in the new era. Pathankot has gone through a large number of changes and developments as well. It is called gateway of Himachal Pradesh and J & K states. Ranjit Sagar Dam the Pride of Punjab has been emerged about 30&nbsp;km. north east of the town Nowadays Mamoon a suburb of Pathankot is heading towards a biggest army cantonment of Asia. Pthankot had already an Air Force Station and shall be coming on the air map of India very shortly.\nWith the opening of civil aerodrome the hotel business of the town will be largely benefitted.\nSurprisingly enough, the town is totally devoid of any monumental evidence to speak of its rich past except a high ridge called Shimla Pahari where the historical fort once existed with some part of rouni around the Gulmohar Tourist Complex. A number of various buildings such as PWD Rest House. Gulmohar Tourist Complex, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Municipal Library. Lal Bahadur Shastri Park, Relay center of Doordarshan, and an office of central PWD are located at the site of the Fort.\n\nIn present times, Pathankot is one of a vibrant places in Punjab with lot of hustle bustle making it one of the famous trade markets and that too a pretty busy one. From Pathankot it's pretty ease to travel up in the hills of Dalhousie and Dharmshala.\n\n==Demographics==\nPathankot District has a population of 626,000 as of 2011. Most of the district's population is Hindu with sizeable Sikh, Christian and Muslim minorities.\n\n==The district today==\n\nIn past, It was a Tehsil of the District Gurdaspur. The present district was formed, as the 22nd district of the state, on 27 July 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Eye on urban voter, Fazilka, Pathankot made districts|author=Naveen S.

As a newly made man, Chris is liable to be strip-searched. Paulie makes him strip in the back room of the [[Bada Bing]] and makes fun of his penis size. Late one night he and [[Patsy Parisi|Patsy]] go to Chris's apartment and search his belongings. Chris sees Paulie sniffing [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]]'s panties.

Kennedy]]. They consult another doctor, who recommends that Junior receive [[chemotherapy]] treatments. A [[tumor board review]] is called and they reach the same conclusion. Junior undergoes chemo and suffers distressing side effects. He longs to speak to Kennedy, who does not return his calls. Tony and [[Furio Giunta|Furio]] confront Kennedy on his golf course and bribe and intimidate him into giving Junior his attention. Kennedy appears at the hospital, warmly greets Junior, reassures him, and gives him his home phone number. Junior beams with happiness. \n\nCarmela has lunch with the dean of [[Columbia University|Columbia]], Meadow's university. Tony refuses to go, saying that the purpose is to extort money. He will donate $5,000, no more. The dean tells her that his research indicates that the Sopranos could contribute $50,000. \n\nCarmela attends a session alone with [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] on a day when Tony does not want to go. She stresses that she does not need therapy herself, but she makes an appointment with the therapist Melfi recommends.

As a newly made man, Chris is liable to be strip-searched. Paulie makes him strip in the back room of the [[Bada Bing]] and makes fun of his penis size. Late one night he and [[Patsy Parisi|Patsy]] go to Chris's apartment and search his belongings. Chris sees Paulie sniffing [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]]'s panties. [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] dismisses Chris's complaint. Paulie warns him never to complain about him again to the \"big man\".

He does not know that Kennedy erred, removing too little of the tissue surrounding his tumor. When Kennedy says he would like to perform further surgery Junior agrees, but Tony believes Junior is too much impressed that his doctor happens to have the same name as [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. They consult another doctor, who recommends that Junior receive [[chemotherapy]] treatments. A [[tumor board review]] is called and they reach the same conclusion. Junior undergoes chemo and suffers distressing side effects. He longs to speak to Kennedy, who does not return his calls. Tony and [[Furio Giunta|Furio]] confront Kennedy on his golf course and bribe and intimidate him into giving Junior his attention. Kennedy appears at the hospital, warmly greets Junior, reassures him, and gives him his home phone number. Junior beams with happiness. \n\nCarmela has lunch with the dean of [[Columbia University|Columbia]], Meadow's university. Tony refuses to go, saying that the purpose is to extort money. He will donate $5,000, no more. The dean tells her that his research indicates that the Sopranos could contribute $50,000. \n\nCarmela attends a session alone with [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] on a day when Tony does not want to go.

The alliance took effect about a year after [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] completed their merger, as that released Continental from the [[SkyTeam]] contract and allowed for the required nine-month notice.

There is no threshold for getting a seat, making it possible for a party to get a seat with only two-thirds percent of the vote\u2014roughly one seat for every 67,000 votes.\n\nNo party has won a majority of seats since the [[1894 Dutch general election|election of 1894]]<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip St\u00f6ver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1412 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>, and no party has even approached the seats needed for a majority since the current proportional representation system was [[1918 Dutch general election|implemented in 1918]]. All Dutch governments since then have been coalitions between two or more parties.  However, there is a broad consensus on the basic principles of the political system, and all parties must adjust their goals to some extent in order to have a realistic chance at being part of the government.\n\n==General overview==\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n* The [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is a [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] party.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> As a centre-right movement, it attaches great importance to [[private enterprise]], [[market liberalism]]<ref name=\"almeida\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/europe/conferences/tgsw/documents/TGSW_Almeida_Paper.pdf |title=Liberal Parties and European Integration |last=Almeida |first=Dimitri}}</ref> and the freedom of the individual in political, social, and economic affairs. The party is generally supportive of European economic integration, but is less supportive of political integration. The party's leader is [[Mark Rutte]]. VVD is a member of the [[Liberal International]] and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]].\n* The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party, and centre-left in orientation.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> Its program is based on more social, political, and economic equality for all citizens. Former PvdA-prime minister [[Joop den Uyl]] has called it an \"equal distribution of knowledge, income and power.\" In recent years the PvdA has espoused a centrist [[Third Way]] programme. The PvdA is generally supportive of European integration. Although called the Labour Party, it has no formal links to the trade unions. In practice, however, strong links exist, with PvdA politicians often beginning their careers in the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]] trade union. The party is led by [[Lodewijk Asscher]]. The PvdA was a member of the [[Socialist International]] until it delisted in 2014.<ref>[https://www.pvda.nl/nieuws/pvda-steunt-oprichting-progressive-alliance]</ref>\n* The [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) is a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> and [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]]<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/nl/essentials_moving_to/country_facts/Whats-liberal-politics-in-the-Netherlands_16192.html What's liberal politics in the Netherlands?]</ref> party. It was founded by [[Geert Wilders]], who split from the VVD in 2004. The PVV seeks to lower taxation. It is [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptical]] and seeks to limit immigration, especially from Islamic and non-Western countries.\n* The [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] is a [[Christian Democracy in the Netherlands|Christian democratic]] party on the centre to centre-right.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> It supports free enterprise and holds to the principle that government activity should supplement but not supplant communal action by citizens. On the political spectrum, the CDA sees its philosophy as standing between the \"[[individualism]]\" of the VVD and the \"[[statism]]\" of the Labour Party. The CDA favours European economic, cultural, and political integration. The party is led by [[Sybrand van Haersma Buma]]. The CDA is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]].\n* The [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP) is a [[left-wing populism|left-wing populist]] party.<ref>{{cite book |title= Governance and politics of the Netherlands |last= Andeweg |first= R.

Irwin  |year= 2002 |location = Basingstoke |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 0333961579 |page= 51 |accessdate=}}</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, it was a [[Maoism|Maoist]] party supported by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). But in 1991 the SP dropped its Communist course, and chose a more independent and less radical [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> course, having long since denounced Maoism and the PRC. The party itself has called it a move \"from socialism to a social-ism.\" The party opposes what it sees as the [[European Superstate]]. The SP operates as an independent party within the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] in the European Parliament. [[Lilian Marijnissen]] is the leader of the SP.\n* [[GreenLeft]] combines [[green politics]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> with left-wing ideals. The party was founded in 1989 as a merger of the [[Political Party of Radicals|Radical]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party|Pacifist]], [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communist]], and [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical Left]] parties. It is led by [[Jesse Klaver]]. GreenLeft is a member of the [[Global Greens]].\n* The [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] (CU) is a [[social conservativism|socially conservative]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> Christian democratic party, which mostly concentrates on ethical issues, such as a resistance against abortion, [[euthanasia]], and [[gay marriage]]. In other areas (e.g. immigration and the environment), the party often is closer to the left-wing parties. It is sceptical about European integration. The CU operates within the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] group within the European Parliament and is a founding member of the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. [[Gert-Jan Segers]] leads the party.\n* [[Democrats 66]] (D66) has had widely fluctuating electoral fortunes since the party's founding in 1966. It is a centrist [[Social liberalism|social liberal]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/><ref name=\"almeida\"/> party, professing a [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] platform of ethnic and religious tolerance. [[Rob Jetten]] leads the party. D66 is a member of the [[Liberal International]].\n* [[Party for the Animals]] (PvdD) is an animal rights party, which can be labeled as a one issue-party, though it claims not to be. The focus of the party is on animal welfare, protecting the environment and conservation. The party also has distinctive points of view about education, privacy, health care and the economy. Its founder and leader is [[Marianne Thieme]].\n* The [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) is a party of the [[Christian right]],<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> with stronger ethical points of view than the ChristianUnion. Although a small party on a national level, it is an important political power in some orthodox reformed municipalities. The party sees governments (local, regional, national and international) as unconditional servants of God. The party bases all of its views directly on the Bible. The party opposes European integration and operates within the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] group and is a member of the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. [[Kees van der Staaij]] leads the SGP.\n* [[50Plus]] (50+) is a [[Pensioners' Party]]. It is led by [[Henk Krol]].\n* [[Denk (political party)|Denk]], a small political party mainly focusing on and promoting multiculturalism and social integration. The party also supports environmentalism and international justice. [[Tunahan Kuzu]] founded the party after splitting from the PvdA in 2014.\n* [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]], a right-wing, national conservative party. In favour of lower taxes, military investment and expansion, electoral reform, offering a referendum on European Union membership, reinstating border controls and ending what it perceives as mass immigration. The party was founded and is led by [[Thierry Baudet]].\n* The [[Independent Senate Group]] (OSF) is a parliamentary party in the Dutch Senate with one senator, representing several provincial parties.\n\n==Parliamentary parties==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=14|Political parties represented in the [[States General of the Netherlands]]\n|-\n!colspan=4|[[Political party]]\n![[List of political ideologies|Ideology]]\n![[Political spectrum|Political <br/> position]]\n![[European Union|European Union <br/> position]]\n![[European political party|European <br/> affiliation]]\n![[Political groups of the European Parliament|EP group]]\n![[Political international|International <br/> affiliation]]\n![[Party leader|Leader]]\n![[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]\n![[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House]]\n![[European Parliament|EP]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{People's Party for Freedom and Democracy/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[File:Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (nl) Logo.svg|100x100px|People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]\n| [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|People's Party for <br/> Freedom and Democracy]] <br/> {{small|(''Volkspartij voor <br/> Vrijheid en Democratie'')}}\n| '''VVD'''\n| {{Nowrap|[[Conservative liberalism]]<br/><ref name=\"Andeweg, R p.49\">[[Rudy Andeweg|Andeweg, R.]] and G.

There is no threshold for getting a seat, making it possible for a party to get a seat with only two-thirds percent of the vote\u2014roughly one seat for every 67,000 votes.\n\nNo party has won a majority of seats since the [[1894 Dutch general election|election of 1894]]<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip St\u00f6ver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1412 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>, and no party has even approached the seats needed for a majority since the current proportional representation system was [[1918 Dutch general election|implemented in 1918]]. All Dutch governments since then have been coalitions between two or more parties.  However, there is a broad consensus on the basic principles of the political system, and all parties must adjust their goals to some extent in order to have a realistic chance at being part of the government.\n\n==General overview==\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}\n* The [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is a [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] party.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> As a centre-right movement, it attaches great importance to [[private enterprise]], [[market liberalism]]<ref name=\"almeida\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/europe/conferences/tgsw/documents/TGSW_Almeida_Paper.pdf |title=Liberal Parties and European Integration |last=Almeida |first=Dimitri}}</ref> and the freedom of the individual in political, social, and economic affairs. The party is generally supportive of European economic integration, but is less supportive of political integration. The party's leader is [[Mark Rutte]]. VVD is a member of the [[Liberal International]] and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]].\n* The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party, and centre-left in orientation.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> Its program is based on more social, political, and economic equality for all citizens. Former PvdA-prime minister [[Joop den Uyl]] has called it an \"equal distribution of knowledge, income and power.\" In recent years the PvdA has espoused a centrist [[Third Way]] programme. The PvdA is generally supportive of European integration. Although called the Labour Party, it has no formal links to the trade unions. In practice, however, strong links exist, with PvdA politicians often beginning their careers in the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]] trade union. The party is led by [[Lodewijk Asscher]]. The PvdA was a member of the [[Socialist International]] until it delisted in 2014.<ref>[https://www.pvda.nl/nieuws/pvda-steunt-oprichting-progressive-alliance]</ref>\n* The [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) is a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> and [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]]<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/nl/essentials_moving_to/country_facts/Whats-liberal-politics-in-the-Netherlands_16192.html What's liberal politics in the Netherlands?]</ref> party. It was founded by [[Geert Wilders]], who split from the VVD in 2004. The PVV seeks to lower taxation. It is [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptical]] and seeks to limit immigration, especially from Islamic and non-Western countries.\n* The [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] is a [[Christian Democracy in the Netherlands|Christian democratic]] party on the centre to centre-right.<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> It supports free enterprise and holds to the principle that government activity should supplement but not supplant communal action by citizens. On the political spectrum, the CDA sees its philosophy as standing between the \"[[individualism]]\" of the VVD and the \"[[statism]]\" of the Labour Party. The CDA favours European economic, cultural, and political integration. The party is led by [[Sybrand van Haersma Buma]]. The CDA is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]].\n* The [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP) is a [[left-wing populism|left-wing populist]] party.<ref>{{cite book |title= Governance and politics of the Netherlands |last= Andeweg |first= R.

Irwin  |year= 2002 |location = Basingstoke |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 0333961579 |page= 51 |accessdate=}}</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, it was a [[Maoism|Maoist]] party supported by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). But in 1991 the SP dropped its Communist course, and chose a more independent and less radical [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> course, having long since denounced Maoism and the PRC. The party itself has called it a move \"from socialism to a social-ism.\" The party opposes what it sees as the [[European Superstate]]. The SP operates as an independent party within the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] in the European Parliament. [[Lilian Marijnissen]] is the leader of the SP.\n* [[GreenLeft]] combines [[green politics]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> with left-wing ideals. The party was founded in 1989 as a merger of the [[Political Party of Radicals|Radical]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party|Pacifist]], [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communist]], and [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical Left]] parties. It is led by [[Jesse Klaver]]. GreenLeft is a member of the [[Global Greens]].\n* The [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] (CU) is a [[social conservativism|socially conservative]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> Christian democratic party, which mostly concentrates on ethical issues, such as a resistance against abortion, [[euthanasia]], and [[gay marriage]]. In other areas (e.g. immigration and the environment), the party often is closer to the left-wing parties. It is sceptical about European integration. The CU operates within the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] group within the European Parliament and is a founding member of the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. [[Gert-Jan Segers]] leads the party.\n* [[Democrats 66]] (D66) has had widely fluctuating electoral fortunes since the party's founding in 1966. It is a centrist [[Social liberalism|social liberal]]<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/><ref name=\"almeida\"/> party, professing a [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] platform of ethnic and religious tolerance. [[Rob Jetten]] leads the party. D66 is a member of the [[Liberal International]].\n* [[Party for the Animals]] (PvdD) is an animal rights party, which can be labeled as a one issue-party, though it claims not to be. The focus of the party is on animal welfare, protecting the environment and conservation. The party also has distinctive points of view about education, privacy, health care and the economy. Its founder and leader is [[Marianne Thieme]].\n* The [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) is a party of the [[Christian right]],<ref name=\"Nordsieck\"/> with stronger ethical points of view than the ChristianUnion. Although a small party on a national level, it is an important political power in some orthodox reformed municipalities. The party sees governments (local, regional, national and international) as unconditional servants of God. The party bases all of its views directly on the Bible. The party opposes European integration and operates within the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] group and is a member of the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. [[Kees van der Staaij]] leads the SGP.\n* [[50Plus]] (50+) is a [[Pensioners' Party]]. It is led by [[Henk Krol]].\n* [[Denk (political party)|Denk]], a small political party mainly focusing on and promoting multiculturalism and social integration. The party also supports environmentalism and international justice. [[Tunahan Kuzu]] founded the party after splitting from the PvdA in 2014.\n* [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]], a right-wing, national conservative party. In favour of lower taxes, military investment and expansion, electoral reform, offering a referendum on European Union membership, reinstating border controls and ending what it perceives as mass immigration. The party was founded and is led by [[Thierry Baudet]].\n* The [[Independent Senate Group]] (OSF) is a parliamentary party in the Dutch Senate with one senator, representing several provincial parties.\n\n==Parliamentary parties==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=14|Political parties represented in the [[States General of the Netherlands]]\n|-\n!colspan=4|[[Political party]]\n![[List of political ideologies|Ideology]]\n![[Political spectrum|Political <br/> position]]\n![[European Union|European Union <br/> position]]\n![[European political party|European <br/> affiliation]]\n![[Political groups of the European Parliament|EP group]]\n![[Political international|International <br/> affiliation]]\n![[Party leader|Leader]]\n![[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]\n![[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House]]\n![[European Parliament|EP]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{People's Party for Freedom and Democracy/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[File:Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (nl) Logo.svg|100x100px|People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]\n| [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|People's Party for <br/> Freedom and Democracy]] <br/> {{small|(''Volkspartij voor <br/> Vrijheid en Democratie'')}}\n| '''VVD'''\n| {{Nowrap|[[Conservative liberalism]]<br/><ref name=\"Andeweg, R p.49\">[[Rudy Andeweg|Andeweg, R.]] and G.
