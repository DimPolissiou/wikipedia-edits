Dan Dare has been described as \"[[Biggles]] in Space\" and as the British equivalent of [[Buck Rogers]]. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated [[comic-strip]] artwork by Hampson and other artists, including [[Harold Johns (artist)|Harold Johns]], [[Don Harley]], [[Bruce Cornwell]], [[Greta Tomlinson]], [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]].\n\n''Dan Dare'' returned in new strips in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched ''Eagle'' in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by [[Virgin Comics]] in 2007 and 2008.  It was written by [[Garth Ennis]] and illustrated by [[Gary Erskine]] and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in ''[[Spaceship Away]]'', a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original ''Eagle'' left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===''Eagle''===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Dan Dare - Operation Moss comic panel.png|thumb|A Frank Hampson & Don Harley page from the 1959 ''Eagle Annual No. 8'': Dan Dare in ''Operation Moss'']] -->\nDan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]]. The Eagle's founder, the Rev [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|John Marcus Harston Morris]], was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of [[spaceships]], and [[model (art)|models]] in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, ''Eagle'' incorporated \"[[centrefold]]s\" of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan's ship the ''Anastasia'', reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even in ''Eagle'' itself.  The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/secret-history-dan-dare-manchesters-12895375|title=The secret history of Dan Dare, Manchester's own comic book hero|first=Paul|last=Britton|date=April 14, 2017|website=men}}</ref> Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson's house in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], where his production line techniques were continued.\n\nAttention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer [[Arthur C.

The stories were set mostly on planets of the [[Solar System]] presumed to have [[extraterrestrial life]] and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to [[Venus]].\n\nHampson's working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of \"Marooned on Mercury\" (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by [[Samaritans]] founder and clergyman Rev. [[Chad Varah]], who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, \"Operation Saturn\" (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant [[Don Harley]], who completed the story and its successor, \"Prisoners of Space\" (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by [[Desmond Walduck]].\n\nHampson returned full-time in 1955, starting \"The Man from Nowhere\" trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time.\n\nThe quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties ''Eagle'''s new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to [[Frank Bellamy]], whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell.\n\n====Characters====\nDan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially:\n* '''Dan Dare''' (full name [[Colonel]] Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in [[Manchester]], England, in 1967 and educated at [[Rossall School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandare.org.uk/DanDareWho1.htm|title=DanDare.org.uk - 1950's and 60's Who's Who (Transcribed)|website=www.dandare.org.uk}}</ref> Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at [[jujutsu]], but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word.\n:His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his [[eyebrows]], which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical [[British Army]] type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a [[chaplain]].\n* '''Digby''' (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan's [[Wigan]]-born [[Batman (army)|batman]]. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food.  His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship.\n* '''Sir Hubert Guest''', Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson's father.\n* '''Professor Peabody''' (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team's most inventive plans.\n* '''Hank Hogan''' and '''Pierre Lafayette''', stereotypically [[United States|American]] and [[France|French]], were two of the Fleet's best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic.\n* '''Sondar''' was a [[Treens|Treen]], a reptilian inhabitant of northern [[Venus]]. Originally a servant of [[the Mekon]], he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed.  He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under [[United Nations|UN]] rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan's personal spaceship.\n* '''[[The Mekon]]''', super-intelligent ruler of the [[Treens]], was Dan's archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth.\n* '''Christopher 'Flamer' Spry''', freckle-faced student at 'Astral' space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson's son, Peter Hampson.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7376571.stm Dan Dare 'inspired UK innovation'] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>\n* '''Lex O'Malley''', bearded [[Irish people|Irish]] [[submarine]] commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions.\n\nWith the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O'Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances.  In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run.\n\n*'''Colonel Wilf Banger''', handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit.\n*'''Technician Nutter Cobb''', red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger's assistant, a Digby to his Dare.\n*'''Major Shillitoe Spence''', balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator.\n*'''Xel''',  first encountered in ''Operation Time Trap'' in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon.  Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out.  Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured.\n\n====Vehicles====\n[[Spacecraft]] of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged ''Anastasia''. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the ''Zyl-bat''. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called ''Tempus Frangit'' ([[Latin]]: ''it breaks time'' or ''time breaks'').\n\nThere were land and air vehicles \u2013 in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of [[helicopter]]s of the mid-twentieth century.  Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the ''Poseidon'', a versatile craft that could operate as a [[jetfoil]] as well as a submarine.\n\n[[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] used overhead [[monorail]]s and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with [[gyroscopes]] and single wheels.\n\nVenusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel.\n\n====Spaceports====\nThere is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of [[Formby]] in [[Lancashire]] on a semicircle of land built into the [[Irish Sea]] by [[landfill]].\n\n====Spacesuits====\nSpacefleet spacesuits had a [[corselet plate]] like on [[Siebe Gorman]] [[standard diving suit]]s. Their suit had no [[life-support]] backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet.\n\nAll or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet [[spacesuit]]s in space hang in folds like the [[boilersuit]] in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or [[Therons|Theron]] design.\n\nSome other spacesuits such as Blasco's have life-support backpacks.\n\n====The 1960s====\nIn 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]], [[Gerald Palmer (comics)|Gerald Palmer]], with [[Bruce Cornwell]], and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when ''Eagle'' merged with ''[[Lion (comic)|Lion]]''. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in ''Lion''.\n\n===''2000 AD''===\nIn 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' (26 February 1977). The first instalment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and [[Pat Mills]], had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement, as was much of ''2000 AD'') and the personality of the title character. Written by [[Kelvin Gosnell]] and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by [[Massimo Bellardinelli]], whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]]. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' but with technology designs very much influenced by ''[[Star Wars]]''. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the \"Star Slayers\" \u2013 the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage.\n\nThe strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in ''2000 AD'''s 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon's army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by [[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]] but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the ''2000 AD'' Dan Dare strip \"Attack on Eternium\" ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979).\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of ''2000 AD'', which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called ''3000 AD'' which contained strips partially based on the first issue of ''2000 AD''. One strip was entitled \"The Return of Dan Dare\", which also featured the return of the Mekon.\n\n===The new ''Eagle''===\nIn 1982 ''Eagle'' was re-launched, with ''Dan Dare'' again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-great-grandson of the original hero\u2014the only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was [[Gerry Embleton]], who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]], who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair.\n\nThe opening ''Dan Dare'' story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by [[Pat Mills]] and [[John Wagner]]. It opened with a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial [[asteroid]] and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which [[retcon]]ned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original ''Eagle'' took place\u2014an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life.\n\nAfter this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories.\n\nIn 1987 the strip became more like a [[space opera]], with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by [[Judge Dredd]].\n\nThe original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s ''Eagle'', was revived in 1989, with artist [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]]  providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on ''Dan Dare'' from 1962 to 1967. The new ''Eagle'' ended in 1994.\n\n===''Revolver''===\nIn 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialised in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in ''[[Crisis (Fleetway)|Crisis]]'', following ''Revolver'''s cancellation.\n\n===''The Planet''===\nIn 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, \"Remembrance\", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.\n\n===Virgin Comics===\nIn 2007\u20132008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.2000ad.nu/|title=2000ad.nu|website=www.2000ad.nu}}</ref>  Virgin's founder and chairman [[Richard Branson]] is a fan of the character.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970907.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 Virgin takes up 'Dare'], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], August 26, 2007</ref> The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.\n\n===''Spaceship Away''===\nLaunched in October 2003, [http://www.spaceshipaway.org.uk Spaceship Away] magazine was originally created in order to get \"The Phoenix Mission\" (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine's continuation following that strip's conclusion, initially with \"Green Nemesis\" (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth. Other stories have since followed.\n\nDespite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), ''Spaceship Away'' continues to appear three times a year.\n\n===Titan Comics===\nIn 2017\u201318 a four-issue mini-series by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Alberto Foche]] was published  by [[Titan Comics]].<ref>\"Dare to be Different\" by Stephen Jewell, ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #390, 2017</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Radio Luxembourg serial====\n[[Image:dandare.jpg|thumb|This ad for the Dan Dare ''pilot of the future'' serial appeared in the '''[[Radio Luxembourg (English)|208]]''' magazine in March 1952]]\n''The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future'' aired five times a week on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for five years from 2 July 1951.

One example is Wing Commander Leyton in ''British Summertime'' by [[Paul Cornell]], which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today.\n\nIn the 1980s, ''[[Private Eye]]'' published ''Dan Dire, Pilot of Future?''. Dire was based on politician [[Neil Kinnock]], the question being whether he'd ever become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Dire's enemy was the Maggon, a combination of [[the Mekon]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>'Sufferin' Satellites, Dan Dare is Back!', [[the Independent]], 14 April 1990</ref>\n\nRadio DJ and Comedian [[Kenny Everett]]'s character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare.\n\nA porcine pastiche, ''[[Ham Dare: Pig of the Future]]'', written by [[Lew Stringer]] and with art by [[Malcolm Douglas (illustrator)|Malcolm Douglas]], appeared in ''[[Oink! (comic)|Oink!]]'' comic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ham-dare/4005-87799/|title=Ham Dare (Character)|website=Comic Vine}}</ref>\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] created a Dan Dare-esque character in their [[Captain Britain]] line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] heroes killed by [[Fury (Marvel comics)|The Fury]].\n\nIn [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' series, the character [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]]'s secret identity is astronomer Isabel 'Izzy' Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him.  He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with [[Captain America]].  The card reveals the grandfather's name as Dan.  In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy's last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel's Captain Terror.\n\nIn his Afterword to ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', [[Warren Ellis]] lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of ''Ministry of Space'', is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.<ref>Ellis, W: \"Ministry Of Space\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Jack Harkness]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode \"[[The Empty Child]]\" in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having \"the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Doctor Who: The Shooting Scripts\n  | publisher = [[BBC Books]]\n  | year = 2005\n  | location =\n  | page = 323\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-563-48641-1}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\nMost of the 1950s and 1960s strips were reprinted by [[Hawk Books]] between 1987 and 1995.\n# ''Pilot of the Future''\n# ''[[The Red Moon Mystery]]'' and ''[[Marooned on Mercury]]''\n# ''[[Operation Saturn (Dan Dare)|Operation Saturn]]''\n# ''[[Prisoners of Space]]''\n# ''[[The Man from Nowhere (comics)|The Man from Nowhere]]''\n# ''[[Rogue Planet (Dan Dare)|Rogue Planet]]''\n# ''Reign of the Robots'' and ''The Ship That Lived''\n# ''The Phantom Fleet''\n# ''Terra Nova'' trilogy\n# ''Project Nimbus''\n# ''Solid Space Mystery''\n# ''The Final Volume''\n\nStories left out were :\n* ''Operation Earthsavers'' (v13, 10\u201323)\n* ''The Evil One'' (v13, 24\u201332)\n* ''Operation Fireball'' (v13, 33\u201342)\n* ''The Web of Fear'' (v13, 43\u201352)\n* ''Operation Dark Star'' (v14, 1\u20139)\n* ''Operation Time Trap'' (v14, 10\u201338)\n* ''The Wandering World'' (v14, 39 \u2013 v15, 13)\n* ''The Big City Caper'' (v15, 14\u201322)\n* ''The Singing Scourge'' (v16, 30 \u2013 v17, 6)\n* ''Give Me The Moon'' (v17, 7\u201326)\n\nIn 2004, [[Titan Books]] began collecting the series from the beginning of the Hampson run in dust-jacketed hardback editions.

Dan Dare has been described as \"[[Biggles]] in Space\" and as the British equivalent of [[Buck Rogers]]. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated [[comic-strip]] artwork by Hampson and other artists, including [[Harold Johns (artist)|Harold Johns]], [[Don Harley]], [[Bruce Cornwell]], [[Greta Tomlinson]], [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]].\n\n''Dan Dare'' returned in new strips in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched ''Eagle'' in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by [[Virgin Comics]] in 2007 and 2008.  It was written by [[Garth Ennis]] and illustrated by [[Gary Erskine]] and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in ''[[Spaceship Away]]'', a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original ''Eagle'' left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===''Eagle''===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Dan Dare - Operation Moss comic panel.png|thumb|A Frank Hampson & Don Harley page from the 1959 ''Eagle Annual No. 8'': Dan Dare in ''Operation Moss'']] -->\nDan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]]. The Eagle's founder, the Rev [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|John Marcus Harston Morris]], was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of [[spaceships]], and [[model (art)|models]] in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, ''Eagle'' incorporated \"[[centrefold]]s\" of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan's ship the ''Anastasia'', reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even ''Eagle'' itself.  The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/secret-history-dan-dare-manchesters-12895375|title=The secret history of Dan Dare, Manchester's own comic book hero|first=Paul|last=Britton|date=April 14, 2017|website=men}}</ref> Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson's house in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], where his production line techniques were continued.\n\nAttention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer [[Arthur C.

The stories were set mostly on planets of the [[Solar System]] presumed to have [[extraterrestrial life]] and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to [[Venus]].\n\nHampson's working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of \"Marooned on Mercury\" (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by [[Samaritans]] founder and clergyman Rev. [[Chad Varah]], who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, \"Operation Saturn\" (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant [[Don Harley]], who completed the story and its successor, \"Prisoners of Space\" (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by [[Desmond Walduck]].\n\nHampson returned full-time in 1955, starting \"The Man from Nowhere\" trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time.\n\nThe quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties ''Eagle'''s new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to [[Frank Bellamy]], whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell.\n\n====Characters====\nDan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially:\n* '''Dan Dare''' (full name [[Colonel]] Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in [[Manchester]], England, in 1967 and educated at [[Rossall School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandare.org.uk/DanDareWho1.htm|title=DanDare.org.uk - 1950's and 60's Who's Who (Transcribed)|website=www.dandare.org.uk}}</ref> Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at [[jujutsu]], but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word.\n:His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his [[eyebrows]], which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical [[British Army]] type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a [[chaplain]].\n* '''Digby''' (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan's [[Wigan]]-born [[Batman (army)|batman]]. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food.  His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship.\n* '''Sir Hubert Guest''', Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson's father.\n* '''Professor Peabody''' (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team's most inventive plans.\n* '''Hank Hogan''' and '''Pierre Lafayette''', stereotypically [[United States|American]] and [[France|French]], were two of the Fleet's best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic.\n* '''Sondar''' was a [[Treens|Treen]], a reptilian inhabitant of northern [[Venus]]. Originally a servant of [[the Mekon]], he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed.  He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under [[United Nations|UN]] rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan's personal spaceship.\n* '''[[The Mekon]]''', super-intelligent ruler of the [[Treens]], was Dan's archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth.\n* '''Christopher 'Flamer' Spry''', freckle-faced student at 'Astral' space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson's son, Peter Hampson.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7376571.stm Dan Dare 'inspired UK innovation'] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>\n* '''Lex O'Malley''', bearded [[Irish people|Irish]] [[submarine]] commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions.\n\nWith the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O'Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances.  In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run.\n\n*'''Colonel Wilf Banger''', handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit.\n*'''Technician Nutter Cobb''', red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger's assistant, a Digby to his Dare.\n*'''Major Shillitoe Spence''', balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator.\n*'''Xel''',  first encountered in ''Operation Time Trap'' in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon.  Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out.  Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured.\n\n====Vehicles====\n[[Spacecraft]] of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged ''Anastasia''. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the ''Zyl-bat''. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called ''Tempus Frangit'' ([[Latin]]: ''it breaks time'' or ''time breaks'').\n\nThere were land and air vehicles \u2013 in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of [[helicopter]]s of the mid-twentieth century.  Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the ''Poseidon'', a versatile craft that could operate as a [[jetfoil]] as well as a submarine.\n\n[[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] used overhead [[monorail]]s and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with [[gyroscopes]] and single wheels.\n\nVenusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel.\n\n====Spaceports====\nThere is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of [[Formby]] in [[Lancashire]] on a semicircle of land built into the [[Irish Sea]] by [[landfill]].\n\n====Spacesuits====\nSpacefleet spacesuits had a [[corselet plate]] like on [[Siebe Gorman]] [[standard diving suit]]s. Their suit had no [[life-support]] backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet.\n\nAll or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet [[spacesuit]]s in space hang in folds like the [[boilersuit]] in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or [[Therons|Theron]] design.\n\nSome other spacesuits such as Blasco's have life-support backpacks.\n\n====The 1960s====\nIn 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]], [[Gerald Palmer (comics)|Gerald Palmer]], with [[Bruce Cornwell]], and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when ''Eagle'' merged with ''[[Lion (comic)|Lion]]''. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in ''Lion''.\n\n===''2000 AD''===\nIn 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' (26 February 1977). The first instalment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and [[Pat Mills]], had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement, as was much of ''2000 AD'') and the personality of the title character. Written by [[Kelvin Gosnell]] and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by [[Massimo Bellardinelli]], whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]]. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' but with technology designs very much influenced by ''[[Star Wars]]''. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the \"Star Slayers\" \u2013 the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage.\n\nThe strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in ''2000 AD'''s 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon's army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by [[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]] but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the ''2000 AD'' Dan Dare strip \"Attack on Eternium\" ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979).\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of ''2000 AD'', which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called ''3000 AD'' which contained strips partially based on the first issue of ''2000 AD''. One strip was entitled \"The Return of Dan Dare\", which also featured the return of the Mekon.\n\n===The new ''Eagle''===\nIn 1982 ''Eagle'' was re-launched, with ''Dan Dare'' again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-great-grandson of the original hero\u2014the only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was [[Gerry Embleton]], who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]], who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair.\n\nThe opening ''Dan Dare'' story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by [[Pat Mills]] and [[John Wagner]]. It opened with a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial [[asteroid]] and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which [[retcon]]ned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original ''Eagle'' took place\u2014an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life.\n\nAfter this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories.\n\nIn 1987 the strip became more like a [[space opera]], with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by [[Judge Dredd]].\n\nThe original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s ''Eagle'', was revived in 1989, with artist [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]]  providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on ''Dan Dare'' from 1962 to 1967. The new ''Eagle'' ended in 1994.\n\n===''Revolver''===\nIn 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialised in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in ''[[Crisis (Fleetway)|Crisis]]'', following ''Revolver'''s cancellation.\n\n===''The Planet''===\nIn 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, \"Remembrance\", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.\n\n===Virgin Comics===\nIn 2007\u20132008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.2000ad.nu/|title=2000ad.nu|website=www.2000ad.nu}}</ref>  Virgin's founder and chairman [[Richard Branson]] is a fan of the character.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970907.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 Virgin takes up 'Dare'], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], August 26, 2007</ref> The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.\n\n===''Spaceship Away''===\nLaunched in October 2003, [http://www.spaceshipaway.org.uk Spaceship Away] magazine was originally created in order to get \"The Phoenix Mission\" (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine's continuation following that strip's conclusion, initially with \"Green Nemesis\" (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth. Other stories have since followed.\n\nDespite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), ''Spaceship Away'' continues to appear three times a year.\n\n===Titan Comics===\nIn 2017\u201318 a four-issue mini-series by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Alberto Foche]] was published  by [[Titan Comics]].<ref>\"Dare to be Different\" by Stephen Jewell, ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #390, 2017</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Radio Luxembourg serial====\n[[Image:dandare.jpg|thumb|This ad for the Dan Dare ''pilot of the future'' serial appeared in the '''[[Radio Luxembourg (English)|208]]''' magazine in March 1952]]\n''The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future'' aired five times a week on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for five years from 2 July 1951.

The dialogue was straight from wartime upper class RAF officers' slang.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future (TV Series)|Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' became a [[3D computer graphics|computer-generated]] TV series produced first by [[Netter Digital]] then by [[Foundation Imaging]], running to twenty-six 22-minute episodes. The series drew on several comic book incarnations. It started on [[Nicktoons UK]] on 5 November 2005 at 6.30&nbsp;pm. Two abortive attempts had been made to make a live-action series, in 1981 and 1991. [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] and [[Robert Bathurst]] were reportedly lined up to play Dare respectively. In 1991 a short pilot starring Bathurst as Dare, and [[Geoffrey Hughes]] as Digby was made.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Dare Remembered |author=John Freeman |work=Down The Tubes |url=http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044443/http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |archivedate=May 2, 2012 }}</ref> Parts of it were broadcast in an ITV documentary, ''Future Perfect''.\n\n===Film===\nIn 2010, [[Variety.com|Variety]] announced that [[Warner Bros.]] was planning to produce a Dan Dare movie starring [[Sam Worthington]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Warner Bros. takes on space 'Dare'|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/warner-bros-takes-on-space-dare-1118022089/|website=Variety.com|accessdate=12 May 2016|date=2010-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Computer games===\nDuring the 1980s Dan Dare starred in three computer games for the [[Commodore 64]]/128, [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari]] computers. The first was a different game on each system; the second and third were shoot'em-ups. All three were based on the 1950s strip rather than the contemporary comics.\n\n*''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' (1986, Electronic Arts, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare II: The Mekon's Revenge'' (1988, Virgin Games, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare III: The Escape'' (1990, Virgin Games)\n\n===Music===\n[[Pink Floyd]] founder [[Syd Barrett]] wrote Dan Dare into his song \"Astronomy Domine\", from the band's debut album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', with the line \"Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?\"\n\n[[David Bowie]]'s song \"D.J.\" contains the somewhat obscure lyric: \"I feel like Dan Dare lies down\"\n\nSir [[Elton John]] recorded \"Dan Dare (Pilot Of The Future)\" for his 1975 album ''Rock Of The Westies''.\n\nBritish punk rock group The Mekons included a song \"Dan Dare\" on their album ''The Quality of Mercy is not Strnen''.\n \nThe album [[Below the Waste]] by the [[Art of Noise]] opened with the song \"Dan Dare\"\n\nThe relaunch of the [[Eagle Magazine]] in 1982 saw a free single giveaway of a track called ''Dan Dare'' by the group Loose Talk.\n\n==Characters inspired by Dan Dare==\nCharacters inspired by or based on Dan Dare have appeared throughout British popular culture. One example is Wing Commander Leyton in ''British Summertime'' by [[Paul Cornell]], which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today.\n\nIn the 1980s, ''[[Private Eye]]'' published ''Dan Dire, Pilot of Future?''. Dire was based on politician [[Neil Kinnock]], the question being whether he'd ever become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Dire's enemy was the Maggon, a combination of [[the Mekon]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>'Sufferin' Satellites, Dan Dare is Back!', [[the Independent]], 14 April 1990</ref>\n\nRadio DJ and Comedian [[Kenny Everett]]'s character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare.\n\nA porcine pastiche, ''[[Ham Dare: Pig of the Future]]'', written by [[Lew Stringer]] and with art by [[Malcolm Douglas (illustrator)|Malcolm Douglas]], appeared in ''[[Oink! (comic)|Oink!]]'' comic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ham-dare/4005-87799/|title=Ham Dare (Character)|website=Comic Vine}}</ref>\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] created a Dan Dare-esque character in their [[Captain Britain]] line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] heroes killed by [[Fury (Marvel comics)|The Fury]].\n\nIn [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' series, the character [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]]'s secret identity is astronomer Isabel 'Izzy' Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him.  He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with [[Captain America]].  The card reveals the grandfather's name as Dan.  In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy's last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel's Captain Terror.\n\nIn his Afterword to ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', [[Warren Ellis]] lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of ''Ministry of Space'', is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.<ref>Ellis, W: \"Ministry Of Space\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Jack Harkness]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode \"[[The Empty Child]]\" in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having \"the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Doctor Who: The Shooting Scripts\n  | publisher = [[BBC Books]]\n  | year = 2005\n  | location =\n  | page = 323\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-563-48641-1}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\nMost of the 1950s and 1960s strips were reprinted by [[Hawk Books]] between 1987 and 1995.\n# ''Pilot of the Future''\n# ''[[The Red Moon Mystery]]'' and ''[[Marooned on Mercury]]''\n# ''[[Operation Saturn (Dan Dare)|Operation Saturn]]''\n# ''[[Prisoners of Space]]''\n# ''[[The Man from Nowhere (comics)|The Man from Nowhere]]''\n# ''[[Rogue Planet (Dan Dare)|Rogue Planet]]''\n# ''Reign of the Robots'' and ''The Ship That Lived''\n# ''The Phantom Fleet''\n# ''Terra Nova'' trilogy\n# ''Project Nimbus''\n# ''Solid Space Mystery''\n# ''The Final Volume''\n\nStories left out were :\n* ''Operation Earthsavers'' (v13, 10\u201323)\n* ''The Evil One'' (v13, 24\u201332)\n* ''Operation Fireball'' (v13, 33\u201342)\n* ''The Web of Fear'' (v13, 43\u201352)\n* ''Operation Dark Star'' (v14, 1\u20139)\n* ''Operation Time Trap'' (v14, 10\u201338)\n* ''The Wandering World'' (v14, 39 \u2013 v15, 13)\n* ''The Big City Caper'' (v15, 14\u201322)\n* ''The Singing Scourge'' (v16, 30 \u2013 v17, 6)\n* ''Give Me The Moon'' (v17, 7\u201326)\n\nIn 2004, [[Titan Books]] began collecting the series from the beginning of the Hampson run in dust-jacketed hardback editions.

He is the founder of the [[Mizo National Front]].\n\nOriginally a [[Havildar]] in the [[Indian Army]], Laldenga later worked as an Accounts Clerk in the [[Government of Assam]]. Disappointed by the Government's indifference to the severe famine in the [[Mizo district]] in the late 1950s, he rebelled against the Government. As a leader of the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), he led a [[secessionist]] war seeking Mizo territory's independence from [[India]]. He was captured many times, and spent most of his time in exile in [[Bangladesh]]. The [[guerrilla]] movement lasted for sixteen years till the [[Mizo Accord]] was signed in 1986, by which he became the Chief Minister. He won the first [[Mizoram Legislative Assembly]] election under statehood in 1987, and continued at the Chief Minister office for another year. He died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990.\n\n==Early years==\n\nBorn on Sunday, the 12th June, 1927, Laldenga the fourth child of a cultivator Liantlira Ralte and Darchhungi Hnamte, hailed from Pukpui Village in the Mizo district of Assam\n\n( \n\n\n(now in the [[Lunglei district]] of Mizoram). He joined the Indian Army and served up to [[Havildar]]. He resigned from the army and joined civil service as Accounts Clerk under District Council office in [[Aizawl]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pachuau |first1=Joy |title=The Camera as a Witness |publisher=Cambridge |isbn=9781107073395 |pages=302}}</ref>\n\n==Secessionist movement==\nLaldenga joined a voluntary organisation called Mizo Cultural Society, formed in 1955, as its Secretary. The society became Mautam Front in March 1960 to work for relief due to the [[Mautam]] famine that affected the entire Mizoram (which was then a district council of Assam). The government could not make efficient effort to provide basic survival needs, and this prompted the need for more powerful pressure group. The organisation was then renamed Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF) in September 1960. This soon evolved into a political organisation and ultimately became the Mizo National Front (MNF) on 22 October 1961. Laldenga took the support from [[Pakistan]] for the separatist movement and was arrested and jailed by Indian authorities. As an outcome of his talks, between 1963 and 1966 East Pakistan provided military training and shelter to Mizo fighters when they needed exile <ref>{{cite book |last1=Pachuau |first1=Joy |title=The Camera as a Witness |publisher=Cambridge |isbn=9781107073395 |pages=323}}</ref>..\n\nOn the night of 28 February 1966, the MNF launched an daring and ambitious attack on the district's major towns, resulting in the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising]]. It declared independence and called on the [[Mizo people|Mizos]] to rise against India. The Indian Government responded by sending troops and aircraft on bombing missions. Villagers were uprooted from the hills and sent without their consent to Regrouped Villages built along the highways. For the next 20 years, violence continued in the Mizo hills with the fighters camping in Mizoram (India) and [[East Pakistan]]. With the fall of East Pakistan in 1971, Laldenga's men scattered to [[Myanmar]] while he moved to Pakistan. After secret meetings in Europe with Indian officials, he returned seeking a peaceful resolution of the problem.<ref name=nic>{{cite web|title=About Mizoram - History|url=http://www.mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm|publisher=National Informatics Centre, Mizoram State Centre|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring his guerrilla life, Laldenga was arrested on several occasions and spent 10 years in exile, mostly in Bangladesh and [[Pakistan]].<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|title=Laldenga, Tribal Leader in India, 53|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/obituaries/laldenga-tribal-leader-in-india-53.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=8 July 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Peace Accord and last days==\n\nWhen [[Rajiv Gandhi]] became the [[Prime Minister of India]] in 1984, it encouraged a new wave of negotiation.

He is the founder of the [[Mizo National Front]].\n\nOriginally a [[Havildar]] in the [[Indian Army]], Laldenga later worked as an Accounts Clerk in the [[Government of Assam]]. Disappointed by the Government's indifference to the severe famine in the [[Mizo district]] in the late 1950s, he rebelled against the Government. As a leader of the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), he led a [[secessionist]] war seeking Mizo territory's independence from [[India]]. He was captured many times, and spent most of his time in exile in [[Bangladesh]]. The [[guerrilla]] movement lasted for sixteen years till the [[Mizo Accord]] was signed in 1986, by which he became the Chief Minister. He won the first [[Mizoram Legislative Assembly]] election under statehood in 1987, and continued at the Chief Minister office for another year. He died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990.\n\n==Early years==\n\nLaldenga was born on 11 June 1927 in village Pukpui in the Mizo district of Assam (now in the [[Lunglei district]] of Mizoram).
