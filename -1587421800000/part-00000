Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue. Tin, like [[indium]], is soft enough to be cut without much force.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Theodore |url=http://www.theodoregray.com/Periodictable/Ref/050/index.html |work=The Elements |title=Tin images |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal |date=2007}}</ref> When a bar of tin is bent, the so-called \u201c[[tin cry]]\u201d can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming; this trait is shared by indium, [[cadmium]], and frozen [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals. However, in most tin [[alloy]]s (such as [[pewter]]), the metal solidifies with a dull gray color. Tin is a [[post-transition metal]] in [[group 14]] of the [[periodic table of elements]]. It is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], which contains [[tin dioxide|stannic oxide]], SnO<sub>2</sub>. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, [[germanium]] and [[lead]], and has two main [[oxidation state]]s, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10&nbsp;stable isotopes, the largest number of stable [[isotope]]s in the periodic table, thanks to its [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of protons. It has two main [[allotrope]]s: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin, a silvery-white, [[malleable]] metal, but at low temperatures, it transforms into the less dense grey \u03b1-tin, which has the [[diamond cubic]] structure. Metallic tin does not easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air.\n\nThe first tin alloy used on a large scale was [[bronze]], made of {{frac|1|8}}&nbsp;tin and {{frac|7|8}}&nbsp;[[copper]], from as early as 3000&nbsp;BC. After 600&nbsp;BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\u201390% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of [[copper]], [[antimony]], and lead, was used for [[tableware|flatware]] from the [[Bronze Age]] until the 20th&nbsp;century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft [[solder]]s, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of [[indium tin oxide]] in [[optoelectronic]] applications. Another large application for tin is [[corrosion]]-resistant [[tin plating]] of [[steel]]. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as [[tin can]]s. However, some [[Organotin chemistry|organotin compounds]] can be almost as toxic as [[cyanide]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical===\n[[File:Tin-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Drop (liquid)|Droplet]] of solidified molten tin]]\nTin is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and highly [[crystal]]line silvery-white [[metal]].

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the \"First International Tin Agreement\" in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the [[International Tin Council]] (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.<ref name=price/>\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981\u201382 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major \"tin crisis\" followed \u2014 tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s.<ref name=price>Carlin, James F., Jr. (1998).

Since the European Union [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE Directive) and [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] came into effect on 1 July 2006, the lead content in such alloys has decreased. Replacing lead has many problems, including a higher melting point, and the formation of [[Whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]] causing electrical problems. [[Tin pest]] can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are rapidly being found, although problems of joint integrity remain.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.113-a682| author = Black, Harvey|title = Getting the Lead Out of Electronics| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|volume = 113|issue = 10|date = 2005| pmid = 16203230| pages = A682\u20135| pmc = 1281311}}</ref>\n\n===Tin plating===\nTin bonds readily to [[iron]] and is used for coating [[lead]], zinc and steel to prevent corrosion.

The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead phase solidifies first, then when the eutectic temperature is reached the remaining liquid forms the layered tin/lead eutectic structure, which is shiny and the contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal.

Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue. Tin, like [[indium]], is soft enough to be cut without much force.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Theodore |url=http://www.theodoregray.com/Periodictable/Ref/050/index.html |work=The Elements |title=Tin images |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal |date=2007}}</ref> When a bar of tin is bent, the so-called \u201c[[tin cry]]\u201d can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming; this trait is shared by indium, [[cadmium]], and frozen [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals. However, in most tin [[alloy]]s (such as [[pewter]]), the metal solidifies with a dull gray color. Tin is a [[post-transition metal]] in [[group 14]] of the [[periodic table of elements]]. It is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], which contains [[tin dioxide|stannic oxide]], SnO<sub>2</sub>. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, [[germanium]] and [[lead]], and has two main [[oxidation state]]s, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10&nbsp;stable isotopes, the largest number of stable [[isotope]]s in the periodic table, thanks to its [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of protons. It has two main [[allotrope]]s: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin, a silvery-white, [[malleable]] metal, but at low temperatures, it transforms into the less dense grey \u03b1-tin, which has the [[diamond cubic]] structure. Metallic tin does not easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air.\n\nThe first tin alloy used on a large scale was [[bronze]], made of {{frac|1|8}}&nbsp;tin and {{frac|7|8}}&nbsp;[[copper]], from as early as 3000&nbsp;BC. After 600&nbsp;BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\u201390% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of [[copper]], [[antimony]], and lead, was used for [[tableware|flatware]] from the [[Bronze Age]] until the 20th&nbsp;century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft [[solder]]s, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of [[indium tin oxide]] in [[optoelectronic]] applications. Another large application for tin is [[corrosion]]-resistant [[tin plating]] of [[steel]]. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as [[tin can]]s. However, some [[Organotin chemistry|organotin compounds]] can be almost as toxic as [[cyanide]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical===\n[[File:Tin-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Drop (liquid)|Droplet]] of solidified molten tin]]\nTin is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and highly [[crystal]]line silvery-white [[metal]].

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the \"First International Tin Agreement\" in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the [[International Tin Council]] (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.<ref name=price/>\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981\u201382 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major \"tin crisis\" followed \u2014 tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s.<ref name=price>Carlin, James F., Jr. (1998).

Since the European Union [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE Directive) and [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] came into effect on 1 July 2006, the lead content in such alloys has decreased. Replacing lead has many problems, including a higher melting point, and the formation of [[Whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]] causing electrical problems. [[Tin pest]] can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are rapidly being found, although problems of joint integrity remain.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.113-a682| author = Black, Harvey|title = Getting the Lead Out of Electronics| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|volume = 113|issue = 10|date = 2005| pmid = 16203230| pages = A682\u20135| pmc = 1281311}}</ref>\n\n===Tin plating===\nTin bonds readily to [[iron]] and is used for coating [[lead]], zinc and steel to prevent corrosion.

The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead phase solidifies first, then when the eutectic temperature is reached the remaining liquid forms the layered tin/lead eutectic structure, which is shiny and the contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal.

The population of Kuusankoski was 20,392 (2003) and the total area was 129.5&nbsp;km\u00b2 of which 114&nbsp;km\u00b2 was land and 14.56&nbsp;km\u00b2 water. It is located some {{convert|130|km|-1}} northeast of the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]]. Kuusankoski is primarily known for paper manufacturing and three large factory complexes. It is sometimes nicknamed the \"Paper capital of Finland\".\n\n== History ==\n\nKuusankoski (as a [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]], not the settlement), was founded in 1921 from the parts of neighbouring [[Iitti]] and [[Valkeala]]. It gained the status of ''kauppala'' (literally ''\"a place of commerce\"'') in 1957 and became a town in 1973.\n\nThe history of Kuusankoski during the last one and a half centuries has been closely linked to the establishment of the paper factories and their development. The establishment of the factories dates back to the 1870s and 1890s, when the rapids of the river [[Kymijoki]] were made to deliver electricity to a waking industry. Since then, and until the modern age of [[automation]], the factories have offered jobs to many generations of Kuusankoski citizens, making the area somewhat more prosperous than the neighbouring regions. Today, the influence of the factories on everyday life has somewhat lessened, but their historical importance remains well known.\n\nThe cityscape of Kuusankoski consists mostly of element-based blocks of flats built during the 1960s. However, there are some exceptions, such as a school and a church built at the beginning of the last century.

The population of Kuusankoski was 20,392 (2003) and the total area was 129.5&nbsp;km\u00b2 of which 114&nbsp;km\u00b2 was land and 14.56&nbsp;km\u00b2 water. It is located some {{convert|130|km|-1}} northeast of the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]]. Kuusankoski is primarily known for paper manufacturing and three large factory complexes. It is sometimes nicknamed the \"Paper capital of Finland\".\n\n== History ==\n\nKuusankoski (as a [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]], not the settlement), was founded in 1921 from the parts of neighbouring [[Iitti]] and [[Valkeala]]. It gained the status of ''kauppala'' (literally ''\"a place of commerce\"'') in 1957 and became a town in 1973.\n\nThe history of Kuusankoski during the last one and a half centuries has been closely linked to the establishment of the paper factories and their development. The establishment of the factories dates back to the 1870s and 1890s, when the rapids of the river [[Kymijoki]] were made to deliver electricity to a waking industry. Since then, and until the modern age of [[automation]], the factories have offered jobs to many generations of Kuusankoski citizens, making the area somewhat more prosperous than the neighbouring regions. Today, the influence of the factories on everyday life has somewhat lessened, but their historical importance remains well known.\n\nThe cityscape of Kuusankoski consists mostly of element-based blocks of flats built during the 1960s. However, there are some exceptions, such as a school and a church built at the beginning of the last century. Another kind of [[architecture]] is represented by the culture building [[Kuusankoskitalo]], a typical creation of modern [[Finnish architecture]], and a library built in a [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] style. The cityscape is also characterised by the river Kymijoki which curves through the town.\n\nFootballer [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]] is from Kuusankoski. Ex-Nightwish singer [[Tarja Turunen]] also lives in the town.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs of 2009, the six municipalities \u2013 [[Kouvola]], Kuusankoski, [[Elim\u00e4ki]], [[Anjalankoski]], [[Valkeala]] and [[Jaala]] \u2013 were consolidated, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola with a population of over 80,000, being the 10th largest city in Finland.\n\n==[[Hydropower]]==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Plants<ref>[http://www.fingrid.fi/en/customers/Customer%20attachments/Quarantees%20of%20origin/Production%20plants%202014.pdf Production plants registered in the Finnish GoO system], 2014.</ref>\n!Name\n!Power (MW)\n!Company\n|-\n| Kuusankoski hydropower plant \n|30\n|[[UPM-Kymmene Oyj]]\n|-\n| Voikkaa hydropower plant \n|30\n|[[UPM-Kymmene Oyj]]\n|-\n| Keltti hydropower plant \n|17\n|[[UPM-Kymmene Oyj]]\n|}\n\n==People born in Kuusankoski==\n*[[Kalevi Laitinen (speed skater)|Kalevi Laitinen]] (1919 \u2013 1995)\n*[[Eeva-Kaarina Volanen]] (1921 \u2013 1999)\n*[[Veikko Kansikas]] (1923 \u2013 1991)\n*[[Erkki Kataja]] (1924 \u2013 1969)\n*[[Aulis Kallakorpi]] (1929 \u2013 2005)\n*[[Kaj Chydenius]] (1939 \u2013 )\n*[[Maija-Liisa Peuhu]] (1942 \u2013 )\n*[[Esa Jokinen]] (1958 \u2013 )\n*[[Janne Lindberg]] (1966 \u2013 )\n*[[Jukka Heinikainen]] (1972 \u2013 )\n*[[Jani Uotinen]] (1978 \u2013 )\n*[[Jukka Rajala]] (1982 \u2013 )\n*[[Sami Hyypia]] (1973 - )\n*[[Aste (rapper)|Jani Sutelainen]] (1985 - )\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Kuusankoski}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040520214926/http://www.kuusankoski.fi/ Kuusankoski \u2013 Suomen paperikaupunki (in Finnish)]\n\n{{kymenlaakso}}\n\n{{Coord|60|54|30|N|26|37|25|E|region:FI_type:city(20392)_scale:100000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1921]]\n[[Category:Populated places disestablished in 2009]]\n[[Category:2009 disestablishments in Finland]]\n[[Category:Former municipalities of Finland]]\n[[Category:Kouvola]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuusankoski"}

Hatzalah branches are currently being organized in other states as well.\n\nIn Israel, there are two Hatzalah organizations operating on the national level, [[United Hatzalah|Ichud Hatzalah]] ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d4}}), Hebrew for, \"[[United Hatzalah]]\", and Tzevet Hatzalah (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d4). While [[United Hatzalah]] is inarguably the larger of the two organizations, their volunteers are limited to direct response on scene care, versus Tzevet Hatzalah volunteers which are additionally licensed and authorized to provide emergency transport utilizing [[Magen David Adom]] ambulances.\n\n== Operations ==\n[[File:Hatzolah Ambulances (48236940816).jpg|thumb|right|Two Hatzolah ambulances on stand-by in the [[Upper East Side]] ]]\nHatzalah uses a [[fly-car]] system, where members are assigned [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] to respond to the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via [[Walkie-talkie|handheld radios]], and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an [[ambulance]] from a base location.<ref name=\"NYC Ops\"/>\n\nEach directly dispatched Hatzolah volunteer has a full medical technician \"jump kit\" in their car, with oxygen, trauma, and appropriate pharmaceutical supplies. Paramedic (EMT-P) members carry more extensive equipment and supplies, including [[EKG]], [[Intravenous therapy|IV]], injection, intubation, and other pharmaceuticals.  Each volunteer is called a ''unit'' (as in, a crew of one) and is assigned a unit number that starts with a neighborhood code, followed by a [[serial number]] for that neighborhood (e.g., \"Q-120\" means \"Queens unit number 120\"<ref name=\"Madrich\">{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |author2=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger |publisher=Feldheim}}</ref>). Ambulances also have unit numbers in the same format, with the first few numbers for each neighborhood reserved for the ambulance numbers.<ref name=\"NYC Ops\"/> Some neighborhoods have begun to assign 3-digit unit numbers to their ambulances, using numbers out of the range assigned to human member units (e.g., 900-numbers).\n\nIn some areas there may be periods where coverage is not strong enough, for example on a summer weekend. When this happens, coordinators may assign an on-call rotation. The rotation may still respond from their houses, or they may stay at the garage through their shift. In such periods, Hatzalah functions closer to a typical EMS crew setup, though the dispatchers may still seek non-on-call members to respond, and there will still often be a non-ambulance responder as first dispatched, even if that responder starts from the base.<ref name=\"Madrich\"/>\n\nIn [[Israel]], [[United Hatzalah]] relies upon mobile phone technologies which include an SOS [[Mobile app|app]] and a special emergency phone number, 1221, with messages to news organizations distributed by [[WhatsApp]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wootliff|first1=Raoul|title=After blogs and Facebook, military censor sets sights on WhatsApp|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-blogs-and-facebook-military-censor-sets-sights-on-whatsapp/|accessdate=17 February 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=17 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Response times ===\nHatzalah's model provides for speedy [[Certified first responder|first responder]] response times. Each Hatzalah neighborhood's response time varies.  For example, in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] daytime response  in life threatening emergency are between 1\u20132 minutes and nighttime response times are 5\u20136 minutes.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/>  In the Beverly-La Brea neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]] response times average at sixty to ninety seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=7785 | title= Jewish Journal | year=2001}}</ref>\nIn Israel, the response time is under 3 minutes<ref>{{cite web |last1=United Hatzalah |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://israelrescue.org/blog/faq/ |website=israelrescue.org |publisher=United Hatzalah |accessdate=30 June 2019}}</ref>.\n\n=== Organization ===\nHatzalah is not a single organization. Each chapter operates autonomously, or in some cases, with varying levels of affiliation with neighboring Hatzalah chapters.<ref name=Affiliates/><ref name=\"NYC Branches\"/>\n\nIn New York City's Hatzalah, there is a very simple operational hierarchy. Usually, there are two or three members who are \"coordinators,\"<ref name=\"NYC Struct\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/central.php|title=Regional Locations - Central Coordination}}</ref> managing all operations aspects of the chapter.\n\nAs Orthodox Jews, many volunteers see each other daily during [[Jewish services|prayers]], and especially on [[Shabbat]]. This allows them to remain organized despite the lack of an extensive formal hierarchy.\n\nThe coordinators are responsible for recruitment, interaction with municipal agency operations (police, fire, and EMS), first-line discipline, and day-to-day operations. The coordinators often are responsible, directly or via delegation, for arranging maintenance crews, who are often called service members or service units, and for purchasing supplies, ambulances, and other equipment. There is also an administrative function, often separate from the coordinator function. The chief administrator is often called a director or [[executive director]], and this is sometimes a paid position. All other positions in Hatzalah, including coordinators, are held by unpaid volunteers.\n\nMost of the New York State branches have some centralized administration and dispatch functions, known as \"Central Hatzalah,\" or simply, \"Central.\" The neighborhood organizations under Central are nevertheless independent. Most Hatzalah organizations pattern themselves after the Williamsburg and Central models (see operational descriptions below).\n\nFormally, the New York City-area \"Central Hatzalah\" is called Chevra Hatzalah of New York. It combines dispatch and some other functions for over a dozen neighborhood organizations, including<ref name=\"NYC Branches\">{{cite web |title=Regional Branches|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/localBranches.php}}</ref> [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]],<ref name=Willie/> [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Canarsie]], Crown Heights, [[Lower East Side]], [[Upper West Side]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Queens]], Rockaways & Nassau County, [[Seagate, Brooklyn|Seagate]], [[Catskills]], [[Staten Island]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and others. As each of these areas is otherwise independent, each has its own fundraising, management, garages, ambulances, and assigned members. [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County, NY]] and [[Kiryas Joel]] ([[Palm Tree, New York|Town of Palm Tree]]) branches have a centralized dispatch system as well, but their [[central organization]] is separate from the other New York State centralized functions, and they have a looser relationship with their New York State brethren, though there is a great deal of cooperation among them.

While [[United Hatzalah]] is inarguably the larger of the two organizations, their volunteers are limited to direct response on scene care, versus Tzevet Hatzalah volunteers which are additionally licensed and authorized to provide emergency transport utilizing [[Magen David Adom]] ambulances.\n\n== Operations ==\n[[File:Hatzolah Ambulances (48236940816).jpg|thumb|right|Two Hatzolah ambulances on stand-by in the [[Upper East Side]] ]]\nHatzalah uses a [[fly-car]] system, where members are assigned [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] to respond to the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via [[Walkie-talkie|handheld radios]], and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an [[ambulance]] from a base location.<ref name=\"NYC Ops\"/>\n\nEach directly dispatched Hatzolah volunteer has a full medical technician \"jump kit\" in their car, with oxygen, trauma, and appropriate pharmaceutical supplies. Paramedic (EMT-P) members carry more extensive equipment and supplies, including [[EKG]], [[Intravenous therapy|IV]], injection, intubation, and other pharmaceuticals.  Each volunteer is called a ''unit'' (as in, a crew of one) and is assigned a unit number that starts with a neighborhood code, followed by a [[serial number]] for that neighborhood (e.g., \"Q-120\" means \"Queens unit number 120\"<ref name=\"Madrich\">{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |author2=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger |publisher=Feldheim}}</ref>). Ambulances also have unit numbers in the same format, with the first few numbers for each neighborhood reserved for the ambulance numbers.<ref name=\"NYC Ops\"/> Some neighborhoods have begun to assign 3-digit unit numbers to their ambulances, using numbers out of the range assigned to human member units (e.g., 900-numbers).\n\nIn some areas there may be periods where coverage is not strong enough, for example on a summer weekend. When this happens, coordinators may assign an on-call rotation. The rotation may still respond from their houses, or they may stay at the garage through their shift. In such periods, Hatzalah functions closer to a typical EMS crew setup, though the dispatchers may still seek non-on-call members to respond, and there will still often be a non-ambulance responder as first dispatched, even if that responder starts from the base.<ref name=\"Madrich\"/>\n\nIn [[Israel]], [[United Hatzalah]] relies upon mobile phone technologies which include an SOS [[Mobile app|app]] and a special emergency phone number, 1221, with messages to news organizations distributed by [[WhatsApp]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wootliff|first1=Raoul|title=After blogs and Facebook, military censor sets sights on WhatsApp|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-blogs-and-facebook-military-censor-sets-sights-on-whatsapp/|accessdate=17 February 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=17 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Response times ===\nHatzalah's model provides for speedy [[Certified first responder|first responder]] response times. Each Hatzalah neighborhood's response time varies.  For example, in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] daytime response  in life threatening emergency are between 1\u20132 minutes and nighttime response times are 5\u20136 minutes.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/>  In the Beverly-La Brea neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]] response times average at sixty to ninety seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=7785 | title= Jewish Journal | year=2001}}</ref>\nIn Israel, the response time is under 3 minutes<ref>{{cite web |last1=United Hatzalah |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://israelrescue.org/blog/faq/ |website=israelrescue.org |publisher=United Hatzalah |accessdate=30 June 2019}}</ref>.\n\n=== Organization ===\nHatzalah is not a single organization. Each chapter operates autonomously, or in some cases, with varying levels of affiliation with neighboring Hatzalah chapters.<ref name=Affiliates/><ref name=\"NYC Branches\"/>\n\nIn New York City's Hatzalah, there is a very simple operational hierarchy. Usually, there are two or three members who are \"coordinators,\"<ref name=\"NYC Struct\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/central.php|title=Regional Locations - Central Coordination}}</ref> managing all operations aspects of the chapter.\n\nAs Orthodox Jews, many volunteers see each other daily during [[Jewish services|prayers]], and especially on [[Shabbat]]. This allows them to remain organized despite the lack of an extensive formal hierarchy.\n\nThe coordinators are responsible for recruitment, interaction with municipal agency operations (police, fire, and EMS), first-line discipline, and day-to-day operations. The coordinators often are responsible, directly or via delegation, for arranging maintenance crews, who are often called service members or service units, and for purchasing supplies, ambulances, and other equipment. There is also an administrative function, often separate from the coordinator function. The chief administrator is often called a director or [[executive director]], and this is sometimes a paid position. All other positions in Hatzalah, including coordinators, are held by unpaid volunteers.\n\nMost of the New York State branches have some centralized administration and dispatch functions, known as \"Central Hatzalah,\" or simply, \"Central.\" The neighborhood organizations under Central are nevertheless independent. Most Hatzalah organizations pattern themselves after the Williamsburg and Central models (see operational descriptions below).\n\nFormally, the New York City-area \"Central Hatzalah\" is called Chevra Hatzalah of New York. It combines dispatch and some other functions for over a dozen neighborhood organizations, including<ref name=\"NYC Branches\">{{cite web |title=Regional Branches|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/localBranches.php}}</ref> [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]],<ref name=Willie/> [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Canarsie]], Crown Heights, [[Lower East Side]], [[Upper West Side]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Queens]], Rockaways & Nassau County, [[Seagate, Brooklyn|Seagate]], [[Catskills]], [[Staten Island]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and others. As each of these areas is otherwise independent, each has its own fundraising, management, garages, ambulances, and assigned members. [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County, NY]] and [[Kiryas Joel]] ([[Palm Tree, New York|Town of Palm Tree]]) branches have a centralized dispatch system as well, but their [[central organization]] is separate from the other New York State centralized functions, and they have a looser relationship with their New York State brethren, though there is a great deal of cooperation among them.  Together, the combined New York State branches have grown to become the largest all-volunteer ambulance system in the United States.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2005a%2Fpr138-05.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1 | title=Mayor Michael R.

It was the [[British Army]]'s standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=90}}{{sfn|Hogg|1978|p=215}} The WWI versions are often referred to as the \"SMLE\", which is short for the common \"Short, Magazine, Lee\u2013Enfield\" variant.\n\nA redesign of the [[Lee\u2013Metford]] (adopted by the British Army in 1888), the Lee\u2013Enfield superseded the earlier [[Martini\u2013Henry]], [[Martini\u2013Enfield]], and Lee\u2013Metford rifles. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the [[.303 British]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round [[stripper clip|chargers]]. The Lee\u2013Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South Africa, among others).{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=587}} Although officially replaced in the UK with the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1A1 SLR]] in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the [[7.62x51mm NATO|7.62 mm]] [[L42A1]] sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations,{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=264}} notably with the Bangladesh Police, which makes it the second longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service, after the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] (Mosin-Nagant [[Receiver (firearms)|receivers]] are used in the Finnish [[7.62 Tkiv 85]]).{{sfn|Wilson|2007}} The [[Canadian Rangers]] unit still use Enfield rifles, with plans to replace the weapons sometime in 2017\u20132018 with the new Sako-designed [[Colt Canada C19]].<ref name=\"Ottawa Citizen 20111017\">{{cite news |last=Pugliese |first=David |title=Military draws blanks in bids for rifles Firms don't want to give up secrets |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Military_draws_blanks_bids_rifles/5559652/story.html |accessdate=26 January 2012 |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=17 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64yrkPBMO?url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Military%20draws%20blanks%20bids%20rifles/5559652/story.html |archivedate=26 January 2012 |location=Ottawa |url-status=dead}}</ref> Total production of all Lee\u2013Enfields is estimated at over 17 million rifles.{{sfn|Skennerton|1993|p=153, 230}}\n\nThe Lee\u2013Enfield takes its name from the designer of the rifle's bolt system\u2014[[James Paris Lee]]\u2014and the factory in which it was designed\u2014the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]].\n\n==Design and history==\nThe Lee\u2013Enfield rifle was derived from the earlier Lee\u2013Metford, a mechanically similar [[Black powder|black-powder]] rifle, which combined [[James Paris Lee]]'s rear-locking bolt system that had a barrel featuring rifling designed by [[William Ellis Metford]]. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the \"cock on opening\" (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the [[Gewehr 98#M98 controlled-feed bolt-action system|Mauser Gewehr 98]] design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favourable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some [[British Army]] circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee\u2013Metford and Lee\u2013Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=60}} To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most riflemen without loss of sight picture.\n\nThese design features facilitate rapid cycling and fire compared to other bolt-action designs like the Mauser.{{sfn|Hogg|1978|p=215}} The Lee bolt-action and 10-round [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] capacity enabled a well-trained rifleman to perform the \"[[mad minute]]\" firing 20 to 30 aimed rounds in 60 seconds, making the Lee\u2013Enfield the fastest military bolt-action rifle of the day.

These are called Mk IV Cond., with various asterisks denoting subtypes.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}\n\nDuring the First World War, the SMLE Mk III was found to be too complicated to manufacture (an SMLE Mk III rifle cost the British Government [[\u00a3sd|\u00a33/15/\u2013]]) and demand outstripped supply; in late 1915 the '''Mk III*''' was introduced, which incorporated several changes, the most prominent of which were the deletion of the [[Magazine (firearms)#Magazine cut-off|magazine cut-off]] mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve and the long-range volley sights.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|pp=132, 161}}{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}{{sfn|Skennerton|2001|p=7}} The windage adjustment of the rear sight was also dispensed with, and the cocking piece was changed from a round knob to a serrated slab.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=161}} Rifles with some or all of these features present are found, as the changes were implemented at different times in different factories and as stocks of parts were depleted.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=7}} The magazine cut-off was reinstated after the First World War ended and not entirely dispensed with in manufacturing until 1933 and some rifles with cut-offs remained into the 1960s.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=161}}\n\nThe inability of the principal manufacturers ([[Royal Small Arms Factory|RSAF Enfield]], [[Birmingham Small Arms|The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited]] and [[London Small Arms Co.

Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the [[Korean War]], until it was replaced by the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle#Australia|L1A1 SLR]] in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=338}} The [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory]] finally ceased production of the SMLE Mk III* in 1953.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}\n\nThe [[Rifle Factory Ishapore]] at Ishapore in India produced the Mk III* in .303 British and then upgraded the manufactured strength by heat treatment of the receiver and bolt to fire [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] ammunition, the model 2A, which retained the 2,000 yard rear sight as the metric conversion of distance was very close to the flatter trajectory of the new ammunition nature, then changed the rear sight to 800&nbsp;m re-named model 2A1.

The main deficiency of the rounds at the time was that they used heavy, round-nosed bullets that had low muzzle velocities and poor ballistic performance. The [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]] rounds fired from the [[Mauser Model 1895]] rifle had a higher velocity, flatter trajectory and longer range, making them superior on the open country of the South African plains. Work on a long-range replacement cartridge began in 1910 and resulted in the [[.276 Enfield]] in 1912. A new rifle based on the Mauser design was created to fire the round, called the [[Pattern 1913 Enfield]]. Although the .276 Enfield had better ballistics, troop trials in 1913 revealed problems including excessive recoil, muzzle flash, barrel wear and overheating. Attempts were made to find a cooler-burning propellant but further trials were halted in 1914 by the onset of the [[First World War]]. This proved fortunate for the Lee\u2013Enfield, as wartime demand and the improved Mk VII loading of the .303 round caused it to be retained for service.<ref>[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/256brit.htm THE .256 INCH BRITISH: A LOST OPPORTUNITY by Anthony G Williams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606221212/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/256brit.htm |date=6 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Pattern 1914/US M1917==\n{{Main|Pattern 1914 Enfield|M1917 Enfield}}\n\nThe Pattern 1914 Enfield and M1917 Enfield rifles are based on the Enfield-designed P1913, itself a Mauser 98 derivative and not based on the Lee action, and are not part of the Lee\u2013Enfield family of rifles, although they are frequently assumed to be.{{sfn|War Office|1999|p=7\u20138}}\n\n==Inter-war period==\n[[File:Enfield No4 Mk1 Longbranch rear sights.JPG|thumb|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk I Long Branch aperture sights]]\n\nIn 1926, the British Army changed their nomenclature; the SMLE became known as the '''Rifle No. 1 Mk III''' or '''III*''', with the original MLE and LEC becoming obsolete along with the earlier SMLE models.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=8}} Many Mk III and III* rifles were converted to [[.22 rimfire]] calibre training rifles, and designated '''Rifle No. 2''', of varying marks. (The Pattern 1914 became the '''Rifle No. 3'''.){{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=8}}\n\nThe SMLE design was a relatively expensive long arm to manufacture, because of the many [[forging]] and [[machining]] operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments resulting in design changes were carried out to help with these problems, reducing the number of complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The '''SMLE Mk V''' (later '''Rifle No. 1 Mk V'''), adopted a new [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]]-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}} The increased gap resulted in an improved sighting radius, improving sighting accuracy and the aperture improved speed of sighting over various distances. In the stowed position, a fixed distance aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} protruded saving further precious seconds when laying the sight to a target. An alternative developed during this period was to be used on the No. 4 variant, a \"battle sight\" was developed that allowed for two set distances of 300 yards and 600 yards to be quickly deployed and was cheaper to produce than the \"ladder sight\". The magazine cutoff was also reintroduced and an additional band was added near the muzzle for additional strength during bayonet use.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}} The design was found to be even more complicated and expensive to manufacture than the Mk III and was not developed or issued, beyond a trial production of about 20,000 rifles between 1922 and 1924 at [[Royal Small Arms Factory|RSAF Enfield]].{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}}\n\n==Lee\u2013Enfield No. 1 Mk V==\nLong before the No. 4 Mk I, Britain had obviously settled on the rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop in place of the sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached to the rear of the nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922\u20131924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a \"V\".\n\nThe '''No. 1 Mk VI''' also introduced a heavier \"floating barrel\" that was independent of the forearm, allowing the barrel to expand and contract without contacting the forearm and interfering with the 'zero', the correlation between the alignment of the barrel and the sights. The floating barrel increased the accuracy of the rifle by allowing it to vibrate freely and consistently, whereas wooden forends in contact with barrels, if not properly fitted, affected the harmonic vibrations of the barrel. The receiver-mounted rear sights and magazine cutoff were also present and 1,025 units were produced in the 1930 period.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=189, 194}}\n\n==Rifle No. 4==\n[[File:Lee-Enfield No 4 Mk I (1943) - AM.032027.jpg|thumb|300px|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk I]]\n[[File:EnfieldNo4Mk2-303Brit.jpg|thumb|300px|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk 2 with the ladder aperture sight flipped up and 5-round [[stripper clip|charger]]]]\n\nIn the early 1930s, a batch of 2,500 No. 4 Mk. I rifles were made for trials. These were similar to the No. 1 Mk. VI but had a flat left side and did away with the chequering on the furniture. Observed examples are dated 1931 and 1933. Roughly 1,400 of these were converted to No. 4 MK. I (T) sniper rifles in 1941\u20131942 at RSAF Enfield.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the need for new rifles grew and the '''Rifle, No. 4 Mk I''' was officially adopted in 1941.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=5}} The No. 4 action was similar to the No.1 Mk VI but stronger and easier to mass-produce.{{sfn|Smith|1979|p=21}} Unlike the SMLE, that had a nose cap, the No 4 Lee\u2013Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. For easier machining, the charger bridge was no longer rounded.\nThe [[iron sight]] line was redesigned and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for {{convert|200|\u2013|1300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} increments. This sight, like other aperture sights, proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel open rear sight elements sight lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee\u2013Enfields or the Buffington battle sight of the [[1903 Springfield]].\n\nThe No. 4 rifle was heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel. A new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a [[spike bayonet]], which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point and was nicknamed \"pigsticker\" by soldiers.{{sfn|Smith|1979|p=21}} Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed for the No.5 Mk.I rifle (\"Jungle Carbine\".) Post-war versions were made that would fit No. 4 rifles and were designated No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=406}}\n\nDuring the course of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further simplified for mass-production with the creation of the '''No. 4 Mk I*''' in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle's receiver. It was produced only in North America, by Small Arms Limited, at Long Branch in Canada and Stevens-Savage Firearms, in the USA.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=9}} The No.4 rifle was primarily produced for the United Kingdom, Canada and some other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=230}}\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, the British produced the '''No. 4 Mk 2''' ([[Arabic numeral]]s replaced [[Roman numeral]]s in official names in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the trigger guard, beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood in the rear of the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass \"gunmetal\" buttplates (during the war the British, Americans and Canadians replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with a zinc alloy ([[Zamak]]) type to reduce costs and to speed up rifle production). Near the end of the war and after, Canada made blued steel buttplates. {{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=7}} With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=6}} The No. 4 Mk 1 rifles were re-named '''No. 4 Mk I/2''', whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were renamed '''No. 4 Mk I/3'''.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=9}}\n\n==Rifle No. 5 Mk I\u2014the \"Jungle Carbine\"==\n[[File:Lee-Enfield no 5-IMG 6559-white.jpg|thumb|Rifle No 5 on display at the [[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum]].]]\n{{Main|Jungle Carbine}}\nLater in the war, the need for a shorter, lighter rifle forced the development of the '''Rifle, No. 5 Mk I''' (the \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\").{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} With a cut-down stock, a prominent [[flash hider]], and a \"lightening-cut\" receiver machined to remove all unnecessary metal, reduced barrel length of {{convert|18.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} the No. 5 was shorter and {{convert|2|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} lighter. Despite a [[Natural rubber|rubber]] butt-pad, the .303 round produced excessive recoil due to the shorter barrel. It was unsuitable for general issue and production ceased in 1947, due to an \"inherent fault in the design\", often claimed to be a \"[[Jungle Carbine#Wandering Zero|wandering zero]]\" and accuracy problems.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994a|p=8}}\n\nThe No. 5 [[iron sight]] line was similar to the No. 4 Mark I and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for {{convert|200|-|800|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} increments. The No. 5 Mk I was popular with soldiers owing to its light weight, portability and shorter length than a standard Lee\u2013Enfield rifle.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994a|p=7}} The No. 5 was first issued to the British 1st Airborne Division and used during their liberation of Denmark [[Operation Doomsday|and Norway]] in 1945. BSA-Shirley, Birmingham produced 81,329 rifles and ROF Fazakerley, Liverpool 169,807 rifles. It was equipped with a No. 5 Mk. I blade bayonet which had a large muzzle ring to fit over the flash hider. The No. 7 Mk. I/L bayonet, which has a rotating handle and a large ring on the cross-guard was not for the No. 5 Mk. I rifle as many collectors believe.\n\nAn Australian experimental version of the No. 5 Mk I, designated '''Rifle, No. 6, Mk I'''{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=349}} was also developed, using an SMLE MK III* as a starting point (as opposed to the No. 4 Mk I used to develop the No. 5 Mk I). The Australian military were not permitted to manufacture the No. 4 Mk I, because the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was producing the SMLE Mk III. The No. 6 Mk I never entered full production and examples are rare and valuable to collectors.{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} A \"Shortened and Lightened\" version of the SMLE Mk III* rifle was also tested by the Australian military and a very small number were manufactured at SAF Lithgow during the course of the Second World War.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=347}}\n\nThe term \"Jungle Carbine\" was popularised in the 1950s by the Santa Fe Arms Corporation, a U.S. importer who refurbished many surplus rifles, converting many of the No. 4 marks, in the hope of increasing sales of a rifle that had little U.S. market penetration. It was never an official military designation but British and Commonwealth troops serving in the Burmese and Pacific theatres during World War II had been known to unofficially refer to the No. 5 Mk I as a \"Jungle Carbine\".{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} The No. 4 and No. 5 rifles served in Korea (as did the No.1 Mk III* SMLE and sniper 'T' variants, mostly with Australian troops).{{sfn|Wilson|2007}}\n\n==Lee\u2013Enfield conversions and training models==\n\n===Sniper rifles===\n[[File:Sergeant H.A.

The wooden cheek-piece was attached with two screws. The rear \"battle sight\" was ground off to make room to attach the No. 32 telescope sight to the left side of the receiver.

The Canadian scopes made by Research Enterprises Limited and were prefixed with a letter C and went through C no. 32 Mk. I, Mk. I A (a transitional model), Mk. II and Mk. 3.  Many Mk. 3s and Mk. 2/1s (Mk. 2s Modified to Mk. 3 standard) were later modified for use with the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO [[L42A1]] Sniper Rifle. They were then known by the designation Telescope Straight, Sighting L1A1.\n\nInitial production was 1,403 conversions of 1931\u20131933 troop trials No. 4 Mk. I rifles at RSAF Enfield and a few others including Stevens-Savage No. 4s. These were converted in late 1941 and into the later part of 1942. Then, the work was assigned to [[Holland & Holland]], the famous British sporting gun manufacturers, which converted about 23,000 No. 4 Mk. I (T) and No. 4 Mk. I* (T) sniper rifles. The Holland & Holland conversions usually have the contractor code \"S51\" on the underside of the buttstock. BSA Shirley undertook 100 conversions to .22\". James Purdey and Sons fitted special buttstocks later in the war. About 3,000 rifles, mostly Stevens-Savage, appear to have been partially converted by Holland & Holland but never received brackets, scopes of the final \"T\" mark. Canada converted about 1,588 rifles at Small Arms Limited (to the end of 1945) and, in 1946, at Canadian Arsenals Limited. Both were located at Long Branch, Ontario. Most of the Canadian made No.4 Mk.I* (T) sniper equipments went into British service. The No.4 (T) rifles were extensively employed in various conflicts until the late 1960s.\n\nThe British military switched over to the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] round in the 1950s; starting in 1970, over 1,000 of the No. 4 Mk I (T) and No. 4 Mk.

These conversions were prompted by firearms legislation that made possession of a rifle chambered in a military cartridge both difficult and expensive. Smoothbored shotguns could be legally held with far less trouble.\n\nRFI, in India, converted a large number of MkIII rifles to single shot muskets, chambered for the .410 Indian Musket cartridge. These conversions were for issue to police and prison guards, to provide a firearm with a much-reduced power and range in comparison to the .303 cartridge. A further likely consideration was the difficulty of obtaining replacement ammunition in the event of the rifle's theft or the carrier's desertion.\n\nWhile British and Australian conversions were to the standard commercially available .410 shotgun cartridge (though of varying chamber lengths) the Indian conversions have been the source of considerable confusion. The Indian conversions were originally chambered for the .410 Indian Musket cartridge, which is based on the .303 British cartridge, and will not chamber the common .410 shotgun cartridge. Many of these muskets were rechambered, after being sold as surplus, and can now be used with commercially available ammunition. Unmodified muskets require handloading of ammunition, as the .410 Indian Musket cartridge was not commercially distributed and does not appear to have been manufactured since the 1950s.\n\nNumerous attempts have been made to convert the various single-shot .410 shotgun models to a bolt-action repeating model by removing the wooden magazine plug and replacing it with a standard 10-round SMLE magazine. None of these is known to have been successful,{{sfn|Griffiths|1998}} though some owners have adapted 3-round magazines for [[Savage Arms|Savage]] and [[Stevens Arms|Stevens]] shotguns to function in a converted SMLE shotgun, or even placing such a magazine inside a gutted SMLE magazine.\n\n===Civilian conversions and variants===\nFrom the late 1940s, legislation in New South Wales, Australia, heavily restricted .303 British calibre (and other \"military calibre\") rifles,{{sfn|Enright|1998}} so large numbers of SMLEs were converted to \"wildcat\" calibres such as [[.303/25]], [[.303/22]], .303/270 and the popular [[7.7\u00d754mm]] round.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=351}} 303/25 calibre sporterised SMLEs are very common in Australia today, although ammunition for them has been very scarce since the 1980s.{{sfn|Enright|1998}} The restrictions placed on \"military calibre\" rifles in New South Wales were lifted in 1975, and many people who had converted their Lee\u2013Enfields to the \"wildcat\" rounds converted their rifles back to .303 British.{{sfn|Enright|1998}} Post-Second World War, SAF Lithgow converted a number of SMLE rifles to commercial sporting rifles- notably the .22 Hornet model- under the \"Slazenger\" brand.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=549}}\n\nIn the early 1950s Essential Agencies Ltd. (E.A.L.), of Toronto, Ontario, produced a run of several thousand survival rifles based on the No. 4 action, but lightened and shortened, chambered in .303 British. Serial numbers below 6000 were for civilian sale, serial numbers 6000 and higher were built under contract to the Canadian government. The Royal Canadian Air Force also used these as a survival rifle in the remote parts of Canada.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===L59A1 Drill Rifle===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nThe L59A1 was a conversion of the No4 Rifle (all Marks) to a [[Drill Purpose Rifle]] that was incapable of being restored to a firing configuration. It was introduced in service in the 1970s. A conversion specification of No.1 rifles to L59A2 Drill Purpose was also prepared but was abandoned due to the greater difficulty of machining involved and the negligible numbers still in the hands of cadet units.\n\nThe L59A1 arose from British government concerns over the vulnerability of Army Cadet Force and school [[Combined Cadet Force]]s' (CCF) stocks of small arms to theft by terrorists, in particular the [[Irish Republican Army]] following raids on CCF armouries in the 1950s and 1960s. Previous conversions to Drill Purpose (DP) of otherwise serviceable rifles were not considered to be sufficiently incapable of restoration to fireable state and were a potential source of reconversion spares.\n\nL59A1 Drill Rifles were rendered incapable of being fired, and of being restored to a fireable form, by extensive modifications that included the welding of the barrel to the receiver, modifications to the receiver that removed the supporting structures for the bolt's locking lugs and blocking the installation of an unaltered bolt, the removal of the striker's tip, the blocking of the striker's hole in the bolt head and the removal of most of the bolt body's locking lugs. Most bolts were copper plated for identification. A plug was welded in place forward of the chamber, and a window was cut in the side of the barrel. The stock and fore end was marked with broad white painted bands and the letters \"DP\" for easy identification.\n\n==Special service Lee\u2013Enfields: Commando and automatic models==\n===Charlton Automatic Rifles===\n{{Main|Charlton Automatic Rifle}}\n\n[[File:Charlton Automatic Rifle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Charlton Automatic Rifle.]]\n\nSmall numbers of Lee\u2013Enfield rifles were built as, or converted to, experimental automatic loading systems, such as the British [[Howell Automatic Rifle|Howell]] and South African [[Rieder Automatic Rifle|Rieder]] and the best-known of which was the '''Charlton Automatic Rifle''', designed by a New Zealander, Philip Charlton in 1941 to act as a substitute for the [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] and [[Lewis gun]] light machine guns which were in chronically short supply at the time.{{sfn|Skennerton|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=203}} During the Second World War, the majority of New Zealand's land forces were deployed in North Africa.

The main difference between the two conversions was in the cartridge ejection arrangement; the Enfield magazine carried a hardened steel projection that struck the rim of the extracted case to eject it, the Sterling system employed a spring-loaded plunger inserted into the receiver wall.\n\nThe results of the trials that were conducted on the L8 series rifles were mixed and the British Government and the Ministry of Defence decided not to convert their existing stocks of Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 rifles to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO. Despite this, the British learned from the results of the L8 test program and used them in successfully converting their stocks of No. 4 (T) sniper rifles to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, which led to the creation of the L42A1 series sniper rifles.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|pp=260\u2013264}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, RSAF Enfield entered the commercial market by producing No.4-based 7.62\u00d751mm rifles for sale. The products were marketed under alliterative names e.g. Enfield Envoy, a rifle intended for civilian competition target shooting and Enfield Enforcer, a rifle fitted with a Pecar telescopic sight to suit the requirements of police firearms teams.\n\n===Ishapore 2A/2A1===\n{{Main|Ishapore 2A1 rifle}}\n\n[[File:RFI Rifle 7.62mm 2A1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ishapore 2A1.]]\n\nAt some point just after the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962, the Rifle Factory Ishapore in India began producing a new type of rifle known as the '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 2A''', which was based on the SMLE Mk III*{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=515}} and was slightly redesigned to use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round. Externally the new rifle is very similar to the classic Mk III*, with the exception of the buttplate (the buttplate from the 1A SLR is fitted) and magazine, which is more \"square\" than the SMLE magazine, and usually carries twelve rounds instead of ten,{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=370}} although a number of 2A1s have been noted with 10-round magazines.\n\nIshapore 2A and Ishapore 2A1 receivers are made with improved (EN) steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62\u00d751mm round){{sfn|Skennerton|2004b|p=5}} and the extractor is redesigned to suit the rimless cartridge. From 1965 to 1975 (when production is believed to have been discontinued), the sight ranging graduations were changed from 2000 to 800, and the rifle re-designated '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 2A1'''.{{sfn|Skennerton|2004b|p=14}} The original {{convert|2000|yard|m|lk=on}} rear sight arm was found to be suitable for the ballistics of the 7.62\u00d751mm, which is around 10% more powerful and equates to a flatter trajectory than that of the .303 British MkVII ammunition, so it was a simple matter to think of the '2000' as representing metres rather than yards. It was then decided that the limit of the effective range was a more realistic proposition at 800&nbsp;m.\n\nThe Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as \".308 conversions\". The 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles. Rather, they are ''newly manufactured firearms'' and are not technically chambered for commercial .308 Winchester ammunition. However, many 2A/2A1 owners shoot such ammunition in their rifles with no problems, although some factory loaded .308 Winchester cartridges may appear to generate higher pressures than 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, even though the rounds are otherwise interchangeable \u2013 this is due to the different systems of pressure measurement used for NATO and commercial cartridges.\n\n==Production and manufacturers==\nIn total, over 16 million Lee\u2013Enfields had been produced in several factories on different continents when production in Britain shut down in 1956, at the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] [[ROF Fazakerley]] in Liverpool after that factory had been plagued with industrial unrest.

However, the Lee\u2013Enfield was mainly replaced in main-line service in the Pakistani Police in the mid-1980s by the [[AK 47]], in response to increasing proliferation of the Kalashnikov in the black market and civilian use. In [[Jordan]], the Lee\u2013Enfield was in use with the Police and Gendarmerie until 1971, and with the Armed Forces until 1965. In [[Iraq]] and Egypt, the Lee\u2013Enfield was replaced by the Kalashnikov as the standard issue rifle in the Armed Forces by the late 1950s, and in Police Forces by the late 1970s.\nIn the UK, the single-shot .22 calibre Rifle No. 8 is in regular use with UK Cadet Forces as a light target rifle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rifleman.org.uk/Enfield_Rifle_No.8.html |title=Lee\u2013Enfield Rifle No.8 for the British Forces |publisher=UK N.R.A Historic Arms Resource Centre |accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Enfields continue to be used as drill weapons by the National Ceremonial Guard of the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF).<ref name=SANDF>{{cite web|last=Mashamaite|first=Kgabo|url=http://www.dod.mil.za/news/2012/04/2012randshow.htm |title=The SANDF opens the 2012 Rand Easter Show |publisher=South African Department of Defence |date=2012-04-08|accessdate=2016-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229211820/http://www.dod.mil.za/news/2012/04/2012randshow.htm |archivedate=29 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMany Afghan participants in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were armed with Lee\u2013Enfields.<ref>Modern Warfare, Published by Mark Dartford, Marshall Cavendish (London) 1985</ref> The CIA's [[Operation Cyclone]] provided hundreds of thousands of Enfields to the [[Mujahideen]], funneling them through Pakistan's [[Inter Services Intelligence|ISI]].

It was the [[British Army]]'s standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=90}}{{sfn|Hogg|1978|p=215}} The WWI versions are often referred to as the \"SMLE\", which is short for the common \"Short, Magazine, Lee\u2013Enfield\" variant.\n\nA redesign of the [[Lee\u2013Metford]] (adopted by the British Army in 1888), the Lee\u2013Enfield superseded the earlier [[Martini\u2013Henry]], [[Martini\u2013Enfield]], and Lee\u2013Metford rifles. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the [[.303 British]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round [[stripper clip|chargers]]. The Lee\u2013Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South Africa, among others).{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=587}} Although officially replaced in the UK with the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1A1 SLR]] in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the [[7.62x51mm NATO|7.62 mm]] [[L42A1]] sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations,{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=264}} notably with the Bangladesh Police, which makes it the second longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service, after the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] (Mosin-Nagant [[Receiver (firearms)|receivers]] are used in the Finnish [[7.62 Tkiv 85]]).{{sfn|Wilson|2007}} The [[Canadian Rangers]] unit still use Enfield rifles, with plans to replace the weapons sometime in 2017\u20132018 with the new Sako-designed [[Colt Canada C19]].<ref name=\"Ottawa Citizen 20111017\">{{cite news |last=Pugliese |first=David |title=Military draws blanks in bids for rifles Firms don't want to give up secrets |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Military_draws_blanks_bids_rifles/5559652/story.html |accessdate=26 January 2012 |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=17 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64yrkPBMO?url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Military%20draws%20blanks%20bids%20rifles/5559652/story.html |archivedate=26 January 2012 |location=Ottawa |url-status=dead}}</ref> Total production of all Lee\u2013Enfields is estimated at over 17 million rifles.{{sfn|Skennerton|1993|p=153, 230}}\n\nThe Lee\u2013Enfield takes its name from the designer of the rifle's bolt system\u2014[[James Paris Lee]]\u2014and the factory in which it was designed\u2014the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]].\n\n==Design and history==\nThe Lee\u2013Enfield rifle was derived from the earlier Lee\u2013Metford, a mechanically similar [[Black powder|black-powder]] rifle, which combined [[James Paris Lee]]'s rear-locking bolt system that had a barrel featuring rifling designed by [[William Ellis Metford]]. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the \"cock on opening\" (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the [[Gewehr 98#M98 controlled-feed bolt-action system|Mauser Gewehr 98]] design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favourable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some [[British Army]] circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee\u2013Metford and Lee\u2013Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=60}} To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most riflemen without loss of sight picture.\n\nThese design features facilitate rapid cycling and fire compared to other bolt-action designs like the Mauser.{{sfn|Hogg|1978|p=215}} The Lee bolt-action and 10-round [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] capacity enabled a well-trained rifleman to perform the \"[[mad minute]]\" firing 20 to 30 aimed rounds in 60 seconds, making the Lee\u2013Enfield the fastest military bolt-action rifle of the day.

These are called Mk IV Cond., with various asterisks denoting subtypes.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}\n\nDuring the First World War, the SMLE Mk III was found to be too complicated to manufacture (an SMLE Mk III rifle cost the British Government [[\u00a3sd|\u00a33/15/\u2013]]) and demand outstripped supply; in late 1915 the '''Mk III*''' was introduced, which incorporated several changes, the most prominent of which were the deletion of the [[Magazine (firearms)#Magazine cut-off|magazine cut-off]] mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve and the long-range volley sights.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|pp=132, 161}}{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}{{sfn|Skennerton|2001|p=7}} The windage adjustment of the rear sight was also dispensed with, and the cocking piece was changed from a round knob to a serrated slab.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=161}} Rifles with some or all of these features present are found, as the changes were implemented at different times in different factories and as stocks of parts were depleted.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=7}} The magazine cut-off was reinstated after the First World War ended and not entirely dispensed with in manufacturing until 1933 and some rifles with cut-offs remained into the 1960s.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=161}}\n\nThe inability of the principal manufacturers ([[Royal Small Arms Factory|RSAF Enfield]], [[Birmingham Small Arms|The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited]] and [[London Small Arms Co.

Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the [[Korean War]], until it was replaced by the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle#Australia|L1A1 SLR]] in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=338}} The [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory]] finally ceased production of the SMLE Mk III* in 1953.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=9}}\n\nThe [[Rifle Factory Ishapore]] at Ishapore in India produced the Mk III* in .303 British and then upgraded the manufactured strength by heat treatment of the receiver and bolt to fire [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] ammunition, the model 2A, which retained the 2,000 yard rear sight as the metric conversion of distance was very close to the flatter trajectory of the new ammunition nature, then changed the rear sight to 800&nbsp;m re-named model 2A1.

The main deficiency of the rounds at the time was that they used heavy, round-nosed bullets that had low muzzle velocities and poor ballistic performance. The [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]] rounds fired from the [[Mauser Model 1895]] rifle had a higher velocity, flatter trajectory and longer range, making them superior on the open country of the South African plains. Work on a long-range replacement cartridge began in 1910 and resulted in the [[.276 Enfield]] in 1912. A new rifle based on the Mauser design was created to fire the round, called the [[Pattern 1913 Enfield]]. Although the .276 Enfield had better ballistics, troop trials in 1913 revealed problems including excessive recoil, muzzle flash, barrel wear and overheating. Attempts were made to find a cooler-burning propellant but further trials were halted in 1914 by the onset of the [[First World War]]. This proved fortunate for the Lee\u2013Enfield, as wartime demand and the improved Mk VII loading of the .303 round caused it to be retained for service.<ref>[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/256brit.htm THE .256 INCH BRITISH: A LOST OPPORTUNITY by Anthony G Williams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606221212/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/256brit.htm |date=6 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Pattern 1914/US M1917==\n{{Main|Pattern 1914 Enfield|M1917 Enfield}}\n\nThe Pattern 1914 Enfield and M1917 Enfield rifles are based on the Enfield-designed P1913, itself a Mauser 98 derivative and not based on the Lee action, and are not part of the Lee\u2013Enfield family of rifles, although they are frequently assumed to be.{{sfn|War Office|1999|p=7\u20138}}\n\n==Inter-war period==\n[[File:Enfield No4 Mk1 Longbranch rear sights.JPG|thumb|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk I Long Branch aperture sights]]\n\nIn 1926, the British Army changed their nomenclature; the SMLE became known as the '''Rifle No. 1 Mk III''' or '''III*''', with the original MLE and LEC becoming obsolete along with the earlier SMLE models.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=8}} Many Mk III and III* rifles were converted to [[.22 rimfire]] calibre training rifles, and designated '''Rifle No. 2''', of varying marks. (The Pattern 1914 became the '''Rifle No. 3'''.){{sfn|Skennerton|1994c|p=8}}\n\nThe SMLE design was a relatively expensive long arm to manufacture, because of the many [[forging]] and [[machining]] operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments resulting in design changes were carried out to help with these problems, reducing the number of complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The '''SMLE Mk V''' (later '''Rifle No. 1 Mk V'''), adopted a new [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]]-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}} The increased gap resulted in an improved sighting radius, improving sighting accuracy and the aperture improved speed of sighting over various distances. In the stowed position, a fixed distance aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} protruded saving further precious seconds when laying the sight to a target. An alternative developed during this period was to be used on the No. 4 variant, a \"battle sight\" was developed that allowed for two set distances of 300 yards and 600 yards to be quickly deployed and was cheaper to produce than the \"ladder sight\". The magazine cutoff was also reintroduced and an additional band was added near the muzzle for additional strength during bayonet use.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}} The design was found to be even more complicated and expensive to manufacture than the Mk III and was not developed or issued, beyond a trial production of about 20,000 rifles between 1922 and 1924 at [[Royal Small Arms Factory|RSAF Enfield]].{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=187}}\n\n==Lee\u2013Enfield No. 1 Mk V==\nLong before the No. 4 Mk I, Britain had obviously settled on the rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop in place of the sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached to the rear of the nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922\u20131924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a \"V\".\n\nThe '''No. 1 Mk VI''' also introduced a heavier \"floating barrel\" that was independent of the forearm, allowing the barrel to expand and contract without contacting the forearm and interfering with the 'zero', the correlation between the alignment of the barrel and the sights. The floating barrel increased the accuracy of the rifle by allowing it to vibrate freely and consistently, whereas wooden forends in contact with barrels, if not properly fitted, affected the harmonic vibrations of the barrel. The receiver-mounted rear sights and magazine cutoff were also present and 1,025 units were produced in the 1930 period.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=189, 194}}\n\n==Rifle No. 4==\n[[File:Lee-Enfield No 4 Mk I (1943) - AM.032027.jpg|thumb|300px|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk I]]\n[[File:EnfieldNo4Mk2-303Brit.jpg|thumb|300px|Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 Mk 2 with the ladder aperture sight flipped up and 5-round [[stripper clip|charger]]]]\n\nIn the early 1930s, a batch of 2,500 No. 4 Mk. I rifles were made for trials. These were similar to the No. 1 Mk. VI but had a flat left side and did away with the chequering on the furniture. Observed examples are dated 1931 and 1933. Roughly 1,400 of these were converted to No. 4 MK. I (T) sniper rifles in 1941\u20131942 at RSAF Enfield.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the need for new rifles grew and the '''Rifle, No. 4 Mk I''' was officially adopted in 1941.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=5}} The No. 4 action was similar to the No.1 Mk VI but stronger and easier to mass-produce.{{sfn|Smith|1979|p=21}} Unlike the SMLE, that had a nose cap, the No 4 Lee\u2013Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. For easier machining, the charger bridge was no longer rounded.\nThe [[iron sight]] line was redesigned and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for {{convert|200|\u2013|1300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} increments. This sight, like other aperture sights, proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel open rear sight elements sight lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee\u2013Enfields or the Buffington battle sight of the [[1903 Springfield]].\n\nThe No. 4 rifle was heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel. A new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a [[spike bayonet]], which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point and was nicknamed \"pigsticker\" by soldiers.{{sfn|Smith|1979|p=21}} Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed for the No.5 Mk.I rifle (\"Jungle Carbine\".) Post-war versions were made that would fit No. 4 rifles and were designated No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=406}}\n\nDuring the course of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further simplified for mass-production with the creation of the '''No. 4 Mk I*''' in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle's receiver. It was produced only in North America, by Small Arms Limited, at Long Branch in Canada and Stevens-Savage Firearms, in the USA.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=9}} The No.4 rifle was primarily produced for the United Kingdom, Canada and some other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=230}}\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, the British produced the '''No. 4 Mk 2''' ([[Arabic numeral]]s replaced [[Roman numeral]]s in official names in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the trigger guard, beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood in the rear of the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass \"gunmetal\" buttplates (during the war the British, Americans and Canadians replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with a zinc alloy ([[Zamak]]) type to reduce costs and to speed up rifle production). Near the end of the war and after, Canada made blued steel buttplates. {{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=7}} With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=6}} The No. 4 Mk 1 rifles were re-named '''No. 4 Mk I/2''', whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were renamed '''No. 4 Mk I/3'''.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994b|p=9}}\n\n==Rifle No. 5 Mk I\u2014the \"Jungle Carbine\"==\n[[File:Lee-Enfield no 5-IMG 6559-white.jpg|thumb|Rifle No 5 on display at the [[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum]].]]\n{{Main|Jungle Carbine}}\nLater in the war, the need for a shorter, lighter rifle forced the development of the '''Rifle, No. 5 Mk I''' (the \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\").{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} With a cut-down stock, a prominent [[flash hider]], and a \"lightening-cut\" receiver machined to remove all unnecessary metal, reduced barrel length of {{convert|18.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} the No. 5 was shorter and {{convert|2|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} lighter. Despite a [[Natural rubber|rubber]] butt-pad, the .303 round produced excessive recoil due to the shorter barrel. It was unsuitable for general issue and production ceased in 1947, due to an \"inherent fault in the design\", often claimed to be a \"[[Jungle Carbine#Wandering Zero|wandering zero]]\" and accuracy problems.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994a|p=8}}\n\nThe No. 5 [[iron sight]] line was similar to the No. 4 Mark I and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for {{convert|200|-|800|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} increments. The No. 5 Mk I was popular with soldiers owing to its light weight, portability and shorter length than a standard Lee\u2013Enfield rifle.{{sfn|Skennerton|1994a|p=7}} The No. 5 was first issued to the British 1st Airborne Division and used during their liberation of Denmark [[Operation Doomsday|and Norway]] in 1945. BSA-Shirley, Birmingham produced 81,329 rifles and ROF Fazakerley, Liverpool 169,807 rifles. It was equipped with a No. 5 Mk. I blade bayonet which had a large muzzle ring to fit over the flash hider. The No. 7 Mk. I/L bayonet, which has a rotating handle and a large ring on the cross-guard was not for the No. 5 Mk. I rifle as many collectors believe.\n\nAn Australian experimental version of the No. 5 Mk I, designated '''Rifle, No. 6, Mk I'''{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=349}} was also developed, using an SMLE MK III* as a starting point (as opposed to the No. 4 Mk I used to develop the No. 5 Mk I). The Australian military were not permitted to manufacture the No. 4 Mk I, because the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was producing the SMLE Mk III. The No. 6 Mk I never entered full production and examples are rare and valuable to collectors.{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} A \"Shortened and Lightened\" version of the SMLE Mk III* rifle was also tested by the Australian military and a very small number were manufactured at SAF Lithgow during the course of the Second World War.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=347}}\n\nThe term \"Jungle Carbine\" was popularised in the 1950s by the Santa Fe Arms Corporation, a U.S. importer who refurbished many surplus rifles, converting many of the No. 4 marks, in the hope of increasing sales of a rifle that had little U.S. market penetration. It was never an official military designation but British and Commonwealth troops serving in the Burmese and Pacific theatres during World War II had been known to unofficially refer to the No. 5 Mk I as a \"Jungle Carbine\".{{sfn|Wilson|2006}} The No. 4 and No. 5 rifles served in Korea (as did the No.1 Mk III* SMLE and sniper 'T' variants, mostly with Australian troops).{{sfn|Wilson|2007}}\n\n==Lee\u2013Enfield conversions and training models==\n\n===Sniper rifles===\n[[File:Sergeant H.A.

The wooden cheek-piece was attached with two screws. The rear \"battle sight\" was ground off to make room to attach the No. 32 telescope sight to the left side of the receiver.

The Canadian scopes made by Research Enterprises Limited and were prefixed with a letter C and went through C no. 32 Mk. I, Mk. I A (a transitional model), Mk. II and Mk. 3.  Many Mk. 3s and Mk. 2/1s (Mk. 2s Modified to Mk. 3 standard) were later modified for use with the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO [[L42A1]] Sniper Rifle. They were then known by the designation Telescope Straight, Sighting L1A1.\n\nInitial production was 1,403 conversions of 1931\u20131933 troop trials No. 4 Mk. I rifles at RSAF Enfield and a few others including Stevens-Savage No. 4s. These were converted in late 1941 and into the later part of 1942. Then, the work was assigned to [[Holland & Holland]], the famous British sporting gun manufacturers, which converted about 23,000 No. 4 Mk. I (T) and No. 4 Mk. I* (T) sniper rifles. The Holland & Holland conversions usually have the contractor code \"S51\" on the underside of the buttstock. BSA Shirley undertook 100 conversions to .22\". James Purdey and Sons fitted special buttstocks later in the war. About 3,000 rifles, mostly Stevens-Savage, appear to have been partially converted by Holland & Holland but never received brackets, scopes of the final \"T\" mark. Canada converted about 1,588 rifles at Small Arms Limited (to the end of 1945) and, in 1946, at Canadian Arsenals Limited. Both were located at Long Branch, Ontario. Most of the Canadian made No.4 Mk.I* (T) sniper equipments went into British service. The No.4 (T) rifles were extensively employed in various conflicts until the late 1960s.\n\nThe British military switched over to the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] round in the 1950s; starting in 1970, over 1,000 of the No. 4 Mk I (T) and No. 4 Mk.

These conversions were prompted by firearms legislation that made possession of a rifle chambered in a military cartridge both difficult and expensive. Smoothbored shotguns could be legally held with far less trouble.\n\nRFI, in India, converted a large number of MkIII rifles to single shot muskets, chambered for the .410 Indian Musket cartridge. These conversions were for issue to police and prison guards, to provide a firearm with a much-reduced power and range in comparison to the .303 cartridge. A further likely consideration was the difficulty of obtaining replacement ammunition in the event of the rifle's theft or the carrier's desertion.\n\nWhile British and Australian conversions were to the standard commercially available .410 shotgun cartridge (though of varying chamber lengths) the Indian conversions have been the source of considerable confusion. The Indian conversions were originally chambered for the .410 Indian Musket cartridge, which is based on the .303 British cartridge, and will not chamber the common .410 shotgun cartridge. Many of these muskets were rechambered, after being sold as surplus, and can now be used with commercially available ammunition. Unmodified muskets require handloading of ammunition, as the .410 Indian Musket cartridge was not commercially distributed and does not appear to have been manufactured since the 1950s.\n\nNumerous attempts have been made to convert the various single-shot .410 shotgun models to a bolt-action repeating model by removing the wooden magazine plug and replacing it with a standard 10-round SMLE magazine. None of these is known to have been successful,{{sfn|Griffiths|1998}} though some owners have adapted 3-round magazines for [[Savage Arms|Savage]] and [[Stevens Arms|Stevens]] shotguns to function in a converted SMLE shotgun, or even placing such a magazine inside a gutted SMLE magazine.\n\n===Civilian conversions and variants===\nFrom the late 1940s, legislation in New South Wales, Australia, heavily restricted .303 British calibre (and other \"military calibre\") rifles,{{sfn|Enright|1998}} so large numbers of SMLEs were converted to \"wildcat\" calibres such as [[.303/25]], [[.303/22]], .303/270 and the popular [[7.7\u00d754mm]] round.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=351}} 303/25 calibre sporterised SMLEs are very common in Australia today, although ammunition for them has been very scarce since the 1980s.{{sfn|Enright|1998}} The restrictions placed on \"military calibre\" rifles in New South Wales were lifted in 1975, and many people who had converted their Lee\u2013Enfields to the \"wildcat\" rounds converted their rifles back to .303 British.{{sfn|Enright|1998}} Post-Second World War, SAF Lithgow converted a number of SMLE rifles to commercial sporting rifles- notably the .22 Hornet model- under the \"Slazenger\" brand.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=549}}\n\nIn the early 1950s Essential Agencies Ltd. (E.A.L.), of Toronto, Ontario, produced a run of several thousand survival rifles based on the No. 4 action, but lightened and shortened, chambered in .303 British. Serial numbers below 6000 were for civilian sale, serial numbers 6000 and higher were built under contract to the Canadian government. The Royal Canadian Air Force also used these as a survival rifle in the remote parts of Canada.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===L59A1 Drill Rifle===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nThe L59A1 was a conversion of the No4 Rifle (all Marks) to a [[Drill Purpose Rifle]] that was incapable of being restored to a firing configuration. It was introduced in service in the 1970s. A conversion specification of No.1 rifles to L59A2 Drill Purpose was also prepared but was abandoned due to the greater difficulty of machining involved and the negligible numbers still in the hands of cadet units.\n\nThe L59A1 arose from British government concerns over the vulnerability of Army Cadet Force and school [[Combined Cadet Force]]s' (CCF) stocks of small arms to theft by terrorists, in particular the [[Irish Republican Army]] following raids on CCF armouries in the 1950s and 1960s. Previous conversions to Drill Purpose (DP) of otherwise serviceable rifles were not considered to be sufficiently incapable of restoration to fireable state and were a potential source of reconversion spares.\n\nL59A1 Drill Rifles were rendered incapable of being fired, and of being restored to a fireable form, by extensive modifications that included the welding of the barrel to the receiver, modifications to the receiver that removed the supporting structures for the bolt's locking lugs and blocking the installation of an unaltered bolt, the removal of the striker's tip, the blocking of the striker's hole in the bolt head and the removal of most of the bolt body's locking lugs. Most bolts were copper plated for identification. A plug was welded in place forward of the chamber, and a window was cut in the side of the barrel. The stock and fore end was marked with broad white painted bands and the letters \"DP\" for easy identification.\n\n==Special service Lee\u2013Enfields: Commando and automatic models==\n===Charlton Automatic Rifles===\n{{Main|Charlton Automatic Rifle}}\n\n[[File:Charlton Automatic Rifle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Charlton Automatic Rifle.]]\n\nSmall numbers of Lee\u2013Enfield rifles were built as, or converted to, experimental automatic loading systems, such as the British [[Howell Automatic Rifle|Howell]] and South African [[Rieder Automatic Rifle|Rieder]] and the best-known of which was the '''Charlton Automatic Rifle''', designed by a New Zealander, Philip Charlton in 1941 to act as a substitute for the [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] and [[Lewis gun]] light machine guns which were in chronically short supply at the time.{{sfn|Skennerton|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=203}} During the Second World War, the majority of New Zealand's land forces were deployed in North Africa.

The main difference between the two conversions was in the cartridge ejection arrangement; the Enfield magazine carried a hardened steel projection that struck the rim of the extracted case to eject it, the Sterling system employed a spring-loaded plunger inserted into the receiver wall.\n\nThe results of the trials that were conducted on the L8 series rifles were mixed and the British Government and the Ministry of Defence decided not to convert their existing stocks of Lee\u2013Enfield No. 4 rifles to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO. Despite this, the British learned from the results of the L8 test program and used them in successfully converting their stocks of No. 4 (T) sniper rifles to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, which led to the creation of the L42A1 series sniper rifles.{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|pp=260\u2013264}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, RSAF Enfield entered the commercial market by producing No.4-based 7.62\u00d751mm rifles for sale. The products were marketed under alliterative names e.g. Enfield Envoy, a rifle intended for civilian competition target shooting and Enfield Enforcer, a rifle fitted with a Pecar telescopic sight to suit the requirements of police firearms teams.\n\n===Ishapore 2A/2A1===\n{{Main|Ishapore 2A1 rifle}}\n\n[[File:RFI Rifle 7.62mm 2A1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ishapore 2A1.]]\n\nAt some point just after the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962, the Rifle Factory Ishapore in India began producing a new type of rifle known as the '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 2A''', which was based on the SMLE Mk III*{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=515}} and was slightly redesigned to use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round. Externally the new rifle is very similar to the classic Mk III*, with the exception of the buttplate (the buttplate from the 1A SLR is fitted) and magazine, which is more \"square\" than the SMLE magazine, and usually carries twelve rounds instead of ten,{{sfn|Skennerton|2007|p=370}} although a number of 2A1s have been noted with 10-round magazines.\n\nIshapore 2A and Ishapore 2A1 receivers are made with improved (EN) steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62\u00d751mm round){{sfn|Skennerton|2004b|p=5}} and the extractor is redesigned to suit the rimless cartridge. From 1965 to 1975 (when production is believed to have been discontinued), the sight ranging graduations were changed from 2000 to 800, and the rifle re-designated '''Rifle 7.62&nbsp;mm 2A1'''.{{sfn|Skennerton|2004b|p=14}} The original {{convert|2000|yard|m|lk=on}} rear sight arm was found to be suitable for the ballistics of the 7.62\u00d751mm, which is around 10% more powerful and equates to a flatter trajectory than that of the .303 British MkVII ammunition, so it was a simple matter to think of the '2000' as representing metres rather than yards. It was then decided that the limit of the effective range was a more realistic proposition at 800&nbsp;m.\n\nThe Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as \".308 conversions\". The 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles. Rather, they are ''newly manufactured firearms'' and are not technically chambered for commercial .308 Winchester ammunition. However, many 2A/2A1 owners shoot such ammunition in their rifles with no problems, although some factory loaded .308 Winchester cartridges may appear to generate higher pressures than 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, even though the rounds are otherwise interchangeable \u2013 this is due to the different systems of pressure measurement used for NATO and commercial cartridges.\n\n==Production and manufacturers==\nIn total, over 16 million Lee\u2013Enfields had been produced in several factories on different continents when production in Britain shut down in 1956, at the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] [[ROF Fazakerley]] in Liverpool after that factory had been plagued with industrial unrest.

However, the Lee\u2013Enfield was mainly replaced in main-line service in the Pakistani Police in the mid-1980s by the [[AK 47]], in response to increasing proliferation of the Kalashnikov in the black market and civilian use. In [[Jordan]], the Lee\u2013Enfield was in use with the Police and Gendarmerie until 1971, and with the Armed Forces until 1965. In [[Iraq]] and Egypt, the Lee\u2013Enfield was replaced by the Kalashnikov as the standard issue rifle in the Armed Forces by the late 1950s, and in Police Forces by the late 1970s.\nIn the UK, the single-shot .22 calibre Rifle No. 8 is in regular use with UK Cadet Forces as a light target rifle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rifleman.org.uk/Enfield_Rifle_No.8.html |title=Lee\u2013Enfield Rifle No.8 for the British Forces |publisher=UK N.R.A Historic Arms Resource Centre |accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Enfields continue to be used as drill weapons by the National Ceremonial Guard of the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF).<ref name=SANDF>{{cite web|last=Mashamaite|first=Kgabo|url=http://www.dod.mil.za/news/2012/04/2012randshow.htm |title=The SANDF opens the 2012 Rand Easter Show |publisher=South African Department of Defence |date=2012-04-08|accessdate=2016-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229211820/http://www.dod.mil.za/news/2012/04/2012randshow.htm |archivedate=29 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMany Afghan participants in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were armed with Lee\u2013Enfields.<ref>Modern Warfare, Published by Mark Dartford, Marshall Cavendish (London) 1985</ref> The CIA's [[Operation Cyclone]] provided hundreds of thousands of Enfields to the [[Mujahideen]], funneling them through Pakistan's [[Inter Services Intelligence|ISI]].

These would later include the [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], [[Mid-South Wrestling]] and [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] as well as events from around the world.<ref name=\"Apter\"/> Because the show never disclosed that the wrestling being shown was pre-taped, with Pedicino adding commentary later on, fans watching the show at home would often travel to the studio hoping to attend the show. In November, twenty fans drove in a van all the way from [[Snellville, Georgia]] to the [[closed set|locked studio]] in [[downtown Atlanta]] only to be turned away by security.<ref name=\"Darcy\"/> \n\nPedicino served as both [[executive producer]] and host throughout its near 7-year run.

Blackstone had been one of 20 girls, chosen out of a total of 70, to become Pedicino's co-host.<ref name=\"Sneed\"/><ref name=\"Darcy\"/> [[Gordon Solie]], a popular wrestling announcer, also joined the show as a regular [[color commentator]]. Solie would also host a featured segment with Pedicino, \"Pro Wrestling This Week\", which discussed wrestling news from around the country.
