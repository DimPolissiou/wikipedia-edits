His paternal grandparents were [[Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy]] and his German wife [[Polyxena Christina of Hesse-Rotenburg|Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg]]. His maternal grandparents were French born King [[Philip V of Spain]] and his Italian wife, [[Elisabeth Farnese]].\n\nHe was a younger brother of two other rulers of Savoy [[Charles Emmanuel IV of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel IV]] and [[Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy|Victor Emmanuel I]]. He spent his childhood with his sister [[Princess Maria Carolina of Savoy|Maria Carolina]] and his younger brother, Giuseppe Benedetto Placido, Count of Moriana, at the [[Castle of Moncalieri]].\n\nFrom his youth, Carlo Felice was reported as having a very complex character: on the one hand consistent and inflexible, private, distrustful, and impulsive, if not touchy and vindictive; on the other hand honest, sincere, and cabable of emotion and fondness. He had a clever mind, at times even ironic. He possessed a sacral conception of the monarchy and the right to reign.<ref>G. Locorotondo, Carlo Felice, pp.365-366</ref>\n\nDuring the years of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleon italian campaign|Italian Campaign]], Charles Felix formed part of a \"parallel court\" opposed to Charles Emmanuel IV's circle, along with his brother Victor Emmanuel, the latter's wife [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, Queen of Sardinia|Maria Theresa]], Maurizio Giuseppe Duke of Monferrat, and Giuseppe Placido, count of Moriana.<ref>A. Segre, Vittorio Emanuele I, p. 42</ref>\n\nIn this period, Charles Felix began to keep a personal diary, which is an important source for events and for his conflicts with the court in Savoy.\n\n== The Italian campaign (1792-1798) ==\nWhen war broke out with France, Charles Felix did not distinguish himself as a soldier, despite having received a military education. In 1792, after the French occupation of the Duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, he followed the troops to [[Saluzzo]] and in 1793, he accompanied his father, Victor Amadeus III, who had directed the operations for the reconquest of Nice and Savoy along with the Austrians under general J. de Vins, into the  [[Susa Valley]], to [[Pinerolo]], [[Cuneo]], and [[Tende]].\n\nCharles Felix remained very far from the front lines in any case. In spring 1794, after the arrival in Aosta of his brother the Duke of Monferrat, Charles Felix and Giuseppe Placido went to [[Morgex]] in order to retake some positions of relative strategic importance, but they did not achieve anything.<ref>S. Costa di Beauregard, Unhomme d'autrefois, Paris 1877, p. 274</ref>\n\nOn 28 April 1796, Victor Amadeus III was forced to sign the [[Armistice of Cherasco]] with the French, which was followed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1796)|Treaty of Paris]] on 15 May, which accepted French control of Nice, Savoy, Genevoise, and some fortresses. Charles Felix, who had been titled Duke of Genoa, obtained the title of Marquis of Susa in compensation for his nominal loss.\n\nVictor Amadeus III died in October of the same year and was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by Charles Emmanuel IV. The relationship between the new king and Charles Felix had never been good, but now deteriorated as the king strove to keep his brothers in the dark about affairs of state.\n\nTwo years into his reign, Charles Emmanuel IV was forced to surrender all royal control on the mainland. Along with the king and the rest of the royal family, Charles Felix left Turin on the evening of 9 December 1798 for [[Cagliari]], where they arrived on 3 March 1799.\n\n== Viceroy of Sardinia (1799-1814) ==\n[[File:Charles Felix as the Grand Master of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Felix as the Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]]]]\nCharles Emmanuel IV was childless and, after the death of his wife, he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I on 4 June 1802. The latter did not take possession of the domains in Sardinia himself, preferring to entrust them to Charles Felix as viceroy.\n\nCharles Felix's government of Sardinia was rather rigid and authoritarian. Since the {{ill|Sardinian revolutionary movements|it|Moti rivoluzionari sardi}} in 1794, the island had experienced a period of disorder, exacerbated by widespread poverty, which had led to an increase in crime, which the viceroy suppressed with notable harshness, writing to his brother the king, \"slaughter, slaughter, for the good of the human race.\"<ref name=\"Montanellip.344\">{{harvnb|Indro Montanelli|p.344}}.</ref>\n\nCharles Felix established a military regime, such that his Sardinian subjects referred to him as \"Carlo Feroce\" (Charles the Ferocious). The tool of this regime was the special court of the Viceregal delegation for the investigation of political proceedings, which took action immediately against the \"capopolo\" (popular leader), [[Vincenzo Sulis]], who was guilty of nothing other than having been more successful than the viceroy in defeating the revolutionary movements. When Sulis was condemned to twenty years in gaol, the viceroy considered it a lenient sentence. Furthermore, in the persecution of \"state criminals,\" Charles Felix legitimated the adoption of military procedures and granted every power to the police, from spying, to censoring letters and placing bounties on suspects.<ref name= Montanellip.344 />\n\nIn his reorganisation work, however, he displayed notable energy to control the autonomy of the judiciary and the local bureaucracy and managed to correct some abuses of the feudal regime.<ref name= Treccani >{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-felice-di-savoia-re-di-sardegna_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Carlo Felice di Savoia|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, when the [[Stamenti]], the parliament of the kingdom, voted to pay a tax of 400,000 lire, Charles Felix exerted significant pressure to have the poorest classes exempted from the tax and he judged disputes in feudal jurisdiction in favour of vassals rather than feudal lords.<ref name= Treccani /> When an anti-feudal revolt took place against the Duke of [[Asinara]], who had refused to conform to the regulations of the viceroy, Charles Felix decided to punish both the duke, who was stripped of his property, as well as the revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usini.virtuale.org/la_rivolta_antifeudale.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608165651/http://www.usini.virtuale.org/la_rivolta_antifeudale.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 June 2008|title=Storia di Usini, la Rivolta anti-feudale|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the precarious political and social situation, Charles Felix was able to bring some improvements to the agriculture and economy of the island. Under his rule, an agrarian society and an office for the administration of Crown mines and forests were established. Additionally, the farming of olives was encouraged and commercial contracts were granted in order to encourage local production. Finally, he began a project to systematise the road network.<ref name= Testedistoria >{{cite web|url=http://testedistoria.blogspot.it/2011/12/carlo-felice-di-savoia-il-re-per-caso.html|title=Teste di storia: Carlo Felice di Savoia, il re per caso|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and return to Turin (1814-1821)==\n[[File:Portrait of Maria Cristina of Naples, queen of Sardinia (1779-1849) circa 1828-1831.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Maria Cristina of Naples, wife of Charles Felix and queen of Sardinia]]\nOn 7 March 1807, in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] in [[Palermo]], Charles Felix married by [[proxy marriage|proxy]]  [[Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily]] (17 January 1779 - 11 March 1849), daughter of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] King of Naples and Sicily and [[Maria Carolina of Austria]].\n\nThe marriage which had originally been opposed by Charles Felix, had been arranged or dynastic reasons. Neither Charles Emmanuel nor Victor Emmanuel had male children (the son of the latter had become sick and died in Sardinia), while the Duke of Montferrat and the Count of Morian were deceased, so Charles Felix had become the heir presumptive and therefore had to produce a male heir.\n\nAlthough the marriage to Maria Cristina proved harmonious, she was unable to have children, forcing Victor Emmanuel to consider the succession of [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]], prince of Carignano, from a collateral line of the House of Savoy.<ref>{{harvnb|Indro Montanelli|p.309}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon and the return of Victor Emmanuel to Turin on 20 May 1814, Charles Felix joined him for a brief period before returning to Sardinia the following year with his wife. He formally retained the role of Viceroy until 1821, although he returned to the court in Turin after a short period.\n\n== Revolution of 1821 ==\n=== Origin ===\nFollowing revolts in [[Cadiz]] in 1820, King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] was forced to restore the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and hope of obtaining similar concessions from their own sovereigns arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo.\n\nThe initial indications of crisis were confirmed on 11 January 1821 when four students were stopped by the police at a theatre performance in Turin because they were wearing red caps with black bows, symbol of the carboneria. The young men offered resistance and were arrested, provoking a large brawl.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 300}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, all the students and many of their teachers protested, calling for the release of the youths and, when this was refused, they blockaded themselves in the university and the government was forced to call in the army. Although nobody was killed, the wounded were very numerous and the situation escalated.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 301}}</ref>\n\nA connection was made between the protestors and the secret society of the \"Federati\", whose leaders [[Annibale Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Count of Santarosa|Santorre di Rossi]], [[Giacinto Collegno]], Carlo Emanuele Asinari, and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi (all soldiers, officials, or sons of ministers) and [[Roberto d'Azeglio]] met with Charles Albert on 6 March. They were ready to act, having identified the prince as a new man for the House of Savoy, who might be willing to break with the absolutist past.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|p. 63}}</ref>\n\nThe goal of the conspirators was not to abolish the House of Savoy, but to induce it to enact political and social reforms and then undertake a war against Austria, which seemed possible in light of the deeply anti-Austrian sentiments of the Victor Emmanuel I.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 302}}</ref>\n\nIn this, the conspirators took advantage of the absence of Charles Felix, whom they thought would have been able to induce Victor Emmanuel to oppose their plans. They planned to raise the army, surround the royal residence at Moncalieri castle and force him to grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. The role of Charles Albert would have been to mediate between the conspirators and the king,<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 65, 76}}</ref> but the following morning, he changed his mind and attempted to escape from the conspirators, although he did not disavow them.\n\n=== Beginning of the revolt ===\nThe conspirators grew suspicious and prepared to cancel the insurrection which they had planned for the 10th. The same day, Charles Albert, completely penitent, raced to Moncalieri in order to confess everything to Victor Emmanuel and beg for pardon. In the night the garrison of [[Alessandria]], commanded by one of the conspirators, Guglielmo Ansaldi, rebelled and occupied the city. Although they had been abandoned by the Prince, the rest of the revolutionaries decided to act at this point.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 75-79}}</ref>\n\n=== Abdication of Victor Emmanuel and regency of Charles Albert ===\n[[File:Bernero - Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Victor Emmanuel I]], who abdicated in favour of Charles Felix after the rebellion of 1821]]\nOn Sunday 11 March 1821, King Victor Emmanuel I met with the Crown Council, which Charles Albert was a member of. As a result of the king's indecision, no action was taken.\n\nOn 12 March, the [[Citadel of Turin]] fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel encouraged Charles Albert and [[Cesare Balbo]] to negotiate with the Carbonari, who refused to listen to their messages. Thus, in the evening, in the face of the spreading military uprising, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in [[Modena]] at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 85-89, 98}}</ref>\n\nThe abdication of the king, which followed the dismissal of the ministers of state, led to chaos because it created a dynastic crisis which foreign powers would not ignore and because it split the army and bureaucracy, preventing every possibility of maintaining order.\n\nThe regent tried to take control by naming a new government (the lawyer, Ferdinando del Pozzo (1768-1843) as Minister of the Intrior, general Emanuele Pes di Villamarina as minister of war, and Lodovico Sauli d'Igliano as minister of foreign affairs) and attempted to negotiate with the rebels, but he achieved nothing.\n\nGiven the impossibility of taking any decisions without the agreement of the new king, Charles Albert sent Charles Felix an account of the events, seeking instructions, but the letter took a very long time to reach its destination.\n\nFearful of becoming the object of popular anger, on the evening of 13 March 1821, Charles Albert signed a decree granting a constitution along the lines of the Spanish constitution of 1812, which would not become law until approved by the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 91-95}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, the regent decided to form a junta, which was to protect the parliament. Two days after that, he swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, in a Savoyard version which had been slightly altered according to the requests of Victor Emmanuel's consort, [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, Queen of Sardinia|Maria Therese]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 95-96}}</ref>\n\n===Intervention of Charles Felix ===\nAt this point, Charles Felix, who had now received the letter from Charles Albert notifying him of his brother's abdication, decided to act. He told the messenger not to address him as \"majesty\", then asserted that since the abdication had been extracted through violence, it could not be considered valid. Finally, he said, \"tell the Prince that, if there is still a drop of our royal blood in his veins, he should set out for Novara immediately and wait there for my orders.\"\n\nAs for the Spanish constitution, he declared any sovereign acts taken after the abdication of his brother to be null and void, then he issued the following proclamation, \"Far from consenting to any change in the pre-existing form of government with the nominal abdication of the king, our beloved brother, we consider all the royal subjects who have aided or abetted the traitors or who have presumed to proclaim a constitution, to be rebels.\"\n\nCharles Albert, deeply discouraged, did as Charles Felix commanded, went to Novara, and issued a proclamation renouncing the regency and calling on everyone to submit to Charles Felix. On the 29th, he received a letter from Charles Felix ordering him to depart with his family for Florence.\n\nWith Charles Albert out of the way, Charles Felix dispatched several letters to [[Francis I of Austria]], asking him to send troops in order to suppress the revolt.\n\nOn 3 April, he issued a second proclamation which granted a pardon to the soldiers while applying strict sanctions to rebel officials, which ultimately, prevented any form of compromise. Chancellor [[Metternich]] himself said to [[Francis IV of Modena]] that this proclamation had been imprudent and was written \"with animosity, passion, and hatred.\"\n\nThe rebels, realising that no other option remained for them, marched on Novara, where the forces loyal to Charles Felix were gathered under the command of [[Vittorio Sallier de La Tour]]. This, inevitably, convinced Metternich to intervene.\n\nOn 8 April there was a battle with (Noara-Borgo Vercelli) with the troops of de La Tour and then with those of the Austrian general Ferdinand von Bubna, who occupied Vercelli and Alessandria on 11 April, while de La Tour, who had received full powers from Charles Felix, occupied Turin on the 10th.\n\nOn 19 April, despite pressure from the emperors of Russia and Austria, Metternich, Charles Albert, Francis IV, and Charles Felix himself (who hated the idea of receiving the crown \"thanks\" to rebels), Victor Emmanuel reaffirmed his abdication. Thus, on 25 April, Charles Felix acceded to the throne.\n\n===Suppression===\nOnce control of Turin was re-established, Charles Felix, who was still in Modena, entered into personal communication with the Emperor of Austria in order to obtain recognition from the [[Congress of Laibach]], which was then in session, that he would be able to assume full control of his possessions, as an absolute monarch, and that Austria would not be allowed to interfere in any way in his territories.\n\nAt the subsequent [[Congress of Verona]], Charles Felix feared pressure for constitutional changes and reiterated in his instructions to his ambassadors that the repression of the \"revolutionary spirit\" inspired by the Congress of Laibach belonged exclusively to him and that he was firmly convinced of the necessity of this obligation.\n\nHaving decided to remain at Modena, he appointed [[Ignazio Thaon di Revel]] as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, and placed G. Piccono della Valle and G.C. Brignole in charge of foreign affairs and financial affairs respectively.\n\nFinally, he began the suppression of opposition. The following extract from the work of [[Guido Astuti]] describes his actions:\n{{quotation|The new king, Charles Felix, let loose a reaction with arbitrary repressive methods, using extraordinary commissions to judge the rebels and establishing political investigators in order to purge the army and the bureaucracy|G. Astuti, ''Gli ordinamenti giuridici degli Stati sabaudi'', p. 544.}}\n\nFinally, the king instituted three different jurisdictions: a mixed civil and military tribunal called the Royal Delegation with penal powers, a military commission for investigating the conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers, and a scrutiny commission for investigating the conduct of every employee of the kingdom.\n\nThe Royal Delegation sat from 7 May to early October, in which time it issued 71 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and 20 sentences of imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. After the delegation's dissolution, the senate issued a further 24 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and another 12 sentences of imprisonment for 15\u201320 years. By the end of October the military commission had dismissed 627 officers.<ref name= \"Testedistoria\" />\n\nThe scrutiny commission, divided into a superior tribunal and seven divisional boards of scrutiny, issued numerous dismissals and suspensions of cvil servants and professors of every kind of school, whom it found particularly culpable.<ref name= \"Testedistoria\" />\n\nOn the instructions of the minister of the interior, Roget de Cholex, the University of Turin was closed and many professors received severe admonitions because, as the king wrote in a letter to his brother (9 May 1822): \"everyone who has studied at the university is entirely corrupt: the professors are detestable, but there is no way to replace them... Thus the bad are all taught and the good are all ignorant.\".<ref>Corrado Vivanti, Et\u00e0 Contemporanea, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn any case, although an oppressive climate was established,<ref>{{harvnb|Perrero|pp. 288\u2013293}}</ref> accompanied by the habituation to accusations and to the diversity of political ideas, offering a pretext for pursuing private vendettas,<ref>Rosario Romeo, ''Dal Piemonte sabaudo all'Italia liberale''. Torino, Einaudi, 1963, p.33</ref> the royal authority, especially the governor of Genoa, [[Giorgio Des Geneys]], did not prevent people from fleeing. Of all the people who were condemned, only two were actually executed.<ref name=\"Cita|Montanelli|p. 344\">{{harvb|Montanelli|p. 344}}</ref>\n\nFurther, it is reported by a letter of the Count d'Agli\u00e8 that Charles Felix never prevented anyone from secretly passing subsidies to condemned men who had gone into exile and [[Angelo Brofferio]] reports that when the king discovered that one of these subsidies was going to the family of one of the two individuals who had actually been executed in 1821, the king doubled the sum.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 351}}</ref>\n\nThe suppression of opposition was terminated on 30 September 1821, when Charles Felix issued a pardon of all individuals who had been implicated in the revolt, excluding the leaders, the financiers and those who had been found guilty of homicide or extortion. A few days later, Charles Felix entered Turin.\n\n==Reign (1821-1831)==\nEven before he reached Turin, Charles Felix repudiated the Regent's promise and, to help restore order, he called in the Austrians, who stayed in Piedmont till 1823. In that same year Charles Albert went to Spain to extinguish by force of arms the last sparks of revolt, making himself an object of hatred as the betrayer of Italian liberalism, but regaining the confidence of the King, who might have chosen another successor.\n\nCharles Felix was a true reactionary, convinced that the world would soon be swept clean of all those - in his view - wicked and sacrilegious innovations introduced by the French Revolution and diffused throughout Europe by Napoleon Bonaparte \"the rascal\" as he called him.\n\n=== Internal policy ===\n[[File:Carlo Felice 1 lira genova.jpg|thumb|Charles Felix depicted on a 1 [[Sardinian lira|lira]] coin of 1828]]\nCharles Felix was rarely present at Turin as king and did not participate in the social life of the capital, since he had never sought the throne and had no particular affection for the Turinese, whom he considered to have proven themselves traitors to the dynasty through their support for Napoleon and the constitutional protests.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 350}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, he resided in Turin only during the theatre season<ref name=\"Cita|Montanelli|p. 344\"/> and he spent the rest of the time travelling around Savoy, Nice, Genoa (one of his favourite residences) and the castles of [[Govone Castle|Govone]] and [[Ducal castle of Agli\u00e8|Agli\u00e8]], which he had inherited from his sister Maria Anna.\n\nAs a result, the king tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior,<!--What a slime! If an autocrat refuses to delegate power to the people, the least they can do is actually exercise the power themselves...--> reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by [[Massimo d'Azeglio]] as follows:\n\n{{quotation|A despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honour, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.|Massimo d'Azeglio, citato in Montanelli, ''L'Italia Giacobina e Carbonara'', p. 344.}}\n\nNevertheless, the king was not entirely unaware of the need for reform and certainly exerted himself in the defense of the Piedmontese realm from Pontifical and foreign intervetion. He limited the privileges and exemptions of the church, which seemed harmful to the state, almost completely abolishing the right of sanctuary in holy places, granted secular courts the right to hear cases against priests, and imposed civic oversight of [[catechism]]s, sermons, and religious books.\n\nRegarding the issue of church property which had been secularised in 1792 (with Papal consent) and Francisican property which had been secularised unilaterally, the king appointed an extraordinary board composed of official and supporters of the clergy.\nThe proposals, delivered to [[Pope Leo XII]] by ambassador-extraordinary [[Filiberto Avogadro di Collobiano]] in December 1827, were examined by a council of cardinals, who rejected some financial details and the right of the state to dispose of the property freely. However, on 1 April 1828, the king summoned a new council, to which he professed flexibility on the financial issues and rigidity on the issue of disposal. The resulting agreement was approved on 14 May 1828 by the Holy See.<ref>F Lemmi, Carlo Felice, Torino, 1931, p. 221.</ref>\n\nThere were also important legislative reforms, which were effected by the Edict of 16 July 1822, which reformed mortgages; the Edict of 27 August 1822, which unified the military penal law; and the Edict of 27 September 1822, which reformed the judicial system. These changes were capped by the ''Civil and Criminal Laws of the Kingdom of Sardinia'', signed on 16 January 1827, which replaced the dated [[Carta de Logu]].\n\n{{quotation|Charles Felix, like every man of the Restoration, which simultaneously included both reactionaries and reformers, had had a great variety of experiences and appeared to oscillate between the open revival of eighteenth century despotism, which had come to an end with the Napoleonic state, and historic innovations, which had little luck in Italy, however... On the one hand there was a typical effort to update dynastic absolutism, on the other hand there was substantial adoption of the Frence system - with exceptions and modifications.|E. Genta, Eclettismo giuridico della Restaurazione, pp.357-362.}}\n\nIn fact, while Victor Emmanuel had implemented a rigid counter-revolution, which uncritically revoked every arrangement made by the French after the abdication of Charles Emmanuel IV, the state could not continue to ignore the will of the majority of its subjects who called for laws in accordance with the ideas and needs of their contemporary world. Some reforms to fill the gaps were necessary.<ref>F. Sclopis, ''Storia della legislazione italiana dall'epoca della Rivoluzione francese, 1789, a quella delle Riforme italiane, 1847'', p.206.</ref>\n\nThus, on 27 September 1822, after Charles Felix had re-established the publication of mortgages and codified the military penal law, he promulgated an Edict on the reform of the civil judicial system - excluding Sardinia.\n\nThe edict abolished a majority of the special jurisdictions (e.g. for gambling offences, or management of ports), instituted 40 collegial prefecture tribunals (which managed 416 \"district courts\"), with [[original jurisdiction]], which were divided into four classes, according to the importance of the area, and he entrusted instruction of the procedures to special members of these tribunals. Civil and penal jurisdiction remained with the Senate in Turin and fiscal jurisdiction with the [[Court of Audit (Italy)|Court of Audit]].<ref>Piola Caselli, ''La Magistratura.

Taruffo, ''La giustizia civile in Italia dal \u2018700 ad oggi'', p.94</ref>\n\nFinally, he made the act of taking a case to court free, however inadequately, replacing the old system of the ''sportula'', which was a very heavy judicial fee, calculated on the basis of the seriousness of the case, which provided the judges' pay, with a regular system of salaries paid by the state.<ref>P. Saraceno, ''Storia della magistratura italiana. Le origini \u2013 la magistratura nel Regno di Sardegna'', pp.40-41.</ref>\n\nAnother important change was the code of civil and criminal law of the Kingdom of Sardinia promulgated on 16 January 1827, mainly as a result of the work of the Count of Cholex. The code was prepared in Turin by the Supreme Council of Sardinia. It was then examined by an appropriate Sardinian committee and the [[Real Audiencia#Audiencias in Italy|Reale Udienza]] of Sardinia. The result was a confection of Sardinian and mainland sources, creating a law which was both traditional and novel.<ref>. G. Manno, ''Biografia di S. A. R. il duca del Genevese poscia re C. F., in Note sarde e ricordi'', Torino 1868, p. 288</ref>\n\nThe most novel changes relate to penal law: the abolition of the ''giudatico'' (impunity for criminals who had arrested other criminals) and the ''esemplarit\u00e0'' (cruel extensions of the death penalty, like [[hung, drawn, and quartered|quartering]] the corpse and scattering the ashes); restrictions on the imposition of the death penalty; affirmation of the principle that the punishment should fit the crime; and the distinction between attempted crimes and crimes actually committed.<ref>C. Sole,''La Sardegna di Carlo Felice e il problema della terra'', Cagliari 1967 p.65</ref>\n\nFinally, the slave trade was abolished and it was declared that any person who was found in captivity on a ship flying the Sardinian flag would instantly be freed.<ref>A. Imeroni, ''I re di Sardegna pel riscatto degli schiavi dai Barbareschi'', in Rass. stor. d. Risorg., XXII (1935), pp. 580-588.</ref>\n\n=== Economic initiatives ===\n[[File:Genoa (25).jpg|thumb|250px|The Teatro Carlo Felice, Genoa]]\nCharles Felix's reign was characterised by financial and economic difficulties and rigid protectionism, but there were some initiatives relating to services and public works.\n\nThe road network was improved by the construction of the road between [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]] (now [[Strada statale 131 Charles Felix]]) and between Genoa and Nice, as well as bridges over the [[Bormida (river)|Bormida]] and the [[Ticino]] (the latter completed in 1828). A large number of public buildings were constructed in the cities: the port of Nice was largely restored, Genoa received a theatre (the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], named after the king), and Turin benefited from a programme of urban improvement which included the bridge over the [[Dora Riparia|Dora]], the [[Piazza Carlo Felice]], underground drainage channels, the porticos of the [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]] and various new suburbs.\n\nCharles Felix paid attention to the steelworking sector, which had already occupied him as Viceroy, as well as the banking and insurance sectors, which were improved significantly by the creation of the [[Cassa di Risparmio di Torino]] in 1827 and the establishment of the [[Reale Mutua Assicurazioni|Royal Mutual Society of Insurers]] in June 1829. He also encouraged the agricultural and manufacturing sector by granting lots of exemptions and fiscal benefits and through the creation of [[trade fair]]s like that of 1829, in which 500 exhibitors participated.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n{{see also|Battle of Tripoli (1825)}}\nTheoretically, Charles Felix was committed to the territorial expansion of his realm, but he did not maintain any expansionist illusions and preferred to concentrate on the economic and commercial interests of his realm.<ref>F. Lemmi, ''La politica estera di Carlo Alberto nei suoi primi anni di regno'', Firenze 1928, p. 93.</ref><ref>Bianchi, Storia della Diplomazia, II, p.77.</ref> Thus in 1821, with the help of the Austrians and English, he signed an advantageous trade agreement with the [[Sublime Porte]].\n\nIn September 1825, in order to force the [[Bey of Tripoli]] to observe the treaty established with him in 1816 under English auspices, and to respect Sardinian ships sailing along the coast of North Africa, he launched a demonstration of force. Towards the end of the month, two frigates (''Commercio'' and ''Cristina''), a corvette (''Tritone'') and a brig (''Nereide'') under the command of captain [[Francesco Sivori]], appeared off the coast of Tripoli. After a final attempt to pressure the Bey diplomatically, ten Sardinian longboats sailed into the harbour on the night of 27 September and set fire to a Tripolitanian brig and two schooners, routing or murdering the Tripolitanian troops. This forced the Bey to take a more conciliatory approach.<ref>Account from Am. Des Geneys, ''Arch. di Stato di Torino''</ref>\n\nIn 1828, he ended the construction of a bridge over the River Ticino at [[Boffalora sopra Ticino|Boffalora]], which had been begun by his brother Victor Emmanuel I some years earlier as a result of a treaty with the Emperor of Austria, who controlled the other side of the river as part of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia]].\n\n=== Patronage ===\n[[File:Carlo Felice Savoy Sardinia Hautecombe.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles Felix, [[Hautecombe Abbey]]]]\nCharles Felix was an avid patron of art and culture. In 1824, he acquired [[Hautecombe Abbey]], where many of his ancestors were buried and entrusted a restoration programme to the architect [[Ernesto Melano]].\n\nIn the same year, he was responsible for the acquisition of a good part of the collection which now constitutes the [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin. The pieces were acquired from [[Bernardino Drovetti]], a native of [[Barbania]], who was then the French [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Egypt. The collection was placed in the [[Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze (Turin)|Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze]], which is still the site of the museum.\n\nIn 1827, Charles Felix instituted the chamber of commerce and the School of Palaeography and Diplomacy, affiliated to the academy of painting and sculpture.\n\n==Death and succession==\nCharles Felix died without issue on 27 April 1831, in Turin at the [[Palazzo Chablais]] which had been given to him by his sister [[Princess Maria Anna of Savoy|Princess Maria Anna, Duchess of Chablais]], after a reign of ten years. He was buried at Hautecombe Abbey in Savoy, where his wife was also buried in 1849. With his death, the main line of the [[House of Savoy]] became extinct. He was succeeded by the senior male member of the House of Savoy-Carignano, the regent [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]] (1798-1849). The selection of Charles Albert as successor had not been made willingly, since Charles Albert had shown himself to be inclined to liberalism and friendly to the carbonari.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]] is named for him.\n\nThe principal road of the island of [[Sardinia]], the [[Strada statale 131 Charles Felix]], which connects the towns of [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]]-[[Porto Torres]], constructed in the 19th century, is named for him.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA26|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=26}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His paternal grandparents were [[Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy]] and his German wife [[Polyxena Christina of Hesse-Rotenburg|Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg]]. His maternal grandparents were French born King [[Philip V of Spain]] and his Italian wife, [[Elisabeth Farnese]].\n\nHe was a younger brother of two other rulers of Savoy [[Charles Emmanuel IV of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel IV]] and [[Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy|Victor Emmanuel I]]. He spent his childhood with his sister [[Princess Maria Carolina of Savoy|Maria Carolina]] and his younger brother, Giuseppe Benedetto Placido, Count of Moriana, at the [[Castle of Moncalieri]].\n\nFrom his youth, Carlo Felice was reported as having a very complex character: on the one hand consistent and inflexible, private, distrustful, and impulsive, if not touchy and vindictive; on the other hand honest, sincere, and cabable of emotion and fondness. He had a clever mind, at times even ironic. He possessed a sacral conception of the monarchy and the right to reign.<ref>G. Locorotondo, Carlo Felice, pp.365-366</ref>\n\nDuring the years of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleon italian campaign|Italian Campaign]], Charles Felix formed part of a \"parallel court\" opposed to Charles Emmanuel IV's circle, along with his brother Victor Emmanuel, the latter's wife [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, Queen of Sardinia|Maria Theresa]], Maurizio Giuseppe Duke of Monferrat, and Giuseppe Placido, count of Moriana.<ref>A. Segre, Vittorio Emanuele I, p. 42</ref>\n\nIn this period, Charles Felix began to keep a personal diary, which is an important source for events and for his conflicts with the court in Savoy.\n\n== The Italian campaign (1792-1798) ==\nWhen war broke out with France, Charles Felix did not distinguish himself as a soldier, despite having received a military education. In 1792, after the French occupation of the Duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, he followed the troops to [[Saluzzo]] and in 1793, he accompanied his father, Victor Amadeus III, who had directed the operations for the reconquest of Nice and Savoy along with the Austrians under general J. de Vins, into the  [[Susa Valley]], to [[Pinerolo]], [[Cuneo]], and [[Tende]].\n\nCharles Felix remained very far from the front lines in any case. In spring 1794, after the arrival in Aosta of his brother the Duke of Monferrat, Charles Felix and Giuseppe Placido went to [[Morgex]] in order to retake some positions of relative strategic importance, but they did not achieve anything.<ref>S. Costa di Beauregard, Unhomme d'autrefois, Paris 1877, p. 274</ref>\n\nOn 28 April 1796, Victor Amadeus III was forced to sign the [[Armistice of Cherasco]] with the French, which was followed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1796)|Treaty of Paris]] on 15 May, which accepted French control of Nice, Savoy, Genevoise, and some fortresses. Charles Felix, who had been titled Duke of Genoa, obtained the title of Marquis of Susa in compensation for his nominal loss.\n\nVictor Amadeus III died in October of the same year and was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by Charles Emmanuel IV. The relationship between the new king and Charles Felix had never been good, but now deteriorated as the king strove to keep his brothers in the dark about affairs of state.\n\nTwo years into his reign, Charles Emmanuel IV was forced to surrender all royal control on the mainland. Along with the king and the rest of the royal family, Charles Felix left Turin on the evening of 9 December 1798 for [[Cagliari]], where they arrived on 3 March 1799.\n\n== Viceroy of Sardinia (1799-1814) ==\n[[File:Charles Felix as the Grand Master of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Felix as the Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]]]]\nCharles Emmanuel IV was childless and, after the death of his wife, he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I on 4 June 1802. The latter did not take possession of the domains in Sardinia himself, preferring to entrust them to Charles Felix as viceroy.\n\nCharles Felix's government of Sardinia was rather rigid and authoritarian. Since the {{ill|Sardinian revolutionary movements|it|Moti rivoluzionari sardi}} in 1794, the island had experienced a period of disorder, exacerbated by widespread poverty, which had led to an increase in crime, which the viceroy suppressed with notable harshness, writing to his brother the king, \"slaughter, slaughter, for the good of the human race.\"<ref name=\"Montanellip.344\">{{harvnb|Indro Montanelli|p.344}}.</ref>\n\nCharles Felix established a military regime, such that his Sardinian subjects referred to him as \"Carlo Feroce\" (Charles the Ferocious). The tool of this regime was the special court of the Viceregal delegation for the investigation of political proceedings, which took action immediately against the \"capopolo\" (popular leader), [[Vincenzo Sulis]], who was guilty of nothing other than having been more successful than the viceroy in defeating the revolutionary movements. When Sulis was condemned to twenty years in gaol, the viceroy considered it a lenient sentence. Furthermore, in the persecution of \"state criminals,\" Charles Felix legitimated the adoption of military procedures and granted every power to the police, from spying, to censoring letters and placing bounties on suspects.<ref name= Montanellip.344 />\n\nIn his reorganisation work, however, he displayed notable energy to control the autonomy of the judiciary and the local bureaucracy and managed to correct some abuses of the feudal regime.<ref name= Treccani >{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-felice-di-savoia-re-di-sardegna_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Carlo Felice di Savoia|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, when the [[Stamenti]], the parliament of the kingdom, voted to pay a tax of 400,000 lire, Charles Felix exerted significant pressure to have the poorest classes exempted from the tax and he judged disputes in feudal jurisdiction in favour of vassals rather than feudal lords.<ref name= Treccani /> When an anti-feudal revolt took place against the Duke of [[Asinara]], who had refused to conform to the regulations of the viceroy, Charles Felix decided to punish both the duke, who was stripped of his property, as well as the revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usini.virtuale.org/la_rivolta_antifeudale.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608165651/http://www.usini.virtuale.org/la_rivolta_antifeudale.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 June 2008|title=Storia di Usini, la Rivolta anti-feudale|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the precarious political and social situation, Charles Felix was able to bring some improvements to the agriculture and economy of the island. Under his rule, an agrarian society and an office for the administration of Crown mines and forests were established. Additionally, the farming of olives was encouraged and commercial contracts were granted in order to encourage local production. Finally, he began a project to systematise the road network.<ref name= Testedistoria >{{cite web|url=http://testedistoria.blogspot.it/2011/12/carlo-felice-di-savoia-il-re-per-caso.html|title=Teste di storia: Carlo Felice di Savoia, il re per caso|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and return to Turin (1814-1821)==\n[[File:Portrait of Maria Cristina of Naples, queen of Sardinia (1779-1849) circa 1828-1831.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Maria Cristina of Naples, wife of Charles Felix and queen of Sardinia]]\nOn 7 March 1807, in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] in [[Palermo]], Charles Felix married by [[proxy marriage|proxy]]  [[Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily]] (17 January 1779 - 11 March 1849), daughter of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] King of Naples and Sicily and [[Maria Carolina of Austria]].\n\nThe marriage which had originally been opposed by Charles Felix, had been arranged or dynastic reasons. Neither Charles Emmanuel nor Victor Emmanuel had male children (the son of the latter had become sick and died in Sardinia), while the Duke of Montferrat and the Count of Morian were deceased, so Charles Felix had become the heir presumptive and therefore had to produce a male heir.\n\nAlthough the marriage to Maria Cristina proved harmonious, she was unable to have children, forcing Victor Emmanuel to consider the succession of [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]], prince of Carignano, from a collateral line of the House of Savoy.<ref>{{harvnb|Indro Montanelli|p.309}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon and the return of Victor Emmanuel to Turin on 20 May 1814, Charles Felix joined him for a brief period before returning to Sardinia the following year with his wife. He formally retained the role of Viceroy until 1821, although he returned to the court in Turin after a short period.\n\n== Revolution of 1821 ==\n=== Origin ===\nFollowing revolts in [[Cadiz]] in 1820, King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] was forced to restore the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and hope of obtaining similar concessions from their own sovereigns arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo.\n\nThe initial indications of crisis were confirmed on 11 January 1821 when four students were stopped by the police at a theatre performance in Turin because they were wearing red caps with black bows, symbol of the carboneria. The young men offered resistance and were arrested, provoking a large brawl.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 300}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, all the students and many of their teachers protested, calling for the release of the youths and, when this was refused, they blockaded themselves in the university and the government was forced to call in the army. Although nobody was killed, the wounded were very numerous and the situation escalated.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 301}}</ref>\n\nA connection was made between the protestors and the secret society of the \"Federati\", whose leaders [[Annibale Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Count of Santarosa|Santorre di Rossi]], [[Giacinto Collegno]], Carlo Emanuele Asinari, and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi (all soldiers, officials, or sons of ministers) and [[Roberto d'Azeglio]] met with Charles Albert on the 6th of March. They were ready to act, having identified the prince as a new man for the House of Savoy, who might be willing to break with the absolutist past.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|p. 63}}</ref>\n\nThe goal of the conspirators was not to abolish the House of Savoy, but to induce it to enact political and social reforms and then undertake a war against Austria, which seemed possible in light of the deeply anti-Austrian sentiments of the Victor Emmanuel I.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 302}}</ref>\n\nIn this, the conspirators took advantage of the absence of Charles Felix, whom they thought would have been able to induce Victor Emmanuel to oppose their plans. They planned to raise the army, surround the royal residence at Moncalieri castle and force him to grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. The role of Charles Albert would have been to mediate between the conspirators and the king,<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 65, 76}}</ref> but the following morning, he changed his mind and attempted to escape from the conspirators, although he did not disavow them.\n\n=== Beginning of the revolt ===\nThe conspirators grew suspicious and prepared to cancel the insurrection which they had planned for the 10th. The same day, Charles Albert, completely penitent, raced to Moncalieri in order to confess everything to Victor Emmanuel and beg for pardon. In the night the garrison of [[Alessandria]], commanded by one of the conspirators, Guglielmo Ansaldi, rebelled and occupied the city. Although they had been abandoned by the Prince, the rest of the revolutionaries decided to act at this point.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 75-79}}</ref>\n\n=== Abdication of Victor Emmanuel and regency of Charles Albert ===\n[[File:Bernero - Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Victor Emmanuel I]], who abdicated in favour of Charles Felix after the rebellion of 1821]]\nOn Sunday 11 March 1821, King Victor Emmanuel I met with the Crown Council, which Charles Albert was a member of. As a result of the king's indecision, no action was taken.\n\nOn 12 March, the [[Citadel of Turin]] fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel encouraged Charles Albert and [[Cesare Balbo]] to negotiate with the Carbonari, who refused to listen to their messages. Thus, in the evening, in the face of the spreading military uprising, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in [[Modena]] at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 85-89, 98}}</ref>\n\nThe abdication of the king, which followed the dismissal of the ministers of state, led to chaos because it created a dynastic crisis which foreign powers would not ignore and because it split the army and bureaucracy, preventing every possibility of maintaining order.\n\nThe regent tried to take control by naming a new government (the lawyer, Ferdinando del Pozzo (1768-1843) as Minister of the Intrior, general Emanuele Pes di Villamarina as minister of war, and Lodovico Sauli d'Igliano as minister of foreign affairs) and attempted to negotiate with the rebels, but he achieved nothing.\n\nGiven the impossibility of taking any decisions without the agreement of the new king, Charles Albert sent Charles Felix an account of the events, seeking instructions, but the letter took a very long time to reach its destination.\n\nFearful of becoming the object of popular anger, on the evening of 13 March 1821, Charles Albert signed a decree granting a constitution along the lines of the Spanish constitution of 1812, which would not become law until approved by the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 91-95}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, the regent decided to form a junta, which was to protect the parliament. Two days after that, he swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, in a Savoyard version which had been slightly altered according to the requests of Victor Emmanuel's consort, [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, Queen of Sardinia|Maria Therese]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|pp. 95-96}}</ref>\n\n===Intervention of Charles Felix ===\nAt this point, Charles Felix, who had now received the letter from Charles Albert notifying him of his brother's abdication, decided to act. He told the messenger not to address him as \"majesty\", then asserted that since the abdication had been extracted through violence, it could not be considered valid. Finally, he said, \"tell the Prince that, if there is still a drop of our royal blood in his veins, he should set out for Novara immediately and wait there for my orders.\"\n\nAs for the Spanish constitution, he declared any sovereign acts taken after the abdication of his brother to be null and void, then he issued the following proclamation, \"Far from consenting to any change in the pre-existing form of government with the nominal abdication of the king, our beloved brother, we consider all the royal subjects who have aided or abetted the traitors or who have presumed to proclaim a constitution, to be rebels.\"\n\nCharles Albert, deeply discouraged, did as Charles Felix commanded, went to Novara, and issued a proclamation renouncing the regency and calling on everyone to submit to Charles Felix. On the 29th, he received a letter from Charles Felix ordering him to depart with his family for Florence.\n\nWith Charles Albert out of the way, Charles Felix dispatched several letters to [[Francis I of Austria]], asking him to send troops in order to suppress the revolt.\n\nOn 3 April, he issued a second proclamation which granted a pardon to the soldiers while applying strict sanctions to rebel officials, which ultimately, prevented any form of compromise. Chancellor [[Metternich]] himself said to [[Francis IV of Modena]] that this proclamation had been imprudent and was written \"with animosity, passion, and hatred.\"\n\nThe rebels, realising that no other option remained for them, marched on Novara, where the forces loyal to Charles Felix were gathered under the command of [[Vittorio Sallier de La Tour]]. This, inevitably, convinced Metternich to intervene.\n\nOn 8 April there was a battle with (Noara-Borgo Vercelli) with the troops of de La Tour and then with those of the Austrian general Ferdinand von Bubna, who occupied Vercelli and Alessandria on 11 April, while de La Tour, who had received full powers from Charles Felix, occupied Turin on the 10th.\n\nOn 19 April, despite pressure from the emperors of Russia and Austria, Metternich, Charles Albert, Francis IV, and Charles Felix himself (who hated the idea of receiving the crown \"thanks\" to rebels), Victor Emmanuel reaffirmed his abdication. Thus, on 25 April, Charles Felix acceded to the throne.\n\n===Suppression===\nOnce control of Turin was re-established, Charles Felix, who was still in Modena, entered into personal communication with the Emperor of Austria in order to obtain recognition from the [[Congress of Laibach]], which was then in session, that he would be able to assume full control of his possessions, as an absolute monarch, and that Austria would not be allowed to interfere in any way in his territories.\n\nAt the subsequent [[Congress of Verona]], Charles Felix feared pressure for constitutional changes and reiterated in his instructions to his ambassadors that the repression of the \"revolutionary spirit\" inspired by the Congress of Laibach belonged exclusively to him and that he was firmly convinced of the necessity of this obligation.\n\nHaving decided to remain at Modena, he appointed [[Ignazio Thaon di Revel]] as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, and placed G. Piccono della Valle and G.C. Brignole in charge of foreign affairs and financial affairs respectively.\n\nFinally, he began the suppression of opposition. The following extract from the work of [[Guido Astuti]] describes his actions:\n{{quotation|The new king, Charles Felix, let loose a reaction with arbitrary repressive methods, using extraordinary commissions to judge the rebels and establishing political investigators in order to purge the army and the bureaucracy|G. Astuti, ''Gli ordinamenti giuridici degli Stati sabaudi'', p. 544.}}\n\nFinally, the king instituted three different jurisdictions: a mixed civil and military tribunal called the Royal Delegation with penal powers, a military commission for investigating the conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers, and a scrutiny commission for investigating the conduct of every employee of the kingdom.\n\nThe Royal Delegation sat from 7 May to early October, in which time it issued 71 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and 20 sentences of imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. After the delegation's dissolution, the senate issued a further 24 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and another 12 sentences of imprisonment for 15\u201320 years. By the end of October the military commission had dismissed 627 officers.<ref name= \"Testedistoria\" />\n\nThe scrutiny commission, divided into a superior tribunal and seven divisional boards of scrutiny, issued numerous dismissals and suspensions of cvil servants and professors of every kind of school, whom it found particularly culpable.<ref name= \"Testedistoria\" />\n\nOn the instructions of the minister of the interior, Roget de Cholex, the University of Turin was closed and many professors received severe admonitions because, as the king wrote in a letter to his brother (9 May 1822): \"everyone who has studied at the university is entirely corrupt: the professors are detestable, but there is no way to replace them... Thus the bad are all taught and the good are all ignorant.\".<ref>Corrado Vivanti, Et\u00e0 Contemporanea, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn any case, although an oppressive climate was established,<ref>{{harvnb|Perrero|pp. 288\u2013293}}</ref> accompanied by the habituation to accusations and to the diversity of political ideas, offering a pretext for pursuing private vendettas,<ref>Rosario Romeo, ''Dal Piemonte sabaudo all'Italia liberale''. Torino, Einaudi, 1963, p.33</ref> the royal authority, especially the governor of Genoa, [[Giorgio Des Geneys]], did not prevent people from fleeing. Of all the people who were condemned, only two were actually executed.<ref name=\"Cita|Montanelli|p. 344\">{{harvb|Montanelli|p. 344}}</ref>\n\nFurther, it is reported by a letter of the Count d'Agli\u00e8 that Charles Felix never prevented anyone from secretly passing subsidies to condemned men who had gone into exile and [[Angelo Brofferio]] reports that when the king discovered that one of these subsidies was going to the family of one of the two individuals who had actually been executed in 1821, the king doubled the sum.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 351}}</ref>\n\nThe suppression of opposition was terminated on 30 September 1821, when Charles Felix issued a pardon of all individuals who had been implicated in the revolt, excluding the leaders, the financiers and those who had been found guilty of homicide or extortion. A few days later, Charles Felix entered Turin.\n\n==Reign (1821-1831)==\nEven before he reached Turin, Charles Felix repudiated the Regent's promise and, to help restore order, he called in the Austrians, who stayed in Piedmont till 1823. In that same year Charles Albert went to Spain to extinguish by force of arms the last sparks of revolt, making himself an object of hatred as the betrayer of Italian liberalism, but regaining the confidence of the King, who might have chosen another successor.\n\nCharles Felix was a true reactionary, convinced that the world would soon be swept clean of all those - in his view - wicked and sacrilegious innovations introduced by the French Revolution and diffused throughout Europe by Napoleon Bonaparte \"the rascal\" as he called him.\n\n=== Internal policy ===\n[[File:Carlo Felice 1 lira genova.jpg|thumb|Charles Felix depicted on a 1 [[Sardinian lira|lira]] coin of 1828]]\nCharles Felix was rarely present at Turin as king and did not participate in the social life of the capital, since he had never sought the throne and had no particular affection for the Turinese, whom he considered to have proven themselves traitors to the dynasty through their support for Napoleon and the constitutional protests.<ref>{{harvnb|Montanelli|p. 350}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, he resided in Turin only during the theatre season<ref name=\"Cita|Montanelli|p. 344\"/> and he spent the rest of the time travelling around Savoy, Nice, Genoa (one of his favourite residences) and the castles of [[Govone Castle|Govone]] and [[Ducal castle of Agli\u00e8|Agli\u00e8]], which he had inherited from his sister Maria Anna.\n\nAs a result, the king tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior,<!--What a slime! If an autocrat refuses to delegate power to the people, the least they can do is actually exercise the power themselves...--> reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by [[Massimo d'Azeglio]] as follows:\n\n{{quotation|A despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honour, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.|Massimo d'Azeglio, citato in Montanelli, ''L'Italia Giacobina e Carbonara'', p. 344.}}\n\nNevertheless, the king was not entirely unaware of the need for reform and certainly exerted himself in the defense of the Piedmontese realm from Pontifical and foreign intervetion. He limited the privileges and exemptions of the church, which seemed harmful to the state, almost completely abolishing the right of sanctuary in holy places, granted secular courts the right to hear cases against priests, and imposed civic oversight of [[catechism]]s, sermons, and religious books.\n\nRegarding the issue of church property which had been secularised in 1792 (with Papal consent) and Francisican property which had been secularised unilaterally, the king appointed an extraordinary board composed of official and supporters of the clergy.\nThe proposals, delivered to [[Pope Leo XII]] by ambassador-extraordinary [[Filiberto Avogadro di Collobiano]] in December 1827, were examined by a council of cardinals, who rejected some financial details and the right of the state to dispose of the property freely. However, on 1 April 1828, the king summoned a new council, to which he professed flexibility on the financial issues and rigidity on the issue of disposal. The resulting agreement was approved on 14 May 1828 by the Holy See.<ref>F Lemmi, Carlo Felice, Torino, 1931, p. 221.</ref>\n\nThere were also important legislative reforms, which were effected by the Edict of 16 July 1822, which reformed mortgages; the Edict of 27 August 1822, which unified the military penal law; and the Edict of 27 September 1822, which reformed the judicial system. These changes were capped by the ''Civil and Criminal Laws of the Kingdom of Sardinia'', signed on 16 January 1827, which replaced the dated [[Carta de Logu]].\n\n{{quotation|Charles Felix, like every man of the Restoration, which simultaneously included both reactionaries and reformers, had had a great variety of experiences and appeared to oscillate between the open revival of eighteenth century despotism, which had come to an end with the Napoleonic state, and historic innovations, which had little luck in Italy, however... On the one hand there was a typical effort to update dynastic absolutism, on the other hand there was substantial adoption of the Frence system - with exceptions and modifications.|E. Genta, Eclettismo giuridico della Restaurazione, pp.357-362.}}\n\nIn fact, while Victor Emmanuel had implemented a rigid counter-revolution, which uncritically revoked every arrangement made by the French after the abdication of Charles Emmanuel IV, the state could not continue to ignore the will of the majority of its subjects who called for laws in accordance with the ideas and needs of their contemporary world. Some reforms to fill the gaps were necessary.<ref>F. Sclopis, ''Storia della legislazione italiana dall'epoca della Rivoluzione francese, 1789, a quella delle Riforme italiane, 1847'', p.206.</ref>\n\nThus, on 27 September 1822, after Charles Felix had re-established the publication of mortgages and codified the military penal law, he promulgated an Edict on the reform of the civil judicial system - excluding Sardinia.\n\nThe edict abolished a majority of the special jurisdictions (e.g. for gambling offences, or management of ports), instituted 40 collegial prefecture tribunals (which managed 416 \"district courts\"), with [[original jurisdiction]], which were divided into four classes, according to the importance of the area, and he entrusted instruction of the procedures to special members of these tribunals. Civil and penal jurisdiction remained with the Senate in Turin and fiscal jurisdiction with the [[Court of Audit (Italy)|Court of Audit]].<ref>Piola Caselli, ''La Magistratura. Studio sull'ordinamento giudiziario nella storia, nelle leggi straniere, nella legge italiana e nei progetti di riforma'', pp. 226-227.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a single [[appellate jurisdiction]] was introduced, eliminating the multiplicity of appeals that had previously existed and the ministerial position of fiscal advocate was introduced.<ref>M. Taruffo, ''La giustizia civile in Italia dal \u2018700 ad oggi'', p.94</ref>\n\nFinally, he made the act of taking a case to court free, however inadequately, replacing the old system of the ''sportula'', which was a very heavy judicial fee, calculated on the basis of the seriousness of the case, which provided the judges' pay, with a regular system of salaries paid by the state.<ref>P. Saraceno, ''Storia della magistratura italiana. Le origini \u2013 la magistratura nel Regno di Sardegna'', pp.40-41.</ref>\n\nAnother important change was the code of civil and criminal law of the Kingdom of Sardinia promulgated on 16 January 1827, mainly as a result of the work of the Count of Cholex. The code was prepared in Turin by the Supreme Council of Sardinia. It was then examined by an appropriate Sardinian committee and the [[Real Audiencia#Audiencias in Italy|Reale Udienza]] of Sardinia. The result was a confection of Sardinian and mainland sources, creating a law which was both traditional and novel.<ref>. G. Manno, ''Biografia di S. A. R. il duca del Genevese poscia re C. F., in Note sarde e ricordi'', Torino 1868, p. 288</ref>\n\nThe most novel changes relate to penal law: the abolition of the ''giudatico'' (impunity for criminals who had arrested other criminals) and the ''esemplarit\u00e0'' (cruel extensions of the death penalty, like [[hung, drawn, and quartered|quartering]] the corpse and scattering the ashes); restrictions on the imposition of the death penalty; affirmation of the principle that the punishment should fit the crime; and the distinction between attempted crimes and crimes actually committed.<ref>C. Sole,''La Sardegna di Carlo Felice e il problema della terra'', Cagliari 1967 p.65</ref>\n\nFinally, the slave trade was abolished and it was declared that any person who was found in captivity on a ship flying the Sardinian flag would instantly be freed.<ref>A. Imeroni, ''I re di Sardegna pel riscatto degli schiavi dai Barbareschi'', in Rass. stor. d. Risorg., XXII (1935), pp. 580-588.</ref>\n\n=== Economic initiatives ===\n[[File:Genoa (25).jpg|thumb|250px|The Teatro Carlo Felice, Genoa]]\nCharles Felix's reign was characterised by financial and economic difficulties and rigid protectionism, but there were some initiatives relating to services and public works.\n\nThe road network was improved by the construction of the road between [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]] (now [[Strada statale 131 Charles Felix]]) and between Genoa and Nice, as well as bridges over the [[Bormida (river)|Bormida]] and the [[Ticino]] (the latter completed in 1828). A large number of public buildings were constructed in the cities: the port of Nice was largely restored, Genoa received a theatre (the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], named after the king), and Turin benefited from a programme of urban improvement which included the bridge over the [[Dora Riparia|Dora]], the [[Piazza Carlo Felice]], underground drainage channels, the porticos of the [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]] and various new suburbs.\n\nCharles Felix paid attention to the steelworking sector, which had already occupied him as Viceroy, as well as the banking and insurance sectors, which were improved significantly by the creation of the [[Cassa di Risparmio di Torino]] in 1827 and the establishment of the [[Reale Mutua Assicurazioni|Royal Mutual Society of Insurers]] in June 1829. He also encouraged the agricultural and manufacturing sector by granting lots of exemptions and fiscal benefits and through the creation of [[trade fair]]s like that of 1829, in which 500 exhibitors participated.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n{{see also|Battle of Tripoli (1825)}}\nTheoretically, Charles Felix was committed to the territorial expansion of his realm, but he did not maintain any expansionist illusions and preferred to concentrate on the economic and commercial interests of his realm.<ref>F. Lemmi, ''La politica estera di Carlo Alberto nei suoi primi anni di regno'', Firenze 1928, p. 93.</ref><ref>Bianchi, Storia della Diplomazia, II, p.77.</ref> Thus in 1821, with the help of the Austrians and English, he signed an advantageous trade agreement with the [[Sublime Porte]].\n\nIn September 1825, in order to force the [[Bey of Tripoli]] to observe the treaty established with him in 1816 under English auspices, and to respect Sardinian ships sailing along the coast of North Africa, he launched a demonstration of force. Towards the end of the month, two frigates (''Commercio'' and ''Cristina''), a corvette (''Tritone'') and a brig (''Nereide'') under the command of captain [[Francesco Sivori]], appeared off the coast of Tripoli. After a final attempt to pressure the Bey diplomatically, ten Sardinian longboats sailed into the harbour on the night of 27 September and set fire to a Tripolitanian brig and two schooners, routing or murdering the Tripolitanian troops. This forced the Bey to take a more conciliatory approach.<ref>Account from Am. Des Geneys, ''Arch. di Stato di Torino''</ref>\n\nIn 1828, he ended the construction of a bridge over the River Ticino at [[Boffalora sopra Ticino|Boffalora]], which had been begun by his brother Victor Emmanuel I some years earlier as a result of a treaty with the Emperor of Austria, who controlled the other side of the river as part of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia]].\n\n=== Patronage ===\n[[File:Carlo Felice Savoy Sardinia Hautecombe.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles Felix, [[Hautecombe Abbey]]]]\nCharles Felix was an avid patron of art and culture. In 1824, he acquired [[Hautecombe Abbey]], where many of his ancestors were buried and entrusted a restoration programme to the architect [[Ernesto Melano]].\n\nIn the same year, he was responsible for the acquisition of a good part of the collection which now constitutes the [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin. The pieces were acquired from [[Bernardino Drovetti]], a native of [[Barbania]], who was then the French [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Egypt. The collection was placed in the [[Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze (Turin)|Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze]], which is still the site of the museum.\n\nIn 1827, Charles Felix instituted the chamber of commerce and the School of Palaeography and Diplomacy, affiliated to the academy of painting and sculpture.\n\n==Death and succession==\nCharles Felix died without issue on 27 April 1831, in Turin at the [[Palazzo Chablais]] which had been given to him by his sister [[Princess Maria Anna of Savoy|Princess Maria Anna, Duchess of Chablais]], after a reign of ten years. He was buried at Hautecombe Abbey in Savoy, where his wife was also buried in 1849. With his death, the main line of the [[House of Savoy]] became extinct. He was succeeded by the senior male member of the House of Savoy-Carignano, the regent [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]] (1798-1849). The selection of Charles Albert as successor had not been made willingly, since Charles Albert had shown himself to be inclined to liberalism and friendly to the carbonari.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]] is named for him.\n\nThe principal road of the island of [[Sardinia]], the [[Strada statale 131 Charles Felix]], which connects the towns of [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]]-[[Porto Torres]], constructed in the 19th century, is named for him.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA26|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=26}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.  The Polish CBeebies channel was launched in December 2007, while feeds in [[Latin America]], Asia, South Africa and Australia were launched in 2008.\nIn March 2011, the [[Video on demand|on demand]] version of the network was launched in the US and is available on [[Xfinity|Xfinity]].\n\nOn 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel [[BBC Kids]] in Canada, available on weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]]. CBeebies Asia has already launched in Hong Kong, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} On 13 April 2017, the localised CBeebies feed for Latin America ceased transmissions along with [[BBC Earth]] and BBC Entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn 5 April 2018, a feed was launched on [[Digiturk]] in Turkey.\n\nIn September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2 hour children's block on BBC Alba was split into CBeebies Alba and [[CBBC (TV channel)#CBBC_Alba|CBBC Alba]], with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n* [[Rebecca Keatley]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[Ben Cajee]] (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]]'', ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).

They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]]'', ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).

Born in [[Schilpario]] in the [[Republic of Venice]], Grassi studied in [[Bergamo]] and [[Colorno]], where he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. Because the Society was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed by the pope]], he completed his education at the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]], as the Jesuits were allowed to operate in the [[Russian Empire]]. He proved to be an excellent student of the [[natural science]]s, especially [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]], in which he would later engage in research, and was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college's [[Institute for Nobles]].\n\nIn 1805, the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] directed Grassi to go to [[Beijing|Peking]] to replace the last remaining [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary in China]]. This set off for Grassi and two other Jesuits a journey across Europe that would last five years, during which they spent time in London and [[Lisbon]], but never reached China. Grassi ended up teaching and studying at the [[University of Coimbra]], before being transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in England, where he taught for several years and also studied at the [[Royal Institution]].\n\nGrassi was then sent by the General in 1810 to the United States, where he was to teach at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was eventually appointed superior of the [[Jesuits in the United States|Jesuits' Maryland Mission]] and [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president of the College]] in 1812, where he significantly improved its curriculum, enrollment, and public reputation. Grassi also obtained its [[congressional charter]], which officially recognized the institution as a university. His tenure came to an end in 1817, when Archbishop [[Leonard Neale]] sent him as his representative to the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]]''.\n\nGrassi never returned to the United States. Rather, he moved to [[Turin]], becoming the rector of the [[Social Institute, Turin|College of Nobles]] for ten years. He also became a close confidant to the monarchs of the [[House of Savoy]], as well as [[provincial superior]] of the Jesuits' Turin Province. In 1835, he was transferred to Rome, where he became rector of the [[Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide|Pontifico Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide]] and later the Superior General's assistant for Italy.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nGiovanni Antonio Grassi was born on 10 September 1775 in [[Schilpario]], [[Lombardy]], in the [[Republic of Venice]]. He studied under the [[Somaschi Fathers]], before going to the diocesan [[seminary]] of [[Bergamo]], where he studied [[Catholic theology|theology]] for two years and was ordained a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]]. Grassi then entered the [[Society of Jesus]], which at the time was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|officially suppressed]] by the [[pope]].<ref name=\"schlafly354\">{{harvnb|Schlafly|2015|p=354}}</ref> He proceeded to the Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[Colorno]], on 21 November 1799,<ref name=garraghan273>{{harvnb|Garraghan|1937|p=273}}</ref> becoming one of the novitiate's first students.<ref name=\"schlafly354\" />\n\n[[File:Po\u0142acak, Jezuicki. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043a, \u0415\u0437\u0443\u0456\u0446\u043a\u0456 (1800) (2).jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]] in 1800|alt=Entrance of the Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]]\n\nDue to the nearly worldwide suppression of the Jesuit order, the novices at Colorno were allowed only to pronounce their [[simple vows]].

Born in [[Schilpario]] in the [[Republic of Venice]], Grassi studied in [[Bergamo]] and [[Colorno]], where he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. Because the Society was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed by the pope]], he completed his education at the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]], as the Jesuits were allowed to operate in the [[Russian Empire]]. He proved to be an excellent student of the [[natural science]]s, especially [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]], in which he would later engage in research, and was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college's [[Institute for Nobles]].\n\nIn 1805, the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] directed Grassi to go to [[Beijing|Peking]] to replace the last remaining [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary in China]]. This set off for Grassi and two other Jesuits a journey across Europe that would last five years, during which they spent time in London and [[Lisbon]], but never reached China. Grassi ended up teaching and studying at the [[University of Coimbra]], before being transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in England, where he taught for several years and also studied at the [[Royal Institution]].\n\nGrassi was then sent by the General in 1810 to the United States, where he was to teach at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was eventually appointed superior of the [[Jesuits in the United States|Jesuits' Maryland Mission]] and [[List of presidents of Georgetown University|president of the College]] in 1812, where he significantly improved its curriculum, enrollment, and public reputation. Grassi also obtained its [[congressional charter]], which officially recognized the institution as a university. His tenure came to an end in 1817, when Archbishop [[Leonard Neale]] sent him as his representative to the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda Fide]]''.\n\nGrassi never returned to the United States. Rather, he moved to [[Turin]], becoming the rector of the [[Social Institute, Turin|College of Nobles]] for ten years. He also became a close confidant to the monarchs of the [[House of Savoy]], as well as [[provincial superior]] of the Jesuits' Turin Province. In 1835, he was transferred to Rome, where he became rector of the [[Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide|Pontifico Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide]] and later the Superior General's assistant for Italy.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nGiovanni Antonio Grassi was born on 10 September 1775 in [[Schilpario]], [[Lombardy]], in the [[Republic of Venice]]. He studied under the [[Somaschi Fathers]], before going to the diocesan [[seminary]] of [[Bergamo]], where he studied [[Catholic theology|theology]] for two years and was ordained a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]]. Grassi then entered the [[Society of Jesus]], which at the time was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|officially suppressed]] by the [[pope]].<ref name=\"schlafly354\">{{harvnb|Schlafly|2015|p=354}}</ref> He proceeded to the Jesuit [[novitiate]] in [[Colorno]], on 21 November 1799,<ref name=garraghan273>{{harvnb|Garraghan|1937|p=273}}</ref> becoming one of the novitiate's first students.<ref name=\"schlafly354\" />\n\n[[File:Po\u0142acak, Jezuicki. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043a, \u0415\u0437\u0443\u0456\u0446\u043a\u0456 (1800) (2).jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]] in 1800|alt=Entrance of the Jesuit College in Po\u0142ock]]\n\nDue to the nearly worldwide suppression of the Jesuit order, the novices at Colorno were allowed only to pronounce their [[simple vows]].

On their arrival, however, they discovered that no ships would take them to Peking. With the help of the English Jesuits, they obtained the intervention of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord George Macartney]], the former British ambassador to China, who unsuccessfully attempted to convince the [[List of East India Company directors|directors]] of the [[East India Company]] to allow the Jesuits to travel on their vessels.<ref name=\"voyage122\">{{harvnb|Voyage of Very Rev.

{"title_page": "Rights of nature", "text_new": "{{Environmental law}}\n\n'''Rights of nature''' is a legal and jurisprudential theory that describes inherent rights as associated with ecosystems and species, similar to the concept of fundamental human rights. The rights of nature concept challenges 20th century laws as generally grounded in a flawed frame of nature as \u201cresource,\u201d to be owned, used, and degraded. Proponents argue that laws grounded in nature\u2019s rights better direct humanity to act in a way consistent with modern, system-based science, which demonstrates that humans and the natural world are fundamentally interconnected. \u00a0\n\nThis school of thought is underpinned by two basic lines of reasoning. First, since the recognition of human rights is in part based on the philosophical belief that those rights emanate from humanity's own existence, so too logically do inherent rights of the natural world arise from the natural world\u2019s own existence. A second and more pragmatic argument asserts that humans' own survival depends on healthy ecosystems, and so protection of nature\u2019s rights in turn advances human rights and well-being.\n\nFrom a rights of nature perspective, most environmental laws of the 20th century are based on an outmoded framework that considers nature as comprised of separate and independent parts, rather than components of a larger whole. A more significant criticism is that those laws tend to be subordinate to economic interests, and aim at reacting to and just partially mitigating economics-driven degradation, rather than placing nature's right to thrive as their primary goal.\n\nThe rights of nature legal theory and the ethics buttressing it share common grounding with a wide range of philosophical and spiritual traditions that recognize a deep connection and belonging between humans\nand nature, and a responsibility of humans to preserve, and be a respectful part of, the natural order. These include indigenous worldviews; Asian traditions such as [[Daoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], and [[Hinduism]]; and principles derived from [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islamic]] traditions. \n\nProponents of the rights of nature also contend that societies have continued to expand rights as acceptance of the inherent moral worth of the potential new rights holders grows, and that this expansion of the circle of community should grow to encompass the natural world.\n\nAs of 2019 nature\u2019s rights laws exist at the local to national levels in 12 countries, including dozens of cities and counties across the United States, in the form of constitutional provisions, treaty agreements, statutes, local ordinances, and court decisions. \n\n==Basic tenets==\nProponents of rights of nature argue that, just as [[human rights]] have been increasingly recognized in  law, so should nature's rights be recognized and incorporated into human ethics and laws. This claim is underpinned by two lines of reasoning: that the same ethics that justify human rights also justify nature's rights, and, that humans' own survival depend on healthy ecosystems.<ref name=\"Cullinan 2011\"/><ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/><ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/><ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nFirst, it is argued that if inherent human rights arise from human existence, so too logically do inherent rights of the natural world arise from the natural world\u2019s own existence.<ref name=\"Sheehan 2013\"/> Human rights, and associated duties to protect those rights, have expanded over time.<ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/> Most notably, the United Nations' 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) formalized recognition of broad categories of inalienable human rights. Drafters of the UDHR stated their belief that the concept of fundamental [[human rights]] arose not from \u201cthe decision of a worldly power, but rather in the fact of existing.\u201d<ref name=\"UN/Santa Cruz 1948\"/>\n\n[[File:Thomas Berry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Berry]], was a U.S. cultural historian who introduced the legal concept of [[Earth jurisprudence|Earth Jurisprudence]]. He proposed that society\u2019s laws should derive from the laws of nature, explaining that \u201cthe universe is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 2006\"/><ref name=\"Bell 2003\"/><ref name=\"Burdon 2012\"/>]]\n\nSome scholars have therefore contended that given that basic human rights emanate from humans' own existence, nature\u2019s rights similarly arise from the existence of nature itself, and so humans' legal systems should continue to expand to recognize the rights of nature.<ref name=\"Cullinan 2011\"/><ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/><ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/><ref name=\"Shiva 2011\"/> Some notable proponents of this approach include U.S. cultural historian [[Thomas Berry]], South African attorney [[Cormac Cullinan]], Indian physicist and eco-social advocate [[Vandana Shiva]], and Canadian law professor and U.N.

This school of thought aims at following the same path that human rights movements have followed, where at first recognition of rights in the rightless appeared \u201cunthinkable,\u201d but later matured into a broadly-espoused worldview.<ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/>\n\nLaw professor at the University of Southern California Christopher Stone wrote extensively on this topic in his seminal essay \u201cShould Trees Have Standing,\u201d cited by a U.S. Supreme Court dissent in ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' for the position that \u201cenvironmental issues should be tendered by [nature] itself.\u201d{{efn|name=fn1|The ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' case was decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1972. In it, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote a dissenting opinion.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/><ref name=\"SCOTUS Justice Douglas' dissent 1972\"/> His opinion highlighted the rights of nature, and the intellectual contributions of Christopher Stone and [[Aldo Leopold]]:<br/>\"(...)Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. See Stone, ''Should Trees Have Standing? -- Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects'', 45 S.Cal.L.Rev. 450 (1972).(...).<br/>Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes. The corporation sole -- a creature of ecclesiastical law -- is an acceptable adversary, and large fortunes ride on its cases. The ordinary corporation is a \"person\" for purposes of the adjudicatory processes, whether it represents proprietary, spiritual, aesthetic, or charitable causes.<br/> So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes -- fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life.

For example, the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] prioritizes protection of existing economic interests by activating only when species populations are headed toward extinction.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/> By contrast, a \u201cHealthy Species Act\u201d would prioritize achievement of thriving species populations, and facilitate economic systems that drive species conservation.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/>\n\nAs another example, the European Union's [[Water Framework Directive|Water Framework Directive]] of 2000, \u201cwidely accepted as the most substantial and ambitious piece of European environmental legislation to date,\u201d<ref name=\"Voulvoulis 2017\"/> relies on a target of \u201cgood status\u201d of all EU waters, which includes consideration of needed \u201cecological flows.\u201d<ref name=\"Ramos 2017\"/> However, decades after the Directive\u2019s adoption, there remains no EU definition of \u201cecological flow,\u201d nor a common understanding of how it should be calculated, despite scientific advances in identifying flow-ecology relationships.<ref name=\"Voulvoulis 2017\"/><ref name=\"Ramos 2017\"/> A nature\u2019s rights frame would recognize not only the existing [[Human right to water and sanitation|human right to water]] for basic needs, but would also recognize waterways\u2019 own rights to adequate, timely, clean water flows, and would define such basic ecological flow needs accordingly.<ref name=\"Sivas 2017\"/>\n\n===Underlying science and ethics===\nModern environmental laws began to arise in the 1960s out of a foundational perspective of the environment as best managed in discrete pieces.<ref name=\"Udall 1988\"/> For example, United States laws such as the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and numerous others began to be adopted in the early 1970s to address various elements of the natural world separately from other elements. Some laws, such as the U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]], called for a more holistic analysis of proposed infrastructure projects, and required the disclosure of expected negative environmental impacts. However, it did not require that actions be taken to address those impacts to ensure ecosystem and species health.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/>\n\nThese laws reflected the science of the time, which was grounded in a [[Reductionism|reductionist]] analysis of the natural world; the modern, system-based understanding of the natural world, and humans\u2019 integrated place with it, was still in development.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/> The first major textbook on ecological science, which described the natural world as a system rather than a collection of different parts, was not written until 1983.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/><ref name=\"Odum 1983\"/> The [[Gaia Hypothesis]], which offered a scientific vision of the world as a self-regulating, complex system, first arose in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Jabr 2019\"/> [[System dynamics|Systems dynamics]] similarly began to evolve from a business focus to include socioeconomic and natural systems starting in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Meadows et al. 1972\"/> Since then scientific disciplines have been converging and advancing on the concept that humans live in a dynamic, relationship-based world that \u201cden[ies] the possibility of isolation.\u201d<ref name=\"Tribe 1974\"/><ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/>\n\nWhile science in the late 20th century shifted to a systems-based perspective, describing natural systems and human populations as fundamentally interconnected on a shared planet,<ref name=\"Thiele 2011\"/> environmental laws generally did not evolve with this shift. Reductionist U.S. environmental laws passed in the early 1970s remained largely unchanged, and other national and international environmental law regimes similarly stopped short of embracing the modern science of systems.<ref name=\"Cullinan 2011\"/>\n\nNineteenth century linguist and scholar [[Edward Payson Evans]], an early rights of nature theorist and author of \"the first extensive American statement of (...) environmental ethics,\u201d<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/> wrote that each human is \u201ctruly a part and product of Nature as any other animal, and [the] attempt to set him up on an isolated point outside of it is philosophically false and morally pernicious.\u201d<ref name=\"Evans 1897\"/><ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\n[[Thomas Berry]] proposed that society\u2019s laws should derive from the laws of nature, explaining that \u201cthe universe is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 2006\"/> From the scientific perspective that all life arose from the context of the universe, Berry offered the ethical perspective that it is flawed to view humans as the universe\u2019s only subjects, with all other beings merely a collection of objects to be owned and used. Rather, consideration of life as a web of relationships extending back to a shared ancestry confers subject status to all, including the inherent rights associated with that status.

Indigenous law professor [[John Borrows]] observed that \u201c[w]ithin indigenous legal traditions, creation stories... give guidance about how to live with the world,\u201d rather than live at odds with it.<ref name=\"Borrows 2010\"/> A 2012 international Declaration of Indigenous Peoples found that modern laws destroy the earth because they do not respect the \u201cnatural order of Creation.\u201d<ref name=\"Kari-Oca 2 Declaration 2012\"/> The Declaration observed that humans \u201chave our place and our responsibilities within Creation\u2019s sacred order\u201d<ref name=\"Kari-Oca 2 Declaration 2012\"/> and benefit from \u201csustaining joy as things occur in harmony with the Earth and with all life that it creates and sustains.\u201d<ref name=\"Kari-Oca 2 Declaration 2012\"/>\n\nIndigenous worldviews align with and have accelerated the development of rights of nature law, including in Ecuador and Bolivia.<ref name=\"Herold 2017\"/><ref name=\"Lake 2010\"/><ref name=\"Studley 2018\"/> Ecuador amended its [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|constitution]] in 2008 to recognize the rights of nature in light of the perceived need to better protect and respect [[Pachamama]], a term that embodies both the physical and the spiritual aspects of the natural world.<ref name=\"UNGA A/71/266 2016\"/> Bolivia similarly amended its [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]] and enacted nature\u2019s rights statutes to reflect traditional indigenous respect for Pachamama, and a worldview of natural systems and humans as part of one family.<ref name=\"Vidal 2011\"/>\n\nNew Zealand law professor Catherine Iorns Magallanes observed that traditional indigenous worldviews embody a connection with nature are so deep that nature is regarded as a living ancestor. From this worldview arises responsibilities to protect nature as one would a family member, and the need for a legal structure that reflects a primary frame of responsibilities to the natural world as kin.<ref name=\"Magallanes & Sheehan 2017\"/>\n\n===Common roots with world religions===\nMany of the world\u2019s other religious and spiritual traditions offer insights consistent with a nature\u2019s rights worldview.<ref name=\"Grim & Tucker 2014\"/> Eastern religious and philosophical traditions embrace a holistic conception of spirituality that includes the earth. Chinese [[Daoism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]], as well as Japanese [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]], teach that the world is a dynamic force field of energies known as [[Bussh\u014d (Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d)|bussho]] ([[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]] or [[Qi|qi]]), the material force that flows through humans, nature, and universe. As 11th century pioneering [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] philosopher [[Zhang Zai]] explained, \u201cthat which extends throughout the universe I regard as my body and that which directs the universe I consider as my nature.\u201d<ref name=\"Tucker 1991\"/>\n\nIn both [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism, [[karma]] (\u201caction\u201d or \u201cdeclaration\u201d in [[Sanskrit]]) reflects the reality of humanity\u2019s networked interrelations with Earth and universe.<ref name=\"Thiele 2011\"/> Buddhist concepts of \u201cco-dependent arising\u201d similarly hold that all phenomena are intimately connected. [[Mahayana]] Buddhism\u2019s \u201c[[Indra's Net]]\u201d symbolizes a universe of infinitely repeated mutual relations, with no one thing dominating.<ref name=\"Macy 1991\"/><ref name=\"Thiele 2011\"/>\n\nWestern religious and philosophical traditions as well have recognized the context of Earth and universe in providing spiritual guidance. From the Neolithic through the Bronze ages, the societies of \u201c[[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]]\u201d revered numerous female deities as incarnations of Mother Earth.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/> In early Greece, the earth Goddess [[Gaia|Gaia]] was worshipped as a supreme deity.<ref name=\"Spretnak 1981\"/> In the [[Philebus]] and [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Plato]] asserted that the \u201cworld is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence (...) a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.\u201d<ref name=\"Harding 2006\"/><ref name=\"Plato -Timaeus\"/> Medieval theologian [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] later wrote of the place of humans not at the center of being, but as one part of an integrated whole with the universe as primary, stating that the \u201cThe order of the universe is the ultimate and noblest perfection in things.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/><ref name=\"Thomas Aquinas\"/>\n\nMore recently, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], head of the [[Catholic church]], reflected that, \u201c[t]he obedience to the voice of Earth is more important for our future happiness...than the desires of the moment. Our Earth is talking to us and we must listen to it and decipher its message if we want to survive.\u201d<ref name=\"Catholic News Agency 2007\"/> His successor [[Pope Francis]] has been particularly vocal on humanity\u2019s relationship with the Earth, describing how humans must change their current actions in light of the fact that \u201ca true 'right of the environment' does exist.\"<ref name=\"Goldenberg & Kirchgaessner 2015\"/> He warned against humanity\u2019s current path, stating that \u201cthe deepest roots of our present failures\u201d lie in the direction and meaning of economic growth and the overarching rule of a \u201cdeified market.\"<ref name=\"Boori 2015\"/><ref name=\"Vidal 2014\"/><ref name=\"Pope Francis 2014\"/><ref name=\"Pope Francis 2015\"/><ref name=\"Yardley & Goodstein 2015\"/>\n\nThe [[Qur\u2019an]], Islam\u2019s primary authority in all matters of individual and communal life, further reflects that \u201cthe whole creation praises God by its very being.\u201d<ref name=\"Denny 1998\"/> Scholars describe the \u201cultimate purpose of the [[Sharia|Shari'ah]]\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/> as \u201dthe universal common good, the welfare of the entire creation,\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/> and note that \u201cnot a single creature, present or future, may be excluded from consideration in deciding a course of action.\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/>\n\nBringing together Western and indigenous traditions, Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] spoke of \u201c[[Ubuntu philosophy|Ubuntu]],\u201d an African ethical concept that translates roughly to \u201cI am because you are,\u201d observing that: \"Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation.

Key to the development of those rights are the concepts of natural rights, and rights of humans emanating from the existence itself of humanity.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nRoderick Fraser Nash, professor of history and environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, traced the history of rights for species and the natural world back to the 13th century [[Magna Carta]]\u2019s launch of the concept of \u201c[[natural rights]],\u201d which underlies modern rights discourse.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nPeter Burdon, professor at the University of Adelaide Law School and an Earth Jurisprudence scholar, expanded upon Nash\u2019s analysis, offering that 17th century English philosopher and physician [[John Locke]]\u2019s transformative natural rights thesis led to the [[American Revolution]], through the concept that the British monarchy was denying colonists their natural rights.<ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/> Building on that concept, U.S. President, lawyer, and philosopher [[Thomas Jefferson]] argued that the \u201claws of nature and of nature\u2019s God\u201d reveal \u201cself-evident\u201d truths that \u201call men are created equal\u201d in their possession of \u201ccertain unalienable rights,\u201d particularly \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d The 1789 French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] later recognized as well the \u201cnatural, inalienable and sacred rights of man,\u201d adding that the \u201cfinal end of every political institution is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.\u201d<ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nThe expansion of rights continued out to animals, with 18-19th century English philosopher and legal theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] claiming that the \u201cday may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.\u201d<ref name=\"Bentham 1789\"/><ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/> Nineteenth century linguist and scholar [[Edward Payson Evans]] observed that:<ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\n:\"[i]n tracing the history of the evolution of ethics we find the recognition of mutual rights and duties confined at first to members of the same horde or tribe, then extended to worshippers of the same gods, and gradually enlarged so as to include every civilized nation, until at length all races of men are at least theoretically conceived as being united in a common bond of brotherhood and benevolent sympathy, which is now slowly expanding so as to comprise not only the higher species of animals, but also every sensitive embodiment of organic life.\"<ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) in 1948 was another milestone, underpinned by the belief that fundamental human rights arise from \u201cthe fact of existing.\u201d<ref name=\"UN/Santa Cruz 1948\"/><ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/> The movement for rights of nature built on this belief, arguing that if \u201cexistence\u201d is the defining condition for fundamental rights, this defining condition could not be limited to the rights of only one form of existence, and that all forms of existence should enjoy fundamental rights.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/> For example, [[Aldo Leopold]]\u2019s land ethic explicitly recognized nature\u2019s \u201cright to continued existence\u201d<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/> and sought to \u201cchange the role of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it.\u201d<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/>\n\nProponents of the rights of nature also contend that from the [[abolition of slavery]], to the granting to [[Women's suffrage|women of the right to vote]], to the [[civil rights movement]] and recognition of other fundamental rights, societies have continued to expand rights in parallel with a growing acceptance of the inherent moral worth of the potential new rights holders.<ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/><ref name=\"Houck 2017\"/> And, that this expansion of the circle of community ought to continue to grow to encompass the natural world,<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/><ref name=\"Daily Targum 2019\"/> a position that has seen growing acceptance in the late 20th century and early 21st.<ref name=\"Kauffman 2020\"/><ref name=\"Daily Targum 2019\"/><ref name=\"United Nations, Harmony with Nature - list of initiatives\"/>\n\nProponents suggest that rights derived from existence in nature do not confer human rights to all beings, but rather confer unique rights to different kinds of beings. Thomas Berry put forth the theory that rights \u201care species specific and limited\u201d; that is, \u201crivers have river rights,\u201d \u201cbirds have bird rights,\u201d and \u201chumans have human rights;\u201d The difference is \u201cqualitative, not quantitative.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 2006\"/><ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/>\n\nExtending this point, the common ethical and moral grounding of human rights and the rights of nature gives rise to the concept of \u201cco-violations\u201d of rights, defined as a \u201csituation in which governments, industries, or others violate both the rights of nature and human rights, including indigenous rights, with the same action.\u201d<ref name=\"Sheehan & Wilson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Wilson et al. 2016\"/> For example, in the Ecuadorian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], pollution from Texaco\u2019s (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) oil drilling operations from 1967 to 1992 resulted in an epidemic of birth defects, miscarriages, and an estimated 1,400 cancer deaths, and were particularly devastating to indigenous communities. These operations further caused over one million acres of deforestation and polluted local waterways with 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater and contaminants, severely damaging a formerly pristine rainforest of extraordinary biodiversity.<ref name=\"Sheehan & Wilson 2015\"/><ref name=\"BHRRC\"/> The same human actions that created such impacts violated the fundamental rights of both people and natural systems. It is argued that ethical and legal theories that recognize both sets of rights will better guide human behavior to recognize and respect humans' interconnected relationships with each other and the natural world.<ref name=\"Anthony 2017\"/> \n\nAs with the recognition of human rights, legal scholars find that recognition of the rights of nature alters the framework of human laws and practices.<ref name=\"Ssenyonjo & Baderin 2016\"/><ref name=\"Stone 1972\"/> Harvard Law professor [[Laurence Tribe]] theorized further that \u201cchoosing to accord nature a fraternal rather than an exploited role(...) might well make us different persons from the manipulators and subjugators we are in danger of becoming.\u201d<ref name=\"Tribe 1974\"/><ref name=\"Macy 1991-b\"/>\n\n===20th and 21st century developments===\n\nThe adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]] in 1948 globally formalized recognition of broad categories of inalienable human rights.

The rights of nature concept challenges 20th century laws as generally grounded in a flawed frame of nature as \u201cresource,\u201d to be owned, used, and degraded. Proponents argue that laws grounded in nature\u2019s rights better direct humanity to act in a way consistent with modern, system-based science, which demonstrates that humans and the natural world are fundamentally interconnected. \u00a0\n\nThis school of thought is underpinned by two basic lines of reasoning. First, since the recognition of human rights is in part based on the philosophical belief that those rights emanate from humanity's own existence, so too logically do inherent rights of the natural world arise from the natural world\u2019s own existence. A second and more pragmatic argument asserts that humans' own survival depends on healthy ecosystems, and so protection of nature\u2019s rights in turn advances human rights and well-being.\n\nFrom a rights of nature perspective, most environmental laws of the 20th century are based on an outmoded framework that considers nature as comprised of separate and independent parts, rather than components of a larger whole. A more significant criticism is that those laws tend to be subordinate to economic interests, and aim at reacting to and just partially mitigating economics-driven degradation, rather than placing nature's right to thrive as their primary goal.\n\nThe rights of nature legal theory and the ethics buttressing it share common grounding with a wide range of philosophical and spiritual traditions that recognize a deep connection and belonging between humans\nand nature, and a responsibility of humans to preserve, and be a respectful part of, the natural order. These include indigenous worldviews; Asian traditions such as [[Daoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], and [[Hinduism]]; and principles derived from [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islamic]] traditions. \n\nProponents of the rights of nature also contend that societies have continued to expand rights as acceptance of the inherent moral worth of the potential new rights holders grows, and that this expansion of the circle of community should grow to encompass the natural world.\n\nAs of 2019 nature\u2019s rights laws exist at the local to national levels in 12 countries, including dozens of cities and counties across the United States, in the form of constitutional provisions, treaty agreements, statutes, local ordinances, and court decisions. \n\n==Basic tenets==\nProponents of rights of nature argue that, just as [[human rights]] have been increasingly recognized in  law, so should nature's rights be recognized and incorporated into human ethics and laws.

A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes.

The ordinary corporation is a \"person\" for purposes of the adjudicatory processes, whether it represents proprietary, spiritual, aesthetic, or charitable causes.<br/> So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes -- fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.

For example, the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] prioritizes protection of existing economic interests by activating only when species populations are headed toward extinction.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/> By contrast, a \u201cHealthy Species Act\u201d would prioritize achievement of thriving species populations, and facilitate economic systems that drive species conservation.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/>\n\nAs another example, the European Union's [[Water Framework Directive|Water Framework Directive]] of 2000, \u201cwidely accepted as the most substantial and ambitious piece of European environmental legislation to date,\u201d<ref name=\"Voulvoulis 2017\"/> relies on a target of \u201cgood status\u201d of all EU waters, which includes consideration of needed \u201cecological flows.\u201d<ref name=\"Ramos 2017\"/> However, decades after the Directive\u2019s adoption, there remains no EU definition of \u201cecological flow,\u201d nor a common understanding of how it should be calculated, despite scientific advances in identifying flow-ecology relationships.<ref name=\"Voulvoulis 2017\"/><ref name=\"Ramos 2017\"/> A nature\u2019s rights frame would recognize not only the existing [[Human right to water and sanitation|human right to water]] for basic needs, but would also recognize waterways\u2019 own rights to adequate, timely, clean water flows, and would define such basic ecological flow needs accordingly.<ref name=\"Sivas 2017\"/>\n\n===Underlying science and ethics===\nModern environmental laws began to arise in the 1960s out of a foundational perspective of the environment as best managed in discrete pieces.<ref name=\"Udall 1988\"/> For example, United States laws such as the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and numerous others began to be adopted in the early 1970s to address various elements of the natural world separately from other elements. Some laws, such as the U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]], called for a more holistic analysis of proposed infrastructure projects, and required the disclosure of expected negative environmental impacts. However, it did not require that actions be taken to address those impacts to ensure ecosystem and species health.<ref name=\"Sheehan Winter 2019\"/>\n\nThese laws reflected the science of the time, which was grounded in a [[Reductionism|reductionist]] analysis of the natural world; the modern, system-based understanding of the natural world, and humans\u2019 integrated place with it, was still in development.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/> The first major textbook on ecological science, which described the natural world as a system rather than a collection of different parts, was not written until 1983.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/><ref name=\"Odum 1983\"/> The [[Gaia Hypothesis]], which offered a scientific vision of the world as a self-regulating, complex system, first arose in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Jabr 2019\"/> [[System dynamics|Systems dynamics]] similarly began to evolve from a business focus to include socioeconomic and natural systems starting in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Meadows et al. 1972\"/> Since then scientific disciplines have been converging and advancing on the concept that humans live in a dynamic, relationship-based world that \u201cden[ies] the possibility of isolation.\u201d<ref name=\"Tribe 1974\"/><ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/>\n\nWhile science in the late 20th century shifted to a systems-based perspective, describing natural systems and human populations as fundamentally interconnected on a shared planet,<ref name=\"Thiele 2011\"/> environmental laws generally did not evolve with this shift. Reductionist U.S. environmental laws passed in the early 1970s remained largely unchanged, and other national and international environmental law regimes similarly stopped short of embracing the modern science of systems.<ref name=\"Cullinan 2011\"/>\n\nNineteenth century linguist and scholar [[Edward Payson Evans]], an early rights of nature theorist and author of \"the first extensive American statement of (...) environmental ethics,\u201d<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/> wrote that each human is \u201ctruly a part and product of Nature as any other animal, and [the] attempt to set him up on an isolated point outside of it is philosophically false and morally pernicious.\u201d<ref name=\"Evans 1897\"/><ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\n[[Thomas Berry]] proposed that society\u2019s laws should derive from the laws of nature, explaining that \u201cthe universe is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 2006\"/> From the scientific perspective that all life arose from the context of the universe, Berry offered the ethical perspective that it is flawed to view humans as the universe\u2019s only subjects, with all other beings merely a collection of objects to be owned and used. Rather, consideration of life as a web of relationships extending back to a shared ancestry confers subject status to all, including the inherent rights associated with that status.

From this worldview arises responsibilities to protect nature as one would a family member, and the need for a legal structure that reflects a primary frame of responsibilities to the natural world as kin.<ref name=\"Magallanes & Sheehan 2017\"/>\n\n===Common roots with world religions===\nMany of the world\u2019s other religious and spiritual traditions offer insights consistent with a nature\u2019s rights worldview.<ref name=\"Grim & Tucker 2014\"/> Eastern religious and philosophical traditions embrace a holistic conception of spirituality that includes the earth. Chinese [[Daoism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]], as well as Japanese [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]], teach that the world is a dynamic force field of energies known as [[Bussh\u014d (Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d)|bussho]] ([[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]] or [[Qi|qi]]), the material force that flows through humans, nature, and universe.

[[Mahayana]] Buddhism\u2019s \u201c[[Indra's Net]]\u201d symbolizes a universe of infinitely repeated mutual relations, with no one thing dominating.<ref name=\"Macy 1991\"/><ref name=\"Thiele 2011\"/>\n\nWestern religious and philosophical traditions as well have recognized the context of Earth and universe in providing spiritual guidance. From the Neolithic through the Bronze ages, the societies of \u201c[[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]]\u201d revered numerous female deities as incarnations of Mother Earth.<ref name=\"Capra 1996\"/> In early Greece, the earth Goddess [[Gaia|Gaia]] was worshipped as a supreme deity.<ref name=\"Spretnak 1981\"/> In the [[Philebus]] and [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Plato]] asserted that the \u201cworld is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence (...) a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.\u201d<ref name=\"Harding 2006\"/><ref name=\"Plato -Timaeus\"/> Medieval theologian [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] later wrote of the place of humans not at the center of being, but as one part of an integrated whole with the universe as primary, stating that the \u201cThe order of the universe is the ultimate and noblest perfection in things.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/><ref name=\"Thomas Aquinas\"/>\n\nMore recently, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], head of the [[Catholic church]], reflected that, \u201c[t]he obedience to the voice of Earth is more important for our future happiness...than the desires of the moment. Our Earth is talking to us and we must listen to it and decipher its message if we want to survive.\u201d<ref name=\"Catholic News Agency 2007\"/> His successor [[Pope Francis]] has been particularly vocal on humanity\u2019s relationship with the Earth, describing how humans must change their current actions in light of the fact that \u201ca true 'right of the environment' does exist.\"<ref name=\"Goldenberg & Kirchgaessner 2015\"/> He warned against humanity\u2019s current path, stating that \u201cthe deepest roots of our present failures\u201d lie in the direction and meaning of economic growth and the overarching rule of a \u201cdeified market.\"<ref name=\"Boori 2015\"/><ref name=\"Vidal 2014\"/><ref name=\"Pope Francis 2014\"/><ref name=\"Pope Francis 2015\"/><ref name=\"Yardley & Goodstein 2015\"/>\n\nThe [[Qur\u2019an]], Islam\u2019s primary authority in all matters of individual and communal life, further reflects that \u201cthe whole creation praises God by its very being.\u201d<ref name=\"Denny 1998\"/> Scholars describe the \u201cultimate purpose of the [[Sharia|Shari'ah]]\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/> as \u201dthe universal common good, the welfare of the entire creation,\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/> and note that \u201cnot a single creature, present or future, may be excluded from consideration in deciding a course of action.\u201d<ref name=\"Othman Abd ar-Rahman Llewellyn 1984\"/>\n\nBringing together Western and indigenous traditions, Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] spoke of \u201c[[Ubuntu philosophy|Ubuntu]],\u201d an African ethical concept that translates roughly to \u201cI am because you are,\u201d observing that: \"Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation.

Key to the development of those rights are the concepts of natural rights, and rights of humans emanating from the existence itself of humanity.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nRoderick Fraser Nash, professor of history and environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, traced the history of rights for species and the natural world back to the 13th century [[Magna Carta]]\u2019s launch of the concept of \u201c[[natural rights]],\u201d which underlies modern rights discourse.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nPeter Burdon, professor at the University of Adelaide Law School and an Earth Jurisprudence scholar, expanded upon Nash\u2019s analysis, offering that 17th century English philosopher and physician [[John Locke]]\u2019s transformative natural rights thesis led to the [[American Revolution]], through the concept that the British monarchy was denying colonists their natural rights.<ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/> Building on that concept, U.S. President, lawyer, and philosopher [[Thomas Jefferson]] argued that the \u201claws of nature and of nature\u2019s God\u201d reveal \u201cself-evident\u201d truths that \u201call men are created equal\u201d in their possession of \u201ccertain unalienable rights,\u201d particularly \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d The 1789 French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] later recognized as well the \u201cnatural, inalienable and sacred rights of man,\u201d adding that the \u201cfinal end of every political institution is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.\u201d<ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nThe expansion of rights continued out to animals, with 18-19th century English philosopher and legal theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] claiming that the \u201cday may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.\u201d<ref name=\"Bentham 1789\"/><ref name=\"Burdon 2011\"/> Nineteenth century linguist and scholar [[Edward Payson Evans]] observed that:<ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\n:\"[i]n tracing the history of the evolution of ethics we find the recognition of mutual rights and duties confined at first to members of the same horde or tribe, then extended to worshippers of the same gods, and gradually enlarged so as to include every civilized nation, until at length all races of men are at least theoretically conceived as being united in a common bond of brotherhood and benevolent sympathy, which is now slowly expanding so as to comprise not only the higher species of animals, but also every sensitive embodiment of organic life.\"<ref name=\"Evans 1897-b\"/><ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/>\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) in 1948 was another milestone, underpinned by the belief that fundamental human rights arise from \u201cthe fact of existing.\u201d<ref name=\"UN/Santa Cruz 1948\"/><ref name=\"Berry 1999\"/> The movement for rights of nature built on this belief, arguing that if \u201cexistence\u201d is the defining condition for fundamental rights, this defining condition could not be limited to the rights of only one form of existence, and that all forms of existence should enjoy fundamental rights.<ref name=\"Nash 1989\"/> For example, [[Aldo Leopold]]\u2019s land ethic explicitly recognized nature\u2019s \u201cright to continued existence\u201d<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/> and sought to \u201cchange the role of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it.\u201d<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/>\n\nProponents of the rights of nature also contend that from the [[abolition of slavery]], to the granting to [[Women's suffrage|women of the right to vote]], to the [[civil rights movement]] and recognition of other fundamental rights, societies have continued to expand rights in parallel with a growing acceptance of the inherent moral worth of the potential new rights holders.<ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/><ref name=\"Houck 2017\"/> And, that this expansion of the circle of community ought to continue to grow to encompass the natural world,<ref name=\"Leopold 1949\"/><ref name=\"Daily Targum 2019\"/> a position that has seen growing acceptance in the late 20th century and early 21st.<ref name=\"Kauffman 2020\"/><ref name=\"Daily Targum 2019\"/><ref name=\"United Nations, Harmony with Nature - list of initiatives\"/>\n\nProponents suggest that rights derived from existence in nature do not confer human rights to all beings, but rather confer unique rights to different kinds of beings. Thomas Berry put forth the theory that rights \u201care species specific and limited\u201d; that is, \u201crivers have river rights,\u201d \u201cbirds have bird rights,\u201d and \u201chumans have human rights;\u201d The difference is \u201cqualitative, not quantitative.\u201d<ref name=\"Berry 2006\"/><ref name=\"Stone 1996\"/>\n\nExtending this point, the common ethical and moral grounding of human rights and the rights of nature gives rise to the concept of \u201cco-violations\u201d of rights, defined as a \u201csituation in which governments, industries, or others violate both the rights of nature and human rights, including indigenous rights, with the same action.\u201d<ref name=\"Sheehan & Wilson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Wilson et al. 2016\"/> For example, in the Ecuadorian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], pollution from Texaco\u2019s (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) oil drilling operations from 1967 to 1992 resulted in an epidemic of birth defects, miscarriages, and an estimated 1,400 cancer deaths, and were particularly devastating to indigenous communities.

It was released on 4 January 1983 by [[RCA Records]]. The album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Dimery|author2=Michael Lydon|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die: Revised and Updated Edition|accessdate= |date=7 February 2006|publisher=Universe|isbn=0-7893-1371-5}}</ref>\n\n== Background and release ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Release and popularity ===\nAfter almost two years of initial commercial failure for Eurythmics, this album became a commercial breakthrough for the duo on both sides of the Atlantic. The title track became particularly popular and remains one of Eurythmics' most recognisable songs. Its music video, popular on MTV in the United States, is memorable for [[Annie Lennox]]'s [[Gender bender|gender-bending]] imagery. In the wake of this success, the single \"Love Is a Stranger\", previously a flop, was re-released and became a hit as well. It too was accompanied by a striking video that featured Lennox dressed both as a man and a woman.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2005 with all the Eurythmics' studio catalogue except the ''[[1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)]]'' album, to which [[Virgin Records]] holds the rights. The recordings were remastered and several bonus tracks added to each of eight albums. In this release, ''Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' acquired six bonus tracks.\n\n=== Recording ===\nDave Stewart, together with Robert Crash and ex-[[The Selecter]] bassist Adam Williams, produced the album in Eurythmics' own relatively primitive 8-track studio, winning awards for the quality of the recording that belied its low-budget origins. ''Sweet Dreams'' saw the duo move away from the psychedelic, guitar-tinged band-oriented sound of their 1981 debut album ''[[In the Garden (Eurythmics album)|In the Garden]]'', instead focusing on raw analogue synthesizers (including the [[Oberheim]] OB1 and [[EDP Wasp]]) and drum machines (particularly the [[Movement Systems Drum Computer]], which featured a graphic visual display of the drum patterns). Whilst the \"[[synthpop]]\" genre had grown in popularity in the preceding years, it was often associated with all-male groups and somewhat clinical, emotionless music. Eurythmics (particularly with Lennox's vocal stylings) brought a soul music twist to the electronic sound, which proved popular with broader audiences.\n\nEarly Australian, German and US CD releases (printed in Japan) and the 2005 reissue version of this album have a slightly longer version of \"This City Never Sleeps\". The length of 6:41 is due to some mixed sound effects and a [[Backmasking|backmasked]] message by David A. Stewart saying, \"I enjoyed making that there record. Very good, very good\" that total 21 seconds. This message also appears on original UK vinyl pressings.\n\nDuring 1982 Eurythmics recorded many tracks that ended up as B-sides of singles or as alternative versions of other songs. Tracks such as \"Step on the Beast\", \"Invisible Hands\", \"Dr. Trash\", or the alternative versions of \"The Walk\" have not been released on CD yet and any future plans for re-release are unknown at this time. However, these tracks can now be heard through [[YouTube]].\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A.

It was released on 4 January 1983 by [[RCA Records]]. The album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Dimery|author2=Michael Lydon|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die: Revised and Updated Edition|accessdate= |date=7 February 2006|publisher=Universe|isbn=0-7893-1371-5}}</ref>\n\n== Background and release ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Release and popularity ===\nAfter almost two years of initial commercial failure for Eurythmics, this album became a commercial breakthrough for the duo on both sides of the Atlantic. The title track became particularly popular and remains one of Eurythmics' most recognisable songs. Its music video, popular on MTV in the United States, is memorable for [[Annie Lennox]]'s [[Gender bender|gender-bending]] imagery. In the wake of this success, the single \"Love Is a Stranger\", previously a flop, was re-released and became a hit as well. It too was accompanied by a striking video that featured Lennox dressed both as a man and a woman.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2005 with all the Eurythmics' studio catalogue except the ''[[1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)]]'' album, to which [[Virgin Records]] holds the rights. The recordings were remastered and several bonus tracks added to each of eight albums. In this release, ''Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' acquired six bonus tracks.\n\n=== Recording ===\nDave Stewart, together with Robert Crash and ex-[[The Selecter]] bassist Adam Williams, produced the album in Eurythmics' own relatively primitive 8-track studio, winning awards for the quality of the recording that belied its low-budget origins. ''Sweet Dreams'' saw the duo move away from the psychedelic, guitar-tinged band-oriented sound of their 1981 debut album ''[[In the Garden (Eurythmics album)|In the Garden]]'', instead focusing on raw analogue synthesizers (including the [[Oberheim]] OB1 and [[EDP Wasp]]) and drum machines (particularly the [[Movement Systems Drum Computer]], which featured a graphic visual display of the drum patterns). Whilst the \"[[synthpop]]\" genre had grown in popularity in the preceding years, it was often associated with all-male groups and somewhat clinical, emotionless music. Eurythmics (particularly with Lennox's vocal stylings) brought a soul music twist to the electronic sound, which proved popular with broader audiences.\n\nEarly Australian, German and US CD releases (printed in Japan) and the 2005 reissue version of this album have a slightly longer version of \"This City Never Sleeps\". The length of 6:41 is due to some mixed sound effects and a [[Backmasking|backmasked]] message by David A. Stewart saying, \"I enjoyed making that there record. Very good, very good\" that total 21 seconds. This message also appears on original UK vinyl pressings.\n\nDuring 1982 Eurythmics recorded many tracks that ended up as B-sides of singles or as alternative versions of other songs. Tracks such as \"Step on the Beast\", \"Invisible Hands\", \"Dr. Trash\", or the alternative versions of \"The Walk\" have not been released on CD yet and any future plans for re-release are unknown at this time. However, these tracks can now be heard through [[YouTube]].\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A.

The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. The city was once called the ''[[Venice of the East]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj8cderhbr8C&pg=PA57|title=Cities and Natural Process: A Basis for Sustainability|first=Michael|last=Hough|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> Under the [[British Empire]], the city saw the introduction of [[electricity]], [[railway]]s, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply.

The city is located in an eponymous [[Dhaka District|district]] and [[Dhaka Division|division]].\n\nThe area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. The city was once called the ''[[Venice of the East]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj8cderhbr8C&pg=PA57|title=Cities and Natural Process: A Basis for Sustainability|first=Michael|last=Hough|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> Under the [[British Empire]], the city saw the introduction of [[electricity]], [[railway]]s, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply.

Once ''[[Butea frondosa|dhak]]'' trees were very common in the area and the name may have originated from it.
