The film was directed by director [[Leonid Gaidai]] and starred several famous Soviet actors, including [[Yuri Nikulin]], [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], [[Anatoli Papanov]], [[Nonna Mordyukova]] and [[Svetlana Svetlichnaya]]. ''The Diamond Arm'' has become a Russian [[cult film]] and is considered by many Russian contemporaries to be one of the finest comedies of all time. It was also one of [[List of Soviet films of the year by ticket sales|the all-time leaders at the Soviet box office]] with over 76,700,000 theatre admissions in the [[Soviet era]]. The plot of the film was based on a real-life news item about Swiss smugglers who tried to transport jewels in an orthopedic cast.\n\n==Plot==\nThe boss of a [[black market]] ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of [[jewelry]] from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the [[orthopedic cast]] of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy 'Gesha' Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to [[Turkey]] via a tourist cruise ship. The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Gesha and Lyolik (another of Chief's henchmen, played by Papanov) attempt to lure Gorbunkov into situations where they can quietly, without a [[wet job]], remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels.\n\nOn one such occasion, Gesha invites Gorbunkov to a fancy restaurant with the intention of getting Gorbunkov drunk enough for Lyolik to subdue him. However, both Gesha and Gorbunkov become drunk and Gorbunkov is taken home by the police after he and Gesha cause a scene. Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect either that he has been recruited by foreign intelligence after finding a large amount of money and a gun loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] in Gorbunkov's possession (previously given to him by the police), or that he is having an affair. Gorbunkov explains that he is working with the Soviet police on a secret mission, but cannot divulge any details. The Chief sends Anna Sergeyevna, a female operative, to help retrieve the cast. Sergeyevna invites Gorbunkov to her hotel room under the pretense of wanting to sell Gorbunkov a gown and spikes his drink with a sleeping pill. As Gorbunkov is about to pass out, his building's nosy superintendent who had followed Gorbunkov brings his wife into the hotel room before either Lyolik or the police can get to him.\n\nGorbunkov awakens the next morning to find that his wife has assumed that his story was all a cover up for an [[affair]], and has left with the children. The police in the meantime have deduced that Gesha is involved with the smuggling scheme surrounding the cast, and ask Gorbunkov to mention to Gesha that he is planning to travel to another city and will have his cast removed there. Gesha reports this to the Chief, who sends Lyolik disguised as a taxi driver to pick up Gorbunkov. Gorbunkov assumes that Lyolik is also an undercover policeman, and gives away the fact that he has been in contact with the police the entire time. Lyolik plays along and tells Gorbunkov that he has been authorized to remove the cast a day early at a safehouse along the way to Dubrovka. As Lyolik is about to remove the cast, Gorbunkov deduces that Lyolik is actually a criminal and attempts to escape. Lyolik and Gesha chase Gorbunkov and with the help of the Chief himself, they capture Gorbunkov. Upon removing Gorbunkov's cast, they realize that the police had removed the diamonds in the cast a long time ago. The criminals kidnap Gorbunkov and attempt to flee as the police track them down in a helicopter and capture them. Gorbunkov is reunited with his family, with the police having explained the situation to his wife. Gorbunkov goes on vacation with his family, albeit now with a broken leg as a result of the kidnapping.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]], Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov, an economist at the State Institute for the Planning of Fisheries\n* [[Nina Grebeshkova]], Nadia, Gorbunkov's wife\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], Gennadiy Kozodoyev, aka Gesha, a male model, Chief's assistant\n* [[Anatoli Papanov]], Lyolik, Chief's assistant, a tough guy\n* [[Nonna Mordyukova]], Varvara Pliushch, upravdom (building superintendent)\n* [[Svetlana Svetlichnaya]], Anna Sergeyevna, a [[femme fatale]]\n* [[Stanislav Chekan]], Mikhail Ivanovich, Captain, then Major of [[militsiya]]\n* [[Vladimir Gulyaev]], Volodya, Lieutenant of [[militsiya]]\n* [[Andrei Fajt]], salesman of lottery tickets, visitor of the restaurant \"Weeping willow\"\n* [[Nikolay Trofimov]], Colonel of [[militsiya]]\n* [[Nikolay Romanov]], Chief of crime gang\n* [[Alexander Khvylya]], Boris Savelyevich, maitre d'hotel of the restaurant \"Weeping willow\"\n* [[Tatyana Nikulina]], tour guide\n* [[Maksim Nikulin]], boy with a net (not credited)\n* [[Leonid Gaidai]], alcoholic (not credited, voiced by [[Georgy Vitsin]]) and the hand that chokes Kozodoyev in his dream (also not credited)\n* [[Igor Yasulovich]], dog owner\n* [[Roman Filippov]], visitor from [[Kolyma]]\n* [[Viktoria Ostrovskaya]], prostitute\n\n==Production==\nAmerican cars can be spotted in the Oriental city street scenes (which were actually shot in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], USSR): a 1954 [[Chevrolet 210]], a 1955 [[Buick]] and a 1951 [[Oldsmobile Super 88]].

The film was directed by director [[Leonid Gaidai]] and starred several famous Soviet actors, including [[Yuri Nikulin]], [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], [[Anatoli Papanov]], [[Nonna Mordyukova]] and [[Svetlana Svetlichnaya]]. ''The Diamond Arm'' has become a Russian [[cult film]] and is considered by many Russian contemporaries to be one of the finest comedies of all time. It was also one of [[List of Soviet films of the year by ticket sales|the all-time leaders at the Soviet box office]] with over 76,700,000 theatre admissions in the [[Soviet era]]. The plot of the film was based on a real-life news item about Swiss smugglers who tried to transport jewels in an orthopedic cast.\n\n==Plot==\nThe boss of a [[black market]] ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of [[jewelry]] from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the [[orthopedic cast]] of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy 'Gesha' Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to [[Turkey]] via a tourist cruise ship. The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Gesha and Lyolik (another of Chief's henchmen, played by Papanov) attempt to lure Gorbunkov into situations where they can quietly, without a [[wet job]], remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels.\n\nOn one such occasion, Gesha invites Gorbunkov to a fancy restaurant with the intention of getting Gorbunkov drunk enough for Lyolik to subdue him. However, both Gesha and Gorbunkov become drunk and Gorbunkov is taken home by the police after he and Gesha cause a scene. Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect either that he has been recruited by foreign intelligence after finding a large amount of money and a gun loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] in Gorbunkov's possession (previously given to him by the police), or that he is having an affair. Gorbunkov explains that he is working with the Soviet police on a secret mission, but cannot divulge any details. The Chief sends Anna Sergeyevna, a female operative, to help retrieve the cast. Sergeyevna invites Gorbunkov to her hotel room under the pretense of wanting to sell Gorbunkov a gown and spikes his drink with a sleeping pill. As Gorbunkov is about to pass out, his building's nosy superintendent who had followed Gorbunkov brings his wife into the hotel room before either Lyolik or the police can get to him.\n\nGorbunkov awakens the next morning to find that his wife has assumed that his story was all a cover up for an [[affair]], and has left with the children.

The weebill's plumage is nondescript, with olive-grey upperparts and paler, more yellowish underparts. It grades from more brownish plumage in the southern regions of Australia to more yellow in tropical areas.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe weebill was described by John Gould in 1838 as ''Psilopus brevirostris''.
