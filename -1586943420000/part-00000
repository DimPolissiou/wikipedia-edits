Sandaime J Soul Brothers' debut single \"Best Friend's Girl\" and their subsequent releases from their first two albums \"J Soul Brothers\" and \"Tribal Soul\" were predominantly influenced by [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and soul. Their first number one single \"Fighters\" from their second album was one their first A-side tracks featuring an uptempo rock style distinctly similar to their senior label-mate group [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] whose leader Hiro oversaw the production of the first two albums with already well established producers such T.Kura and Michico. \nTheir third studio album \"Miracle\" noticeably rebounds from earlier genres as it integrates faster uptempo songs \"Look @ Us Now\" and \"Let's Party\", both tracks being produced again by producer duo T.Kura and Michico. In addition to being their first number one album, \"Miracle\" featured the critically acclaimed track \"Hanabi\" which would eventually earn Sandaime J Soul Brothers public notoriety and their first appearance at the prestigious NHK's year-end show [[Kohaku Uta Gassen]]. Hanabi was written from a relationship's female perspective and it explores themes of break up, loss and coming-of-age represented on the summer season ending. These themes would later be prominent on future ballads performed by the group.<ref>{{cite news | work=Natalie.mu | url=https://natalie.mu/music/pp/jsoulbrothers | title=\u4e09\u4ee3\u76ee J Soul Brothers\u300c0\uff5eZERO\uff5e\u300d\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc| date=2012-08-08 | accessdate=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n|filename=Sandaime J Soul Brothers - Feel So Alive.ogg\n|title=\"Feel So Alive\" (2016)\n|description=\"Feel So Alive\" primarily a hip-hop song was partly written by member Elly.

In addition, lead performer ELLY participated in the composition and recording of releases like \"Feel So Alive\" and \"J.S.B Love\", both tracks featuring hip-hop and EDM influences that bent the dynamic of the group more towards an urban sound.

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped Nazi Germany prior to the WWII.<ref name=\"father\"/> Her parents emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt\u2019s extolling of men\u2019s rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Gleeson has said that \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nGleeson says it was during the conservative [[Howard government]] (1996-2007) that Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]].<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>  A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet_Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia\u2019s first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''Thinkspot'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General_of_Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Victorian Liberal shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy_of_Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from [[Australian Liberal Party|Liberal]], [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum_vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped Nazi Germany prior to the WWII.<ref name=\"father\"/> Her parents emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt\u2019s extolling of men\u2019s rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Gleeson has said that \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nGleeson says it was during the conservative [[Howard government]] (1996-2007) that Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]].<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>  A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet_Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia\u2019s first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''Thinkspot'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General_of_Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Victorian Liberal shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy_of_Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from [[Australian Liberal Party|Liberal]], [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum_vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being
