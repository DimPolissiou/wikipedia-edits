Prospering from its location on the [[Silk Road]] between [[China]] and the Mediterranean, at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Guidebook of history of Samarkand\", {{ISBN|978-9943-01-139-7}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia, it was the capital of the [[Sogdia]]n [[satrap]]y.

In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and is the site of his mausoleum (the [[Gur-e Amir]]).

A group of [[Mesolithic]] era (12th\u20137th millennium BC) archeological sites were discovered at Sazag'on-1, Zamichatosh and Okhalik (suburbs of the city). The Syob and Darg'om canals, supplying the city and its suburbs with water, appeared around the 7th to 5th centuries BC (early [[Iron Age]]). There is no direct evidence when Samarkand was founded. Researchers of the Institute of Archeology of Samarkand argue for the existence of the city between the 8th and 7th centuries BC.\n\nSamarkand has been one of the main centres of [[Sogdia]]n  civilization from its early days. By the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasty of Persia it had become the capital of the Sogdian [[satrap]]y.\n\n===Hellenistic period===\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Samarkand in 329 BC. The city was known as '''Maracanda''' by the Greeks.<ref>''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972 reprint) p. 1657</ref> Written sources offer small clues as to the subsequent system of government.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=London}}</ref> They tell of an Orepius who became ruler \"not from ancestors, but as a gift of Alexander\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shichkina|first=G.V.|title=Ancient Samarkand: capital of Soghd|journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute|year=1994|volume=8|page=83}}</ref>\n\nWhile Samarkand suffered significant damage during Alexander's initial conquest, the city recovered rapidly and flourished under the new Hellenic influence. There were also major new construction techniques; oblong bricks were replaced with square ones and superior methods of masonry and plastering were introduced.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shichkina|first=G.V.|title=Ancient Samarkand: capital of Soghd|journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute|year=1994|volume=8|page=86}}</ref>\n\nAlexander's conquests introduced classical Greek culture into Central Asia; for a time, Greek aesthetics heavily influenced local artisans. This Hellenistic legacy continued as the city became part of various successor states in the centuries following Alexander's death, i.e. the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and [[Kushan Empire]] (even though the [[Yuezhi|Kushana]] themselves originated in Central Asia). After  the Kushan state lost control of Sogdia, during the 3rd century AD, Samarkand went into decline as a centre of economic, cultural and political power. It did not significantly revive until the 5th century AD.\n\n===Sassanian era===\n[[File:Samarqand.jpg|thumb|Downtown with Bibi-Khanym Mosque in 1990s]]\nSamarkand was conquered by the Persian [[Sassanians]] around 260 AD. Under Sassanian rule, the region became an essential site for [[Manichaeism]], and facilitated the dissemination of the religion throughout Central Asia.<ref name=\"Dumper, Stanley 2007 319\">{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California|page=319}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Hephtalites]] (Huns) conquered Samarkand, they controlled it until the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]], in an alliance with the Sassanid Persians, won it at the [[Battle of Bukhara]]. The Turks ruled over Samarkand until they were defeated by the [[Sassanids]] during the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk\u2013Persian Wars]].\n\n===Early Islamic era===\nAfter the [[Islamic conquest of Iran|Arab conquest of Iran]], the Turks conquered Samarkand and held it until the [[Conquest of the Western Turks|Turkic Khaganate collapsed]] due to wars with the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]. During this time the city became a protectorate and paid tribute to the ruling Tang. The armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] captured the city in circa 710 from the Turks.<ref name=\"Dumper, Stanley 2007 319\"/> During this period, Samarkand was a diverse religious community and was home to a number of religions, including [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Nestorian Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California}}</ref> Central Asia was generally not settled with Arabs by Qutayba, who forced the local rulers to pay tribute but largely left them to their own devices; Samarkand was the major exception to this policy and an Arab garrison and administration was established in the city, its Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s were razed and a mosque was built.<ref name=\"Wellhausen437438\">{{cite book |last1=Wellhausen |first1=J. |authorlink=Julius Wellhausen |editor1-last=Weir |editor1-first=Margaret Graham |title=The Arab Kingdom and its Fall |date=1927 |publisher=University of Calcutta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxPKpCcVOdcC |pages=437\u2013438}}</ref> Much of the population of the city converted to Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|title=Life Along the Silk Road|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=California|page=33}}</ref> As a long-term result, Samarkand developed into a center of Islamic and Arabic learning.<ref name=\"Wellhausen437438\"/>\n\nLegend has it that during [[Abbasid]] rule,<ref>Quraishi, Silim \"A survey of the development of papermaking in Islamic Countries\", ''Bookbinder'', 1989 (3): 29\u201336.</ref> the secret of [[papermaking]] was obtained from two [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prisoners from the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751, which led to the foundation of the first [[paper mill]] of the Islamic world in Samarkand. The invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world, and from there to Europe.\n\nAbbasid control of Samarkand soon dissipated and was replaced with that of the [[Samanids]] (862\u2013999), though the Samanids were still nominal vassals of the Caliph during their control of Samarkand. Under Samanid rule the city became one of the capitals of the Samanid dynasty and an even more important link amongst numerous trade routes. The Samanids were overthrown by the [[Karakhanids]] around 1000. During the next two hundred years, Samarkand would be ruled by a succession of Turkic tribes, including the [[Seljuqs]] and the [[Khwarazm]]-Shahs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California|page=320}}</ref>\n\nThe 10th-century Iranian author Istakhri, who travelled in [[Transoxiana]], provides a vivid description of the natural riches of the region he calls \"Smarkandian Sogd\":\n\n<blockquote>I know no place in it or in Samarkand itself where if one ascends some elevated ground one does not see greenery and a pleasant place, and nowhere near it are mountains lacking in trees or a dusty steppe... Samakandian Sogd... [extends] eight days travel through unbroken greenery and gardens... . The greenery of the trees and sown land extends along both sides of the river [Sogd]... and beyond these fields is pasture for flocks. Every town and settlement has a fortress... It is the most fruitful of all the countries of Allah; in it are the best trees and fruits, in every home are gardens, cisterns and flowing water.</blockquote>\n\n===Mongol period===\nThe Mongols [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia#Samarkand|conquered Samarkand]] in 1220. Although [[Genghis Khan]] \"did not disturb the inhabitants [of the city] in any way\", according to [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvaini]] he killed all who took refuge in the citadel and the mosque, pillaged the city completely and conscripted 30,000 young men along with 30,000 craftsmen. Samarkand suffered at least one other Mongol sack by [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)|Khan Baraq]] to get treasure he needed to pay an army. It remained part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (one of four Mongol successor realms) until 1370.\n\n''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|The Travels]]'' of [[Marco Polo]], where Polo records his journey along the Silk Road in the late 13th century, describes Samarkand as \"a very large and splendid city...\"\n\nThe Yenisei area had [[Semu#Similar practices in other areas of the Mongol Empire|a community of weavers of Chinese origin]] and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by [[Qiu Chuji|Changchun]].<ref name=\"Gernet1996\">{{cite book|author=Jacques Gernet |title=A History of Chinese Civilization |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern |url-access=registration |date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-49781-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern/page/377 377]\u2013}}</ref> After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.<ref>{{cite book |title= E.J.W.

Timur gained a reputation as a patron of the arts and Samarkand grew to become the centre of the region of [[Transoxiana]]. Timur's commitment to the arts is evident in the way he was ruthless with his enemies but merciful towards those with special artistic abilities, sparing the lives of artists, craftsmen and architects so that he could bring them to improve and beautify his capital. He was also directly involved in his construction projects and his visions often exceeded the technical abilities of his workers. Furthermore, the city was in a state of constant construction and Timur would often request buildings to be done and redone quickly if he was unsatisfied with the results.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\">{{cite journal|last=Marefat|first=Roya|title=The Heavenly City of Samarkand|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|date=Summer 1992|volume=16|issue=3|pages=33\u201338|jstor=40258334}}</ref> Timur made it so that the city could only be reached by roads and also ordered the construction of deep ditches and walls, that would run {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip|0}} in circumference, separating the city from the rest of its surrounding neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Roads: two thousand ears in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=Berkeley|pages=136\u20137}}</ref> During this time the city had a population of about 150,000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer'', p. 1657</ref> This great period of reconstruction is encapsulated in the account of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]]'s ambassador, [[Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo]], who was stationed there between 1403 and 1406.

National Identity and the Origins of the Republic''. International Library of Central Asia Studies. [[I.B. Tauris]]. 2007.

As explained by [[Paul Bergne]]:\n<blockquote>During the census of 1926 a significant part of the Tajik population was registered as Uzbek. Thus, for example, in the 1920 census in Samarkand city the Tajiks were recorded as numbering 44,758 and the Uzbeks only 3301. According to the 1926 census, the number of Uzbeks was recorded as 43,364 and the Tajiks as only 10,716. In a series of kishlaks [villages] in the Khojand Okrug, whose population was registered as Tajik in 1920 e.g. in Asht, Kalacha, Akjar i Tajik and others, in the 1926 census they were registered as Uzbeks. Similar facts can be adduced also with regard to Ferghana, Samarkand, and especially the Bukhara oblasts.<ref name=\"PB\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Uzbeks]] are in fact an ethnic minority in Samarkand, second to the Tajiks, and are most concentrated in the west of Samarkand.\n\nAlso in Samarkand there is a large diaspora of [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Tatars]], [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]], [[Poles]], and [[Germans]], all of whom live primarily in the center and in the west of Samarkand. The main language of these nationalities is [[Russian language]].

The population of the Samarqand Vilayat is more than 3,720,000 people (2019). There are no exact data on the number of Shiites in the city of Samarqand. Samarqand Vilayat is one of the two regions of Uzbekistan (along with [[Buxoro Region|Bukhara Vilayat]]), where a large number of Shiites live. In other regions of Uzbekistan there are few Shiites. In Samarqand, there are several Shiite [[mosque]]s and madrasas. For example, the largest of them are the Punjabi Mosque and the Punjabi Madrassah, the Mausoleum of Mourad Avliya. Every year, Shiites of Samarkand celebrate [[Ashura]], as well as other memorable dates and holidays of Shiites. The total number of followers of Shiism in Uzbekistan is not officially announced, but is estimated at \"several hundred thousand.\" According to [[WikiLeaks]], in 2007\u20132008, the [[United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom|US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom]] held a series of meetings with Sunni [[mullah]]s and Shiite [[imam]]s in Uzbekistan. During one of the talks, the Imam of the Shiite mosque in [[Bukhara]] said that about 300 thousand Shiites live in the Bukhara Vliayat and another million in the Samarqand Vilayat. The Ambassador slightly doubted the authenticity of these figures, emphasizing in his report that the data on the number of religious and ethnic minorities by the government of Uzbekistan are considered to be a very \"delicate topic\" in order not to provoke interethnic and inter-religious contradictions. All the ambassadors of the ambassador tried to emphasize that traditional Islam, especially [[Sufism]] and [[Sunnism]] in the regions of Bukhara and Samarqand, is characterized by great religious tolerance and tolerance towards other religious movements, including Shiites<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamsng.com/uzb/pastfuture/5570|title=\u0428\u0438\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435|work=www.islamsng.com|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.kz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1545:2013-11-29-08-08-10&catid=2:2011-10-23-11-43-45&Itemid=17|title=\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043e\u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0448\u0438\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432|work=www.dn.kz|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://catoday.org/centrasia/uzbekistan-irancy-shiity-stalkivayutsya-c-problemami-s-pravoohranitelnymi-organami-iran|title=\u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d: \u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b-\u0448\u0438\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438|work=catoday.org|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nShiites in Samarqand are mostly [[:ru:\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b|Samarqandian Iranians]], who call themselves ''Irani''.

At that time, the majority of the population of Samarkand were [[Zoroastrians]], but since Samarkand was the crossroads of caravans between [[History of China|China]], [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Europe]], this city was religiously tolerant. Thus, [[Christianity]] appeared in Samarkand long before the penetration of [[Islam]] into Central Asia.

According to [[Marco Polo]] and Johann Elemosina, a descendant of [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatai Khan]], the founder of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatai dynasty]], [[Eljigidey]] converted to Christianity and was baptized. With the assistance of Eljigidey, the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist was built in Samarkand. After a while Islam completely supplanted Catholicism.\n\nChristianity reappeared in Samarkand several centuries later, from the mid-19th century.

Eisenhower Library, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. Fols. 359v-36or.]]\n\nTimur initiated the building of Bibi Khanum after his campaign in India in 1398\u20131399. Before its reconstruction after an earthquake in 1897, Bibi Khanum had around 450 marble columns that were established with the help of 95 elephants that Timur had brought back from Hindustan. Also from India, artisans and stonemasons designed the mosque's dome, giving it its distinctiveness amongst the other buildings.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe best-known structure in Samarkand is the mausoleum known as Gur-i Amir. It exhibits many cultures and influences from past civilizations, neighboring peoples, and especially those of Islam. Despite how much devastation the Mongols caused in the past to all of the Islamic architecture that had existed in the city prior to Timur's succession, much of the destroyed Islamic influences were revived, recreated, and restored under Timur. The blueprint and layout of the mosque itself follows the Islamic passion of geometry and other elements of the structure had been precisely measured. The entrance to the Gur-i Amir is decorated with Arabic calligraphy and inscriptions, the latter being a common feature in Islamic architecture. The attention to detail and meticulous nature of Timur is especially obvious when looking inside the building. Inside, the walls have been covered in tiles through a technique, originally developed in Iran, called \"mosaic faience,\" a process where each tile is cut, colored, and fit into place individually.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>  The tiles were also arranged in a specific way that would engrave words relating to the city's religiosity; words like \"Muhammad\" and \"Allah\" have been spelled out on the walls using the tiles.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe ornaments and decorations of the walls include floral and vegetal symbols which are used to signify gardens. Gardens are commonly interpreted as paradise in the Islamic religion and they were both inscribed in tomb walls and grown in the city itself.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/> In the city of Samarkand, there were two major gardens, the New Garden and the Garden of Heart's Delight, and these became the central areas of entertainment for ambassadors and important guests. A friend of Genghis Khan in 1218 named Yel\u00fc Chucai, reported that Samarkand was the most beautiful city of all where \"it was surrounded by numerous gardens. Every household had a garden, and all the gardens were well designed, with canals and water fountains that supplied water to round or square-shaped ponds. The landscape included rows of willows and cypress trees, and peach and plum orchards were shoulder to shoulder.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Xinru|title=The Silk Road in world history|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-516174-8}}</ref> The floors of the mausoleum are entirely covered with uninterrupted patterns of tiles of flowers, emphasizing the presence of Islam and Islamic art in the city. In addition, Persian carpets with floral printings have been found in some of the Timurid buildings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Wiener|first=Ernst|title=An Unknown Timurid Building|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date=June 1935|volume=66|issue=387|pages=272\u2013273+277|jstor=866154}}</ref>\n\nTurko-Mongol influence is also apparent in the architecture of the buildings in Samarkand. For instance, nomads previously used ''[[yurt]]s'', traditional Mongol tents, to display the bodies of the dead before they were to engage in proper burial procedures. Similarly, it is believed that the melon-shaped domes of the tomb chambers are imitations of those yurts. Timur naturally used stronger materials, like bricks and wood, to establish these tents, but their purposes remain largely unchanged.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe elements of traditional Islamic architecture can be seen in traditional Uzbek houses that are built around central courtyards with gardens.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/|title=Samarkand  \u2013 Crossroad of Cultures|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> The houses are built from mud brick and most have painted wooden ceilings and wall decorations. Houses in the west of the city are indicative of European style homes built in 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe color of the buildings in Samarkand also has significant meaning behind it. For instance, blue is the most common and dominant color that will be found on the buildings, which was used by Timur in order to symbolize a large range of ideas. For one, the blue shades seen in the Gur-i Amir are colors of mourning. Blue was the color of mourning in Central Asia at the time, as it is in many cultures even today, so its dominance in the city's mausoleum appears only logical. In addition, blue was also seen as the color that would ward off \"the [[evil eye]]\" in Central Asia and the notion is evident in the number of doors in and around the city that were colored blue during this time. Furthermore, blue was representative of water, which was a particularly rare resource around the Middle East and Central Asia; coloring the walls blue symbolized the wealth of the city.\n\nGold also has a strong presence in the city. Timur's fascination with vaulting explains the excessive use of gold in the Gur-i Amir as well as the use of embroidered gold fabric in both the city and his buildings. The Mongols had great interests in Chinese- and Persian-style golden silk textiles as well as [[nasij]] woven in Iran and Transoxiana. Past Mongol leaders, like Ogodei, built textile workshops in their cities in order to be able to produce gold fabrics themselves.\n\nThere is evidence that Timur tried to preserve his Mongol roots. In the chamber in which his body was laid, \"[[tuq]]s\" were found \u2013 those are poles with horses' tails hanging at the top, which was symbolic of an ancient Turkic tradition where horses, which were valuable commodities, were sacrificed in order to honor the dead,<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/> and a cavalry standard type shared by many nomads, up to the Ottoman Turks.\n\n== Transport ==\nPublic transport is developed in Samarkand. [[Municipal bus]] (mostly [[SamAuto]] and [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] buses) is the most common and popular transport in the city. Also in the city since 2017 there are [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0439|several Samarkandian tram lines]] (tram existed in Samarkand also in 1947-1973), mostly Vario LF.S Czech trams. Also, the city very much a city [[taxi]] (mostly [[Chevrolet]] and [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] sedans), which is usually yellow in color. Also in the city a lot of [[taxi]]s, which are usually yellow.

This railway started from Krasnovodsk (now [[T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]]) on the [[Caspian Sea]] coast and ended at the station of Samarkand. It was Samarkand station that was the final station of the Trans-Caspian railway.

A group of [[Mesolithic]] era (12th\u20137th millennium BC) archeological sites were discovered at Sazag'on-1, Zamichatosh and Okhalik (suburbs of the city). The Syob and Darg'om canals, supplying the city and its suburbs with water, appeared around the 7th to 5th centuries BC (early [[Iron Age]]). There is no direct evidence when Samarkand was founded.

This Hellenistic legacy continued as the city became part of various successor states in the centuries following Alexander's death, i.e. the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and [[Kushan Empire]] (even though the [[Yuezhi|Kushana]] themselves originated in Central Asia). After  the Kushan state lost control of Sogdia, during the 3rd century AD, Samarkand went into decline as a centre of economic, cultural and political power.

The Turks ruled over Samarkand until they were defeated by the [[Sassanids]] during the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk\u2013Persian Wars]].\n\n===Early Islamic era===\nAfter the [[Islamic conquest of Iran|Arab conquest of Iran]], the Turks conquered Samarkand and held it until the [[Conquest of the Western Turks|Turkic Khaganate collapsed]] due to wars with the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]. During this time the city became a protectorate and paid tribute to the ruling Tang. The armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] captured the city in circa 710 from the Turks.<ref name=\"Dumper, Stanley 2007 319\"/> During this period, Samarkand was a diverse religious community and was home to a number of religions, including [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Nestorian Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California}}</ref> Central Asia was generally not settled with Arabs by Qutayba, who forced the local rulers to pay tribute but largely left them to their own devices; Samarkand was the major exception to this policy and an Arab garrison and administration was established in the city, its Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s were razed and a mosque was built.<ref name=\"Wellhausen437438\">{{cite book |last1=Wellhausen |first1=J. |authorlink=Julius Wellhausen |editor1-last=Weir |editor1-first=Margaret Graham |title=The Arab Kingdom and its Fall |date=1927 |publisher=University of Calcutta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxPKpCcVOdcC |pages=437\u2013438}}</ref> Much of the population of the city converted to Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|title=Life Along the Silk Road|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=California|page=33}}</ref> As a long-term result, Samarkand developed into a center of Islamic and Arabic learning.<ref name=\"Wellhausen437438\"/>\n\nLegend has it that during [[Abbasid]] rule,<ref>Quraishi, Silim \"A survey of the development of papermaking in Islamic Countries\", ''Bookbinder'', 1989 (3): 29\u201336.</ref> the secret of [[papermaking]] was obtained from two [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prisoners from the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751, which led to the foundation of the first [[paper mill]] of the Islamic world in Samarkand. The invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world, and from there to Europe.\n\nAbbasid control of Samarkand soon dissipated and was replaced with that of the [[Samanids]] (862\u2013999), though the Samanids were still nominal vassals of the Caliph during their control of Samarkand. Under Samanid rule the city became one of the capitals of the Samanid dynasty and an even more important link amongst numerous trade routes. The Samanids were overthrown by the [[Karakhanids]] around 1000. During the next two hundred years, Samarkand would be ruled by a succession of Turkic tribes, including the [[Seljuqs]] and the [[Khwarazm]]-Shahs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California|page=320}}</ref>\n\nThe 10th-century Iranian author Istakhri, who travelled in [[Transoxiana]], provides a vivid description of the natural riches of the region he calls \"Smarkandian Sogd\":\n\n<blockquote>I know no place in it or in Samarkand itself where if one ascends some elevated ground one does not see greenery and a pleasant place, and nowhere near it are mountains lacking in trees or a dusty steppe... Samakandian Sogd... [extends] eight days travel through unbroken greenery and gardens... . The greenery of the trees and sown land extends along both sides of the river [Sogd]... and beyond these fields is pasture for flocks. Every town and settlement has a fortress... It is the most fruitful of all the countries of Allah; in it are the best trees and fruits, in every home are gardens, cisterns and flowing water.</blockquote>\n\n===Mongol period===\nThe Mongols [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia#Samarkand|conquered Samarkand]] in 1220. Although [[Genghis Khan]] \"did not disturb the inhabitants [of the city] in any way\", according to [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvaini]] he killed all who took refuge in the citadel and the mosque, pillaged the city completely and conscripted 30,000 young men along with 30,000 craftsmen. Samarkand suffered at least one other Mongol sack by [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)|Khan Baraq]] to get treasure he needed to pay an army. It remained part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (one of four Mongol successor realms) until 1370.\n\n''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|The Travels]]'' of [[Marco Polo]], where Polo records his journey along the Silk Road in the late 13th century, describes Samarkand as \"a very large and splendid city...\"\n\nThe Yenisei area had [[Semu#Similar practices in other areas of the Mongol Empire|a community of weavers of Chinese origin]] and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by [[Qiu Chuji|Changchun]].<ref name=\"Gernet1996\">{{cite book|author=Jacques Gernet |title=A History of Chinese Civilization |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern |url-access=registration |date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-49781-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern/page/377 377]\u2013}}</ref> After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.<ref>{{cite book |title= E.J.W.

During the next 35 years, he rebuilt most of the city and populated it with the great artisans and craftsmen from across the empire. Timur gained a reputation as a patron of the arts and Samarkand grew to become the centre of the region of [[Transoxiana]]. Timur's commitment to the arts is evident in the way he was ruthless with his enemies but merciful towards those with special artistic abilities, sparing the lives of artists, craftsmen and architects so that he could bring them to improve and beautify his capital. He was also directly involved in his construction projects and his visions often exceeded the technical abilities of his workers. Furthermore, the city was in a state of constant construction and Timur would often request buildings to be done and redone quickly if he was unsatisfied with the results.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\">{{cite journal|last=Marefat|first=Roya|title=The Heavenly City of Samarkand|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|date=Summer 1992|volume=16|issue=3|pages=33\u201338|jstor=40258334}}</ref> Timur made it so that the city could only be reached by roads and also ordered the construction of deep ditches and walls, that would run {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip|0}} in circumference, separating the city from the rest of its surrounding neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Roads: two thousand ears in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=Berkeley|pages=136\u20137}}</ref> During this time the city had a population of about 150,000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer'', p. 1657</ref> This great period of reconstruction is encapsulated in the account of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]]'s ambassador, [[Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo]], who was stationed there between 1403 and 1406.

The Russian section of the city was built after this point, largely to the west of the old city.\n\nIn 1886, the city became the capital of the newly formed Samarkand [[Oblast]] of [[Russian Turkestan]] and grew in importance still further when the [[Trans-Caspian railway]] reached the city in 1888.\n \nIt became the capital of the [[Uzbek SSR]] in 1925, before being replaced by [[Tashkent]] in 1930.

As explained by [[Paul Bergne]]:\n<blockquote>During the census of 1926 a significant part of the Tajik population was registered as Uzbek. Thus, for example, in the 1920 census in Samarkand city the Tajiks were recorded as numbering 44,758 and the Uzbeks only 3301. According to the 1926 census, the number of Uzbeks was recorded as 43,364 and the Tajiks as only 10,716. In a series of kishlaks [villages] in the Khojand Okrug, whose population was registered as Tajik in 1920 e.g. in Asht, Kalacha, Akjar i Tajik and others, in the 1926 census they were registered as Uzbeks.

The population of the Samarqand Vilayat is more than 3,720,000 people (2019). There are no exact data on the number of Shiites in the city of Samarqand. Samarqand Vilayat is one of the two regions of Uzbekistan (along with [[Buxoro Region|Bukhara Vilayat]]), where a large number of Shiites live. In other regions of Uzbekistan there are few Shiites.

Every year, Shiites of Samarkand celebrate [[Ashura]], as well as other memorable dates and holidays of Shiites. The total number of followers of Shiism in Uzbekistan is not officially announced, but is estimated at \"several hundred thousand.\" According to [[WikiLeaks]], in 2007-2008, the [[United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom|US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom]] held a series of meetings with Sunni [[mullah]]s and Shiite [[imam]]s in Uzbekistan. During one of the talks, the Imam of the Shiite mosque in [[Bukhara]] said that about 300 thousand Shiites live in the Bukhara Vliayat and another million in the Samarqand Vilayat. The Ambassador slightly doubted the authenticity of these figures, emphasizing in his report that the data on the number of religious and ethnic minorities by the government of Uzbekistan are considered to be a very \"delicate topic\" in order not to provoke interethnic and inter-religious contradictions. All the ambassadors of the ambassador tried to emphasize that traditional Islam, especially [[Sufism]] and [[Sunnism]] in the regions of Bukhara and Samarqand, is characterized by great religious tolerance and tolerance towards other religious movements, including Shiites<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamsng.com/uzb/pastfuture/5570|title=\u0428\u0438\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435|work=www.islamsng.com|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.kz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1545:2013-11-29-08-08-10&catid=2:2011-10-23-11-43-45&Itemid=17|title=\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043e\u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0448\u0438\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432|work=www.dn.kz|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://catoday.org/centrasia/uzbekistan-irancy-shiity-stalkivayutsya-c-problemami-s-pravoohranitelnymi-organami-iran|title=\u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d: \u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b-\u0448\u0438\u0438\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438|work=catoday.org|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nShiites in Samarqand are mostly [[:ru:\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b|Samarqandian Iranians]], who call themselves ''Irani''.

At that time, Samarkand became one of the centers of [[Nestorianism]] in [[Central Asia]].<ref>Dickens, Mark \"Nestorian Christianity in Central Asia. p. 17</ref> Several Nestorian temples were built, which have not survived to this day. The remains of these temples were found by archeologists in the ancient site [[Afrasiyab (Samarkand)|Afrasiyab]] and on the outskirts of Samarkand. At that time, the majority of the population of Samarkand were [[Zoroastrians]], but since Samarkand was the crossroads of caravans between [[History of China|China]], [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Europe]], this city was religiously tolerant. Thus, [[Christianity]] appeared in Samarkand long before the penetration of [[Islam]] into Central Asia. After the penetration of Islam into Central Asia ([[Umayyad Caliphate]]), the Zoroastrians and Nestorians were destroyed by the [[Arabs|Arab]] conquerors, the rest fled to other places, or converted to Islam.\n\nIn 1329-1359 the [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f (\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f)|Samarkand eparchy]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] existed in Samarkand, and several thousand Catholics lived in the city. According to [[Marco Polo]] and Johann Elemosina, a descendant of [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatai Khan]], the founder of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatai dynasty]], [[Eljigidey]] converted to Christianity and was baptized. With the assistance of Eljigidey, the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist was built in Samarkand. After a while Islam completely supplanted Catholicism.\n\nChristianity reappeared in Samarkand several centuries later, from the mid-19th century. Orthodoxy appeared in Samarkand in 1868, after the seizure of Samarkand by the [[Russian Empire]]. In the late 19th century, several churches and temples were built, in the early 20th century, several more Orthodox cathedrals, churches and temples were built, most of which were demolished during the [[USSR]].\n\n==== Now ====\nThe second largest religious group in Samarkand after [[Islam]] is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]].

Eisenhower Library, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. Fols. 359v-36or.]]\n\nTimur initiated the building of Bibi Khanum after his campaign in India in 1398\u20131399. Before its reconstruction after an earthquake in 1897, Bibi Khanum had around 450 marble columns that were established with the help of 95 elephants that Timur had brought back from Hindustan. Also from India, artisans and stonemasons designed the mosque's dome, giving it its distinctiveness amongst the other buildings.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe best-known structure in Samarkand is the mausoleum known as Gur-i Amir. It exhibits many cultures and influences from past civilizations, neighboring peoples, and especially those of Islam. Despite how much devastation the Mongols caused in the past to all of the Islamic architecture that had existed in the city prior to Timur's succession, much of the destroyed Islamic influences were revived, recreated, and restored under Timur. The blueprint and layout of the mosque itself follows the Islamic passion of geometry and other elements of the structure had been precisely measured. The entrance to the Gur-i Amir is decorated with Arabic calligraphy and inscriptions, the latter being a common feature in Islamic architecture. The attention to detail and meticulous nature of Timur is especially obvious when looking inside the building. Inside, the walls have been covered in tiles through a technique, originally developed in Iran, called \"mosaic faience,\" a process where each tile is cut, colored, and fit into place individually.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>  The tiles were also arranged in a specific way that would engrave words relating to the city's religiosity; words like \"Muhammad\" and \"Allah\" have been spelled out on the walls using the tiles.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe ornaments and decorations of the walls include floral and vegetal symbols which are used to signify gardens. Gardens are commonly interpreted as paradise in the Islamic religion and they were both inscribed in tomb walls and grown in the city itself.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/> In the city of Samarkand, there were two major gardens, the New Garden and the Garden of Heart's Delight, and these became the central areas of entertainment for ambassadors and important guests. A friend of Genghis Khan in 1218 named Yel\u00fc Chucai, reported that Samarkand was the most beautiful city of all where \"it was surrounded by numerous gardens. Every household had a garden, and all the gardens were well designed, with canals and water fountains that supplied water to round or square-shaped ponds. The landscape included rows of willows and cypress trees, and peach and plum orchards were shoulder to shoulder.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Xinru|title=The Silk Road in world history|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-516174-8}}</ref> The floors of the mausoleum are entirely covered with uninterrupted patterns of tiles of flowers, emphasizing the presence of Islam and Islamic art in the city. In addition, Persian carpets with floral printings have been found in some of the Timurid buildings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Wiener|first=Ernst|title=An Unknown Timurid Building|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date=June 1935|volume=66|issue=387|pages=272\u2013273+277|jstor=866154}}</ref>\n\nTurko-Mongol influence is also apparent in the architecture of the buildings in Samarkand. For instance, nomads previously used ''[[yurt]]s'', traditional Mongol tents, to display the bodies of the dead before they were to engage in proper burial procedures. Similarly, it is believed that the melon-shaped domes of the tomb chambers are imitations of those yurts. Timur naturally used stronger materials, like bricks and wood, to establish these tents, but their purposes remain largely unchanged.<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/>\n\nThe elements of traditional Islamic architecture can be seen in traditional Uzbek houses that are built around central courtyards with gardens.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/|title=Samarkand  \u2013 Crossroad of Cultures|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> The houses are built from mud brick and most have painted wooden ceilings and wall decorations. Houses in the west of the city are indicative of European style homes built in 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe color of the buildings in Samarkand also has significant meaning behind it. For instance, blue is the most common and dominant color that will be found on the buildings, which was used by Timur in order to symbolize a large range of ideas. For one, the blue shades seen in the Gur-i Amir are colors of mourning. Blue was the color of mourning in Central Asia at the time, as it is in many cultures even today, so its dominance in the city's mausoleum appears only logical. In addition, blue was also seen as the color that would ward off \"the [[evil eye]]\" in Central Asia and the notion is evident in the number of doors in and around the city that were colored blue during this time. Furthermore, blue was representative of water, which was a particularly rare resource around the Middle East and Central Asia; coloring the walls blue symbolized the wealth of the city.\n\nGold also has a strong presence in the city. Timur's fascination with vaulting explains the excessive use of gold in the Gur-i Amir as well as the use of embroidered gold fabric in both the city and his buildings. The Mongols had great interests in Chinese- and Persian-style golden silk textiles as well as [[nasij]] woven in Iran and Transoxiana. Past Mongol leaders, like Ogodei, built textile workshops in their cities in order to be able to produce gold fabrics themselves.\n\nThere is evidence that Timur tried to preserve his Mongol roots. In the chamber in which his body was laid, \"[[tuq]]s\" were found \u2013 those are poles with horses' tails hanging at the top, which was symbolic of an ancient Turkic tradition where horses, which were valuable commodities, were sacrificed in order to honor the dead,<ref name=\"Marefat 1992 33\u201338\"/> and a cavalry standard type shared by many nomads, up to the Ottoman Turks.\n\n== Transport ==\nPublic transport is developed in Samarkand. [[Municipal bus]] (mostly [[SamAuto]] and [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] buses) is the most common and popular transport in the city. Also in the city since 2017 there are [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0439|several Samarkandian tram lines]] (tram existed in Samarkand also in 1947-1973), mostly Vario LF.S Czech trams. Also, the city very much a city [[taxi]] (mostly [[Chevrolet]] and [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] sedans), which is usually yellow in color. Also in the city a lot of [[taxi]]s, which are usually yellow. Also in the city run the so-called \"[[Marshrutka]]\", which are [[minibuses]] [[Daewoo Damas]] and [[GAZelle]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Beruni street in Samarkand.jpg|Many yellow taxis on the streets of Samarkand\nFile:Hotel in Rudaki and Dahbed Streets in Samarkand.jpg|Taxi and tram on Rudaki Street in Samarkand\nFile:Tram in Samarkand.jpg|Tram in Samarkand\nFile:Beruni and Rudaki Streets in Samarkand.jpg|Beruni and Rudaki Streets in Samarkand\nFile:Mirzo Ulughbek Street in Samarkand 2.jpg|Taxi and bus on Mirzo Ulughbek Avenue in Samarkand\n</gallery>\n\nIn [[Soviet times]], up until 2005, in Samarkand plied also to the [[trolleybus]].

The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike.

Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]].

He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for ''[[The Bellboy and the Playgirls]]'', also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by [[Roger Corman]] and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, ''Nebo zovyot'', which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled ''[[Battle Beyond the Sun]]'', released in 1962.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on ''[[Tower of London (1962 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1962), sound man for ''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) and associate producer of ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" />\n\nWhile on location in Ireland for ''The Young Racers'' in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /> Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\">{{cite web |title=Francis Ford Coppola Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org |publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]] |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |access-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323144840/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> This movie earned critical acclaim; [[Geraldine Page]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]], for her performance. It also earned Coppola his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /><ref name=\"UCLATFT\">[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ \"Profile: Francis Ford Coppola\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716061348/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ |date=July 16, 2014 }}, UCLA School of Theater, Film, and television, Executive Board</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', starring [[Petula Clark]] in her first American film and veteran [[Fred Astaire]]. Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

North]]. This earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] that [[Patton (film)#Opening|the opening scene]] would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |publisher=achievement.org |access-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323144840/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/francis-ford-coppola/#interview |archive-date=March 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{Quotation| I wrote the script of ''Patton''.

And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene.}}\"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Gene |title=Godfather The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola |year=2004 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-2304-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32 32] |chapter=1 Point of Departure|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil |url=https://archive.org/details/godfatherintimat00phil/page/32}}</ref>\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monolog, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monolog has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\n====''The Godfather'' (1972)====\n{{Main|The Godfather}}\nThe release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 |year=1981 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7100-0503-8 |page=215}}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time |access-date=October 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207071514/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm |date=December 7, 2009 }} \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels.

North]]. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike. ''The Godfather'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (shared with [[Mario Puzo]]).\n\n''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\n\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (both 1983), the crime dramas ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), and the horror film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress [[Talia Shire]]; his daughter [[Sofia Coppola]] and granddaughter [[Gia Coppola]] are directors, and the actors [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Nicolas Cage]] are his nephews. Coppola resides in [[Napa, California]].\n\n==Early life==\nCoppola was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, to father [[Carmine Coppola]] (1910\u20131991),<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Carmine Coppola, 80, Conductor And Composer for His Son's Films |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |date=April 27, 1991 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/obituaries/carmine-coppola-80-conductor-and-composer-for-his-son-s-films.html |access-date=February 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230005701/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/obituaries/carmine-coppola-80-conductor-and-composer-for-his-son-s-films.html |archive-date=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> a [[flautist]] with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], and mother [[Italia Coppola]] (n\u00e9e Pennino; 1912\u20132004).

On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> This movie earned critical acclaim; [[Geraldine Page]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]], for her performance.

Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monolog, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monolog has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\n====''The Godfather'' (1972)====\n{{Main|The Godfather}}\nThe release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 |year=1981 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7100-0503-8 |page=215}}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]].

Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

(A film was eventually to be made by [[Clint Eastwood]] in 2011 as ''[[J.

Samara among other [[Scythians|Scythian]] cities is located beyond the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasian mountains]] in the northeast.\n\nOn the [[Christianization]] of the ruling elite of the [[Khazars|Khazar Kaganate]] in the 8th century, archeological investigations in the region of the \u201ccountry\u201d Belendzher in the Caucasus testify . Later, under the onslaught of the Arab troops, the Khazars will move to the north, there will be a massive subsidence on the ground, resulting in a so-called Saltov-Mayak culture, which currently rests at the bottom of the Sulak Hydroelectric Power Plant . Note that such \u201cmini-Atlantis\u201d on the site of the Khazar urban centers were formed on the territory of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] due to the creation of reservoir systems . The funerary complex around Chir-Yurt belongs to three ethnic groups that inhabited the city: [[Alans]] ( catacomb burials ), [[Bulgarians]]( pit burials ), Khazars (kurkan catacombs). In the kurgan section of the cemetery where the Khazars rested, scientists discovered two small churches of the 8th century, which is a clear indication of the Christianization of the ruling elite of the Kaganate before its Judaization at the turn of the 8th \u2014 9th centuries. On the [[Volga region|Middle Volga]] in the steppe valleys of the Samara Luka in the beginning of the 21st century, several burial grounds with sub-burial burials of the turn of the 7th \u2014 8th centuries were investigated, which are similar to the kurgan burials of the Lower Volga and the Don. For example, in one rich burial were found overlays from onions of \u201cKhazar type\u201d. The presence of the Khazars is marked far to the north of the Samara Luka. In the cemetery with a Shilovka (about 100&nbsp;km to the north along the [[Volga River|Volga]]), in a rich burial, in addition to the golden Byzantine solidarity of the 7th century, there were also bone plates with hunting scenes, images of soldiers on the fortress wall, etc. Experts believe that the patterns on the bone plates are close to the images on silver dishes, which were made in one of the Khazar jewelry workshops<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8B#CITEREF%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B6%D1%8C%D0%B52012|title=Middle Voga, 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}.\n\nIn addition to the legend relating to the \u201cKasr\u201d (from the Arabic. \u201cCastle\u201d) Samara, the artists edged the miniature of the city with rivers. At the source of the river Samara (Samur ), which flows into the Volga, the artist placed the image of the only tree on the whole map. From the bottom of the tree flows eastward stream. Near the \"miracle tree\" comment: ''\"Here is a tree from which water flows\"'' (perhaps, we are talking about the tree Betula alba (pendula) - birch and birch sap). The source of this legend we find in the report of Ibn Fadlan, who is part of the embassy of the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadir(908\u2013932) visited Volga Bulgaria in May 922. It can be assumed that this information came to the West from the Arab-Persian world or through Byzantium, or through Sicily, during the reign of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194-1250).\n\nIf we talk about the archaeological evidence of the times of the Golden Horde, then in the Samara area there are two settlement sites that relate to this era: one is 20&nbsp;km below the settlement of Singiley ; another in front of Samara near the village Perevolok . As early as the 19th century, ruins of brick and stone buildings visible above the ground were observed in the area of fortifications, silver and copper coins were encountered, but systematic archaeological research was not conducted there <sup>[9]</sup> .\n\nOn the 1448 plan-plan of the Benedictine monk from the monastery of St. Peter <sup>[[St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg|[en]]]</sup> in Salzburg ( lat.  ''Ordinis Sancti Benedicti de Salisburg'' ) Andreas Walchperger <sup>[[Andreas Walsperger|[en]]]</sup> (born around 1415) on a large river in Eastern Europe is present the toponym '''\u201cSamarchar\u201d''' .\n\nFortified castle, located on the left bank of Edil (Volga) on the 1459 world map, Fra Mauro is called '''Samar''' ( Latin  ''Samar'' ). Samar (a), surrounded by high fortress towers with battlements, between which there are passage gates, is located at the confluence of the \u201cblue river\u201d ( Italian  ''fl [umen] coche su'' ) into the Volga. The name suggests that the waters of the river Samara in the Middle Ages were distinguished by purity and transparency. On this wonderful map of the world, based on the best graphic and written sources available to its creators, you can immediately place accents about the unlawful identification of Samara and Samarkand in foreign historiography for a long time - a legend placed near the city of Samarkand reads: ''\u201cThe Samarkand Kingdom . This Kingdom of Samarkand was ruled by Tamerlane ...'' This glorious city [Samarkand] was decorated with beautiful nobility by the most beautiful buildings, among which the castle was particularly notable for its size and power. The governor of this state was exclusively of that kind from which Tamerlan himself descended \u201d.\n\nAl-Masudi's narrative about the adoption of Judaism in the Khazars during the reign of Kharuna al-Rush\u016bda was based on an even earlier essay, now lost. There are two fragments, which are based on the protograph that has not come down to us. They were incorporated into the composition of the Arab cosmographer Shams ad-dun Muhammad ibn ab\u1ef9 Tqlib ad-Dimashk (1256-1327). It says that at the time of Huruna ar-Rash\u016bda the emperor of the Romans (apparently, it was Nikifor I (ruled in 802\u2013811, since 803, together with his son Stavraki ), expelled the Jews from Byzantium. They moved to Khazaria,''\u201cWhere they found intelligent and pious people, declared their faith to them, and they recognized it as the most correct, joined it, remaining [in this faith] for a while. Then the army fought with them from Khorasan, captured their cities, their country, they [the Khazars] became [their] subjects. Says Ibn al-Athir [an Arab historian who lived in 1160 - 1234 - approx. auth.] also that they converted to Islam in 254 [ on Hijra, i.e. in 868 - approx. auth.]; He points out that the cause of their acceptance of Islam was the military attack of the Turks. So they [the Khazars] asked for help from the people of Khorezm, and they answered: \u201cYou are the infidels, accept Islam, and we will help you.\u201d They accepted Islam, except for their king, and the Khorezmians helped them, and the Turks withdrew from them. After that, they accepted Islam and their king''.\n\nWe also cite information from the essay \"News of Khozars, Burtas, Bulgarians ...\" by an Arab geographer of the early 10th century. Abu 'Al\u016b Ahmed Ibn' Omar, Ibn Ruste (Ibn Dusta), when the top of the Khazar state already accepted Judaism, i.e. roughly from 802/803 to 869/870 :''\u201cThey call their king Isha [Beck - approx. auth.]; their sovereign, Khozar-Hakan. But this last only by the name of the sovereign, the real power belongs to Isha, since he is in a position of this kind with respect to the affairs of command and control of the troops, which gives no account to anyone who would stand above him. The supreme head of them professes the Hebrew faith; of the same faith as Isha, so are the captains and nobles who are with him; the rest of the Khozars profess a religion similar to that of the Turks \u201d'' .\n\n== 16th century ==\nThe foundation of the Samara small town in the Samara natural boundary occurred in 1586 by decree of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich on the bank of the Samara River near its confluence with the Volga under the direction of Prince G. O. Zasekinand the Streletsky heads of the \u201ccomrade\u201d (deputy governor) Yelchaninov and Streshnev. The purpose of the fortress is the protection of shipping on the Middle Volga and the protection of state frontiers from raids by the steppe\n\nThe fortress was built on the territory now occupied by the Samara valve factory, and to the south of it - that is, in the direction of the r. Samara. It was built from May 22 to August 19. Art. (May 9 - August 6, Art. Art.) 1586. The first inhabitants were the serving people: the boyars' children, archers, gunners and collars, who carried the guard service, guarding the new fortress  ''\u201cfrom thieves\u201d''  and from the Nogai attacks .\n\nThe fortress has not survived to this day (it burned down in the fires of 1690 and 1703), however, it was possible to restore its exact dimensions (perimeter 635 m) and location. The Samara fortress of 1586 was a fortification of two parallel log walls, which every 6\u20138 m were joined by transversal walls cut at them at a right angle. The space between the walls (its width could be different, reaching 3 m) was filled with earth and stones. The total thickness of such a fortress wall was about 5 m. The height of the Samara city wall is not known from the documents, but, following the height of the wall in the Volga cities, we can assume that it varied in different areas from 4.5 to 6 m. Samara Fortress had 8 towers, of which 4 were passable, that is, had a gate. The fortress towers are structures with hipped roofs, in terms of square, quadrangular or (at the corners) polygonal, with sides from 4 to 14 m long, usually 8\u201310 m high, with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2\u20133 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns. Some towers did not have a hip roof, but all had clouds (or breaks) - an extended and overhanging upper part, due to which a vertical slot formed between the upper and lower layers of the walls for firing from above to the besiegers. The distance between adjacent towers varied, sometimes differing by half. Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \"boyars' children\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) usually 8\u201310 m high with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2\u20133 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns.

Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \"boyars' children\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) .\n\nProbably already in 1587 (in any case, not later than the beginning of the 1590s), the Samara fortress (or the ''city'' , or the ''Kremlin'' ) was surrounded on 3 sides by a second defensive line - a wall of guard type (1542 m long). ''Ostrog'' (more rarely, ''palisade'' ) is, in fact, a high fence of vertically standing log-piles with a diameter of 25\u201330&nbsp;cm vertically standing close to each other. The height of the wall was 4-4.5 m (according to Laishev, Malmyzh and other fortresses of the Volga region). Samara fortress had 8 towers (probably four-walled <sup>[24]</sup>), and some of them were also passing. The combination of fortress and fort is typical of Russian defense town planning of the 16th \u2014 17th centuries. They are interrelated parts of a single defensive complex, the general plan for the construction of which, apparently, already existed in 1586.\n\nThe topography of the Samara fortress in 1586, the fort, the first cathedral churches of Samara and the church of the first Samara monastery are presented for reconstruction.\n\nThe first image of Samara is widely known in the description and in the engraving by A. Olearius. The Holstein embassy of 1636 sailed past Samara \"even before the rising of the Sun\" and made only a brief stop, after which \"they dismissed the sails and set off further.\" The channel of the Volga at that period was 2 versts from Samara (= 2.1&nbsp;km). That is, the city of A. Olearius observed from afar and under unfavorable light conditions - in the predawn twilight or in the blinding rays of the rising sun in the east. Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on the accuracy of the transfer of A. Olearius to the location of churches and other details. But even in such conditions, the engraving correctly shows the number of towers and churches (except for the southern part of the fortress, which is the farthest from the observer, the worst part of the fortress), a cautious type of wall on the Volga coast is realistically reflected.\n\nDuring the XVII century the city grew and continued to strengthen. By the beginning of 1700, the fortification of Samara included five lines of wooden fortifications: a ''fortress (the Kremlin)'' , a ''fortress'' (two lines), and ''ancholes'' (also two lines, but dilapidated or collapsed). After the devastating fires of 1700 and 1703, a new fortress (the so-called \"earthen\") of 1704-1706 was built in the city. Its remains were discovered during the archaeological excavations of 2013\u20132014 on Khlebnaya Square.\n\n== Later centuries ==\nIn the spring of 1646, the first household census of Samara was carried out with the suburb, the only settlement at that moment - Boldyrskaya - and the county (there is information about the early formation of the nobility around the city of Samara, and previous censuses). Thus, the fortress of Samara had all the rights of the city since its foundation in 1586.\n\nIn 1708 Samara - the ninth city of Kazan province . Since 1719, Samara belongs to the Astrakhan province . Since 1728 Samara once again belongs to the Kazan province . Since 1780, Samara belongs to Simbirsk governorship . Since 1796, Samara belongs to Simbirsk province . In 1851, Samara - the provincial capital and the capital of the Samara province, numbering 15 thousand people. Since then, the city began to flourish; He was known as the \"Russian Chicago\" due to giant mills, numerous small factory, barns. In the city there were 375 trade shops, and the Samara province was the leader in the number of wheat collected in the Russian Empire .

Samara among other [[Scythians|Scythian]] cities is located beyond the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasian mountains]] in the northeast.\n\nOn the [[Christianization]] of the ruling elite of the [[Khazars|Khazar Kaganate]] in the 8th century, archeological investigations in the region of the \u201ccountry\u201d Belendzher in the Caucasus testify . Later, under the onslaught of the Arab troops, the Khazars will move to the north, there will be a massive subsidence on the ground, resulting in a so-called Saltov-Mayak culture , which currently rests at the bottom of the Sulak Hydroelectric Power Plant . Note that such \u201cmini-Atlantis\u201d on the site of the Khazar urban centers were formed on the territory of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] due to the creation of reservoir systems . The funerary complex around Chir-Yurt belongs to three ethnic groups that inhabited the city: [[Alans]] ( catacomb burials ), [[Bulgarians]]( pit burials ), Khazars (kurkan catacombs). In the kurgan section of the cemetery where the Khazars rested, scientists discovered two small churches of the 8th century, which is a clear indication of the Christianization of the ruling elite of the Kaganate before its Judaization at the turn of the 8th \u2014 9th centuries. On the [[Volga region|Middle Volga]] in the steppe valleys of the Samara Luka in the beginning of the 21st century, several burial grounds with sub-burial burials of the turn of the 7th \u2014 8th centuries were investigated, which are similar to the kurgan burials of the Lower Volga and the Don. For example, in one rich burial were found overlays from onions of \u201cKhazar type\u201d. The presence of the Khazars is marked far to the north of the Samara Luka. In the cemetery with a Shilovka (about 100&nbsp;km to the north along the [[Volga River|Volga]]), in a rich burial, in addition to the golden Byzantine solidarity of the 7th century, there were also bone plates with hunting scenes, images of soldiers on the fortress wall, etc. Experts believe that the patterns on the bone plates are close to the images on silver dishes , which were made in one of the Khazar jewelry workshops<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8B#CITEREF%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B6%D1%8C%D0%B52012|title=Middle Voga, 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}.\n\nIn addition to the legend relating to the \u201cKasr\u201d (from the Arabic. \u201cCastle\u201d) Samara, the artists edged the miniature of the city with rivers. At the source of the river Samara (Samur ), which flows into the Volga, the artist placed the image of the only tree on the whole map. From the bottom of the tree flows eastward stream. Near the \"miracle tree\" comment: ''\"Here is a tree from which water flows\"'' (perhaps, we are talking about the tree Betula alba (pendula) - birch and birch sap). The source of this legend we find in the report of Ibn Fadlan , who is part of the embassy of the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadir(908\u2013932) visited Volga Bulgaria in May 922. It can be assumed that this information came to the West from the Arab-Persian world or through Byzantium, or through Sicily , during the reign of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194-1250).\n\nIf we talk about the archaeological evidence of the times of the Golden Horde, then in the Samara area there are two settlement sites that relate to this era: one is 20&nbsp;km below the settlement of Singiley ; another in front of Samara near the village Perevolok . As early as the 19th century, ruins of brick and stone buildings visible above the ground were observed in the area of fortifications, silver and copper coins were encountered, but systematic archaeological research was not conducted there <sup>[9]</sup> .\n\nOn the 1448 plan-plan of the Benedictine monk from the monastery of St. Peter <sup>[[St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg|[en]]]</sup> in Salzburg ( lat.  ''Ordinis Sancti Benedicti de Salisburg'' ) Andreas Walchperger <sup>[[Andreas Walsperger|[en]]]</sup> (born around 1415) on a large river in Eastern Europe is present the toponym '''\u201cSamarchar\u201d''' .\n\nFortified castle, located on the left bank of Edil (Volga) on the 1459 world map, Fra Mauro is called '''Samar''' ( Latin  ''Samar'' ). Samar (a), surrounded by high fortress towers with battlements, between which there are passage gates, is located at the confluence of the \u201cblue river\u201d ( Italian  ''fl [umen] coche su'' ) into the Volga. The name suggests that the waters of the river Samara in the Middle Ages were distinguished by purity and transparency. On this wonderful map of the world, based on the best graphic and written sources available to its creators, you can immediately place accents about the unlawful identification of Samara and Samarkand in foreign historiography for a long time - a legend placed near the city of Samarkand reads: ''\u201cThe Samarkand Kingdom . This Kingdom of Samarkand was ruled by Tamerlane ...'' This glorious city [Samarkand] was decorated with beautiful nobility by the most beautiful buildings, among which the castle was particularly notable for its size and power. The governor of this state was exclusively of that kind from which Tamerlan himself descended \u201d.\n\nAl-Masudi's narrative about the adoption of Judaism in the Khazars during the reign of Kharuna al-Rush\u016bda was based on an even earlier essay, now lost. There are two fragments, which are based on the protograph that has not come down to us. They were incorporated into the composition of the Arab cosmographer Shams ad-dun Muhammad ibn ab\u1ef9 Tqlib ad-Dimashk (1256-1327). It says that at the time of Huruna ar-Rash\u016bda the emperor of the Romans (apparently, it was Nikifor I (ruled in 802-811, since 803, together with his son Stavraki ), expelled the Jews from Byzantium. They moved to Khazaria,''\u201cWhere they found intelligent and pious people, declared their faith to them, and they recognized it as the most correct, joined it, remaining [in this faith] for a while. Then the army fought with them from Khorasan, captured their cities, their country, they [the Khazars] became [their] subjects. Says Ibn al-Athir [an Arab historian who lived in 1160 - 1234 - approx. auth.] also that they converted to Islam in 254 [ on Hijra, i.e. in 868 - approx. auth.]; He points out that the cause of their acceptance of Islam was the military attack of the Turks. So they [the Khazars] asked for help from the people of Khorezm, and they answered: \u201cYou are the infidels, accept Islam, and we will help you.\u201d They accepted Islam, except for their king, and the Khorezmians helped them, and the Turks withdrew from them. After that, they accepted Islam and their king''.\n\nWe also cite information from the essay \"News of Khozars, Burtas, Bulgarians ...\" by an Arab geographer of the early 10th century. Abu 'Al\u016b Ahmed Ibn' Omar, Ibn Ruste (Ibn Dusta), when the top of the Khazar state already accepted Judaism, i.e. roughly from 802/803 to 869/870 :''\u201cThey call their king Isha [Beck - approx. auth.]; their sovereign, Khozar-Hakan. But this last only by the name of the sovereign, the real power belongs to Isha, since he is in a position of this kind with respect to the affairs of command and control of the troops, which gives no account to anyone who would stand above him. The supreme head of them professes the Hebrew faith; of the same faith as Isha, so are the captains and nobles who are with him; the rest of the Khozars profess a religion similar to that of the Turks \u201d'' .\n\n== 16th century ==\nThe foundation of the Samara small town in the Samara natural boundary occurred in 1586 by decree of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich on the bank of the Samara River near its confluence with the Volga under the direction of Prince G. O. Zasekinand the Streletsky heads of the \u201ccomrade\u201d (deputy governor) Yelchaninov and Streshnev. The purpose of the fortress is the protection of shipping on the Middle Volga and the protection of state frontiers from raids by the steppe\n\nThe fortress was built on the territory now occupied by the Samara valve factory, and to the south of it - that is, in the direction of the r. Samara. It was built from May 22 to August 19. Art. (May 9 - August 6, Art. Art.) 1586. The first inhabitants were the serving people: the boyars' children, archers, gunners and collars, who carried the guard service, guarding the new fortress  ''\u201cfrom thieves\u201d''  and from the Nogai attacks .\n\nThe fortress has not survived to this day (it burned down in the fires of 1690 and 1703), however, it was possible to restore its exact dimensions (perimeter 635 m) and location. The Samara fortress of 1586 was a fortification of two parallel log walls, which every 6\u20138 m were joined by transversal walls cut at them at a right angle. The space between the walls (its width could be different, reaching 3 m) was filled with earth and stones. The total thickness of such a fortress wall was about 5 m. The height of the Samara city wall is not known from the documents, but, following the height of the wall in the Volga cities, we can assume that it varied in different areas from 4.5 to 6 m. Samara Fortress had 8 towers, of which 4 were passable, that is, had a gate. The fortress towers are structures with hipped roofs, in terms of square, quadrangular or (at the corners) polygonal, with sides from 4 to 14 m long, usually 8\u201310 m high, with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2\u20133 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns. Some towers did not have a hip roof, but all had clouds (or breaks) - an extended and overhanging upper part, due to which a vertical slot formed between the upper and lower layers of the walls for firing from above to the besiegers. The distance between adjacent towers varied, sometimes differing by half. Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \"boyars' children\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) usually 8\u201310 m high with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2\u20133 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns.

Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \"boyars' children\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) .\n\nProbably already in 1587 (in any case, not later than the beginning of the 1590s), the Samara fortress (or the ''city'' , or the ''Kremlin'' ) was surrounded on 3 sides by a second defensive line - a wall of guard type (1542 m long). ''Ostrog'' (more rarely, ''palisade'' ) is, in fact, a high fence of vertically standing log-piles with a diameter of 25\u201330&nbsp;cm vertically standing close to each other. The height of the wall was 4-4.5 m (according to Laishev, Malmyzh and other fortresses of the Volga region). Samara fortress had 8 towers (probably four-walled <sup>[24]</sup>), and some of them were also passing. The combination of fortress and fort is typical of Russian defense town planning of the 16th \u2014 17th centuries. They are interrelated parts of a single defensive complex, the general plan for the construction of which, apparently, already existed in 1586.\n\nThe topography of the Samara fortress in 1586, the fort, the first cathedral churches of Samara and the church of the first Samara monastery are presented for reconstruction.\n\nThe first image of Samara is widely known in the description and in the engraving by A. Olearius. The Holstein embassy of 1636 sailed past Samara \"even before the rising of the Sun\" and made only a brief stop, after which \"they dismissed the sails and set off further.\" The channel of the Volga at that period was 2 versts from Samara (= 2.1&nbsp;km). That is, the city of A. Olearius observed from afar and under unfavorable light conditions - in the predawn twilight or in the blinding rays of the rising sun in the east. Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on the accuracy of the transfer of A. Olearius to the location of churches and other details. But even in such conditions, the engraving correctly shows the number of towers and churches (except for the southern part of the fortress, which is the farthest from the observer, the worst part of the fortress), a cautious type of wall on the Volga coast is realistically reflected.\n\nDuring the XVII century the city grew and continued to strengthen. By the beginning of 1700, the fortification of Samara included five lines of wooden fortifications: a ''fortress (the Kremlin)'' , a ''fortress'' (two lines), and ''ancholes'' (also two lines, but dilapidated or collapsed). After the devastating fires of 1700 and 1703, a new fortress (the so-called \"earthen\") of 1704-1706 was built in the city. Its remains were discovered during the archaeological excavations of 2013\u20132014 on Khlebnaya Square.\n\n== Later centuries ==\nIn the spring of 1646, the first household census of Samara was carried out with the suburb, the only settlement at that moment - Boldyrskaya - and the county (there is information about the early formation of the nobility around the city of Samara, and previous censuses). Thus, the fortress of Samara had all the rights of the city since its foundation in 1586.\n\nIn 1708 Samara - the ninth city of Kazan province . Since 1719, Samara belongs to the Astrakhan province . Since 1728 Samara once again belongs to the Kazan province . Since 1780, Samara belongs to Simbirsk governorship . Since 1796, Samara belongs to Simbirsk province . In 1851, Samara - the provincial capital and the capital of the Samara province , numbering 15 thousand people. Since then, the city began to flourish; He was known as the \"Russian Chicago\" due to giant mills , numerous small factory , barns. In the city there were 375 trade shops, and the Samara province was the leader in the number of wheat collected in the Russian Empire . Since 1928, Samara becomes the center of the Middle Volga region . Since 1929, Samara is the center of the Middle Volga region . In 1935, Samara was renamed Kuibyshev, part of the Kuibyshev region . Since 1936, Kuibyshev (Samara) is the center of the Kuibyshev region . In 1990, Samara returned the historical name, the city is the center of the Samara Oblast.\n\n== Modern period ==\nOn June 8, 1918, deputies of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly formed in Samara a government independent of the Bolshevik government . It was called the  Committee of the Members of the Constituent Assembly (Comouch).

'''{{PH wikidata|official_name}}''' ({{lang-tl|Pulong Harding Lungsod ng Samal}}, {{lang-ceb|Pulong Harding Dakbayan sa Samal}}) or sometimes called '''IGaCOS''', is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} \n\nIt is made up of Samal Island and the smaller Talikud Island in the [[Davao Gulf]], from the merger of former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian.\n\nSamal is a part of the [[Metro Davao|Metropolitan Davao]] area and is two kilometers away from [[Davao City]], the largest city and the primary economic center of Mindanao.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Samal was derived from the [[Sama-Bajau peoples]], the natives who were the first inhabitants of the island. The first [[datu]] in the island was Datu Taganiyug, a native of what is now Pe\u00f1aplata, today the governance center of the city. In the past, the people of the island name a place about what was the said place known for. For example, the name ''Pe&#241;aplata'' is said to be derived from the word \"pi&#241;a\" or pineapple because of the abundance of pineapple in the area; this, however, is [[folk etymology]], for ''pe&#241;aplata'' literally means \"rock of silver\" in [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]. Tagpopongan is the first barangay in the island which name was from the word \"tagpo\" or meet. It was so called owing to the fact that this place was chosen by the datus as their meeting place. The word Samal was also known before because it was commonly used as surname by datus.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Beginnings===\nThe island was initially home to the Sama-Bajau peoples. Later on, Spain managed to conquer the island in the late 1840s when Nueva Vergara (Davao City today) was established.\n\n===World War 2===\nThe [[Pacific War]], which happened during [[World War II]], struck the island. Japanese fighter planes bombed the island. Japanese forces occupied the island and forced the people to work for four years until they were expelled by the Allied forces. After the war, infrastructure was built, like [[schools]], [[church (building)|churches]] and stores in the area.\n\n===Official founding of the municipality===\nThe time came in July 8, 1948, when the entire island itself becomes part of the newly created municipality of Samal;<ref>per Executive Order No. 151, s. 1948</ref> it was the official founding of the municipality. Five years later in 1953, the municipality of Babak was created from Samal,<ref>per Executive Order No. 596, s. 1953</ref> marking the political division of the island between the two municipalities. Now came the political division of the island between the three municipalities, when the municipality of Kaputian was created from the island in 1966.<ref>per Republic Act No. 4754 of June 18, 1966</ref> In this period, the living qualities between these three municipalities became low and extremely rural.\n\n===Proposed province===\nIn 1969, a proposal to create the sub-province of Samal was created by Republic Act No. 5999<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno5999.html |title=Republic Act No. 5999 |website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library}}</ref> and covered the area of the present-day city. The act was enacted without President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' approval. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated.\n\n===City conversion===\nThe city was created through Republic Act No. 8471 in January 30, 1998. This act paved the way for the dissolution and merger of the three former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian into one local government unit by turning then into districts, now officially named as IGaCoS, the Island Garden City of Samal. The first city mayor was Rogelio P. Antalan, who later served for three consecutive terms from 1998 to 2007.\n\n===Hostage crisis===\nOn September 22, 2015, Kjartan Sekkingstad, aged 55, from [[Sotra]], Norway, was [[Abu Sayyaf#2015 Samal Island kidnappings|abducted by Abu Sayyaf Islamist guerrillas]] from a high-end tourist resort on Samal Island, along with two Canadian men, [[John Ridsdel]], aged 68, and [[Robert Hall (Canadian)|Robert Hall]], aged 67, and a Filipina woman, Marites Flor, Hall's girlfriend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mogato |first1=Manuel |title=Gunmen abduct three foreign tourists from southern Philippines resort |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-kidnapping/gunmen-abduct-three-foreign-tourists-from-southern-philippines-resort-idUSKCN0RM03220150922 |website=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=12 October 2017 |date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> In April and June 2016, the Canadians were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, and in June 2016 Flor was released. On September 17, 2016, Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island, 600 miles south of Manila after captor Abu Sayyaf received $638,000 in ransom for his release. He was handed over to another rebel group, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]]. The MNLF was in peace talks with the government and had been working with authorities to secure Sekkingstad's release. It is not known who paid the ransom for Sekkingstad, but it was not Norwegian authorities.<ref>http://norwaytoday.info/news/abu-sayyaf-released-sekkingstad/</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Babakbaywalk.jpg|thumb|right|Baywalk in Babak District, Samal Island]]\nSamal is the only city in the country that encompasses two entire islands, hence its name as the Island Garden City. While pristine beaches dot the island's shores, hills dominate the middle portions of the island. Talikud Island is located southwest of the main island. \n\nIGaCoS enjoys an evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year and a typhoon free climate, which make it ideal for agricultural production. \n\n===Barangays===\nSamal is politically subdivided into 46 [[barangay]]s. In 1955, the sitios of Mambago, San Isidro, Santo Ni\u00f1o, San Antonio, San Agustin, Dangcaan, Balet, Tambo, Camudmud, and Cogon were converted into barrios of the now-defunct municipality of Babak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1307.html|title=An Act Converting Certain Sitios in the Municipality of Babak, Province of Davao, into Barrios|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* Adecor\n* Anonang\n* Aumbay\n* Aundanao\n* Balet\n* Bandera\n* Caliclic (Dangca-an)\n* Camudmud\n* Catagman\n* Cawag\n* Cogon\n* Cogon (Talicod)\n* Dadatan\n* Del Monte\n* Guilon\n* Kanaan\n* Kinawitnon\n* Libertad\n* Libuak\n* Licup\n* Limao\n* Linosutan\n* Mambago-A\n* Mambago-B\n* Miranda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Moncado ([[Poblacion]])\n* Pangubatan\n* Pe\u00f1aplata ([[Poblacion]])\n* Poblacion (Kaputian)\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Isidro (Babak)\n* San Isidro (Kaputian)\n* San Jose (San Lapuz)\n* San Miguel (Magamomo)\n* San Remigio\n* Santa Cruz (Talicod II)\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Sion (Zion)\n* Tagbaobo\n* Tagbay\n* Tagbitan-ag\n* Tagdaliao\n* Tagpopongan\n* Tambo\n* Toril\n* Villarica\n}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Samal, Davao del Norte\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Jan low C  = 22\n| Feb high C = 30\n| Feb low C  = 22\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Mar low C  = 22\n| Apr high C = 30\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 23\n| Jun high C = 31\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 30\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 30\n| Aug low C  = 24\n| Sep high C = 30\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 30\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 30\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 98\n| Feb precipitation mm = 86\n| Mar precipitation mm = 91\n| Apr precipitation mm = 83\n| May precipitation mm = 133\n| Jun precipitation mm = 158\n| Jul precipitation mm = 111\n| Aug precipitation mm = 101\n| Sep precipitation mm = 94\n| Oct precipitation mm = 117\n| Nov precipitation mm = 131\n| Dec precipitation mm = 94\n| Jan rain days        = 16.4\n| Feb rain days        = 14.3\n| Mar rain days        = 16.3\n| Apr rain days        = 18.5\n| May rain days        = 25.3\n| Jun rain days        = 25.0\n| Jul rain days        = 23.8\n| Aug rain days        = 21.9\n| Sep rain days        = 20.8\n| Oct rain days        = 24.4\n| Nov rain days        = 24.3\n| Dec rain days        = 18.7\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/samal_philippines_1690666\n| title =  Samal: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Samal\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = 1956\n| 1939 = 7473\n| 1948 = 20334\n| 1960 = 36161\n| 1970 = 50839\n| 1975 = 56144\n| 1980 = 62423\n| 1990 = 69640\n| 1995 = 76995\n| 2000 = 82609\n| 2007 = 90291\n| 2010 = 95874\n| 2015 = 104123\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nCebuano is the medium of language of the people of Samal Island, followed by Isama, Boholano and Tausug.\n\n==Economy==\n===Agriculture===\nThe city's economy depends greatly in its agricultural production.

Because of these, the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] named it one of the best visiting islands in [[Mindanao]] and currently one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the country. Thus, tourism is the main source of income in the city. Biggest taxes are imposed to tourism and resort industry.\n[[File:Bigiw boats in Samal Island.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bigiw]]'' sailboats in Samal Island]]\n\nThere are three main festivals held annually in the city, namely: \n*Kabasan Festival, coincides with the founding of Babak municipality every year in May, features bikini open contests, fireworks display, street-dancing and street parties, and [[motocross]] events\n*White Nights Festival, takes place every two days with Kaputian as the venue, celebrating the city's cultural and historical heritage; and\n*Hugyaw Madayaw Festival, a spin-off of Davao's [[Kadayawan Festival]] which is also held annually in August, and also an attempt to preserve the diminishing Sama culture in the island.\n\n[[Monfort Bat Sanctuary]], the world's largest fruit bat colony,<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest colony of Geoffrey's Rousette Fruit Bat (Rousetteus amplexicaudatus)|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/8000/largest-colony-of-geoffreys-rousette-fruit-bat-%28rousetteus-amplexicaudatus%29|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=December 7, 2012|quote=The Monfort Bat Colony, located in the Monfort Cave on the Samal Island in Mindanao, Philippines, is the largest colony of Geoffrey\u2019s Rousette Fruit Bat (Rousetteus amplexicaudatus)\u201d.

The city has no both container port and deep-water transport terminal, except for a barge wharf at Babak district, to deliver market products directly to the city, so the city government advocated building fishery complexes across the city to minimize the demand for market products imported to the city. Fish, pearls, and [[crustaceans#Consumption by humans|edible crustaceans]] such as shrimps, prawns, and crabs are the main aquatic consumable products in the city.\n\n==Government==\nThe center of city governance is located at Barangay Pe\u00f1aplata, Samal District, situated at the west central coast of the island. The city has three districts: Babak, Samal and Kaputian. These districts used to serve as separate towns until the 1998 city merger.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Babakstreet.jpg|thumb|right|Samal Circumferential Road in Babak District, Samal Island]]\n[[roll-on/roll-off|Barge/ferry service]] or passenger boats from the [[Port of Davao|Sasa Wharf & Santa Ana Wharf]] in Davao City serves the island city.

wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} \n\nIt is made up of Samal Island and the smaller Talikud Island in the [[Davao Gulf]], from the merger of former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian.\n\nSamal is a part of the [[Metro Davao|Metropolitan Davao]] area and is two kilometers away from [[Davao City]], the largest city and the primary economic center of Mindanao.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Samal was derived from the [[Sama-Bajau peoples]], the natives who were the first inhabitants of the island. The first [[datu]] in the island was Datu Taganiyug, a native of what is now Pe\u00f1aplata, today the governance center of the city. In the past, the people of the island name a place about what was the said place known for. For example, the name ''Pe&#241;aplata'' is said to be derived from the word \"pi&#241;a\" or pineapple because of the abundance of pineapple in the area; this, however, is [[folk etymology]], for ''pe&#241;aplata'' literally means \"rock of silver\" in [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]. Tagpopongan is the first barangay in the island which name was from the word \"tagpo\" or meet. It was so called owing to the fact that this place was chosen by the datus as their meeting place. The word Samal was also known before because it was commonly used as surname by datus.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Beginnings===\nThe island was initially home to the Sama-Bajau peoples. Later on, Spain managed to conquer the island in the late 1840s when Nueva Vergara (Davao City today) was established.\n\n===World War 2===\nThe [[Pacific War]], which happened during [[World War II]], struck the island. Japanese fighter planes bombed the island. Japanese forces occupied the island and forced the people to work for four years until they were expelled by the Allied forces. After the war, infrastructure was built, like [[schools]], [[church (building)|churches]] and stores in the area.\n\n===Official founding of the municipality===\nThe time came in July 8, 1948, when the entire island itself becomes part of the newly created municipality of Samal;<ref>per Executive Order No. 151, s. 1948</ref> it was the official founding of the municipality. Five years later in 1953, the municipality of Babak was created from Samal,<ref>per Executive Order No. 596, s. 1953</ref> marking the political division of the island between the two municipalities. Now came the political division of the island between the three municipalities, when the municipality of Kaputian was created from the island in 1966.<ref>per Republic Act No. 4754 of June 18, 1966</ref> In this period, the living qualities between these three municipalities became low and extremely rural.\n\n===Proposed province===\nIn 1969, a proposal to create the sub-province of Samal was created by Republic Act No. 5999<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno5999.html |title=Republic Act No. 5999 |website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library}}</ref> and covered the area of the present-day city. The act was enacted without President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' approval. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated.\n\n===City conversion===\nThe city was created through Republic Act No. 8471 in January 30, 1998. This act paved the way for the dissolution and merger of the three former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian into one local government unit by turning then into districts, now officially named as IGaCoS, the Island Garden City of Samal. The first city mayor was Rogelio P. Antalan, who later served for three consecutive terms from 1998 to 2007.\n\n===Hostage crisis===\nOn September 22, 2015, Kjartan Sekkingstad, aged 55, from [[Sotra]], Norway, was [[Abu Sayyaf#2015 Samal Island kidnappings|abducted by Abu Sayyaf Islamist guerrillas]] from a high-end tourist resort on Samal Island, along with two Canadian men, [[John Ridsdel]], aged 68, and [[Robert Hall (Canadian)|Robert Hall]], aged 67, and a Filipina woman, Marites Flor, Hall\u2019s girlfriend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mogato |first1=Manuel |title=Gunmen abduct three foreign tourists from southern Philippines resort |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-kidnapping/gunmen-abduct-three-foreign-tourists-from-southern-philippines-resort-idUSKCN0RM03220150922 |website=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=12 October 2017 |date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> In April and June 2016, the Canadians were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, and in June 2016 Flor was released. On September 17, 2016, Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island, 600 miles south of Manila after captor Abu Sayyaf received $638,000 in ransom for his release. He was handed over to another rebel group, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]]. The MNLF was in peace talks with the government and had been working with authorities to secure Sekkingstad's release. It is not known who paid the ransom for Sekkingstad, but it was not Norwegian authorities.<ref>http://norwaytoday.info/news/abu-sayyaf-released-sekkingstad/</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Babakbaywalk.jpg|thumb|right|Baywalk in Babak District, Samal Island]]\nSamal is the only city in the country that encompasses two entire islands, hence its name as the Island Garden City. While pristine beaches dot the island's shores, hills dominate the middle portions of the island. Talikud Island is located southwest of the main island. \n\nIGaCoS enjoys an evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year and a typhoon free climate, which make it ideal for agricultural production. \n\n===Barangays===\nSamal is politically subdivided into 46 [[barangay]]s.

The city has no both container port and deep-water transport terminal, except for a barge wharf at Babak district, to deliver market products directly to the city, so the city government advocated building fishery complexes across the city to minimize the demand for market products imported to the city. Fish, pearls, and [[crustaceans#Consumption by humans|edible crustaceans]] such as shrimps, prawns, and crabs are the main aquatic consumable products in the city.\n\n==Government==\nThe center of city governance is located at Barangay Pe\u00f1aplata, Samal District, situated at the west central coast of the island.
