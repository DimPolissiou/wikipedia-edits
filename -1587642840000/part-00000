They were invaded by [[Gaels]] from Ireland starting perhaps in the 4th century or earlier, whose language eventually predominated. In the 8th and 9th centuries this area, like others, suffered raids and invasions by Vikings from [[Norway]], and the islands became known to the Gaels as ''Innse-Gall'', the Islands of the Foreigners. Around 875, Norwegian jarls, or princes, came to these islands to avoid losing their independence in the course of King [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]]'s unification of [[Norway]], but Harald pursued them and conquered the [[Hebrides]] as well as [[Isle of Man|Man]], and the [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney Islands]]. The following year, the people of the Isles, both Gael and Norse, rebelled. Harald sent his cousin [[Ketill Flatnose]] to regain control, and Ketil then became [[Rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Isles]]. Scotland and Norway would continue to dispute overlordship of the area, with the jarls of Orkney at times seeing themselves as independent rulers.\n\nIn 973, [[Maccus mac Arailt]], King of the Isles, [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Kenneth III]], King of the Scots, and [[M\u00e1el Coluim I of Strathclyde]] formed a defensive alliance, but subsequently the Scandinavians defeated Gilla Adomn\u00e1in of the Isles and expelled him to Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Norse nobleman [[Godred Crovan]] became ruler of Man and the Isles, but he was deposed in 1095 by the new King of Norway, [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Bareleg]]. In 1098, Magnus entered into a treaty with King [[Edgar of Scotland]], intended as a demarcation of their respective areas of authority. Magnus was confirmed in control of the Isles and Edgar of the mainland. Lavery cites a tale from the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', according to which King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] offered Earl Magnus of Orkney all the islands off the west coast navigable with the rudder set. Magnus then allegedly had a skiff hauled across the neck of land at [[Tarbert, Kintyre|Tarbert]], [[Loch Fyne]] with himself at the helm, thus including the Kintyre peninsula in the Isles' sphere of influence. (The date given falls after the end of Malcolm's reign in 1093.)\n\n===Founding of the dynasties===\n[[Somerled]], Gilledomman's grandson, seized the Isles (i.e. everything except the Isle of Man & Skye) from the King of Man in 1156 and founded a dynasty that in time became the ''Lords of the Isles''. He had Celtic blood on his father's side and Norse on his mother's: his contemporaries knew him as ''Somerled Macgilbred'', ''Somhairle'' or in Norse ''Sumarlidi H\u00f6ld'' ('Somerled' means \"summer wanderer\", the name given to the Vikings). He took the title ''[[R\u00ed]] Innse Gall'' (King of the Hebrides) as well as ''[[King of Mann]]''.\n\nAfter Somerled's death in 1164, three of his sons, and his brother-in-law (the King of Man), divided his realm between them:\n* The King of Man : Man, [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Harris, Scotland|Harris]], and [[Skye]]\n* The sons of Somerled :\n** [[Aonghus mac Somhairle|Angus]] : unclear area, perhaps the remaining northern regions\n** [[Dubgall mac Somairle|Dougall]] (ancestor of [[Clan MacDougall]]) : [[Morvern]], [[Ardnamurchan]], and [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]\n** [[Ragnall mac Somairle|Ronald]] : unclear area, perhaps the southern regions\n\nFor reasons which are now unclear, Ronald's sons seem to have taken over the territory of both him and Angus, splitting it between them:\n*[[Domhnall mac Raghnaill|Donald Mor McRanald]], who would give his name to the [[Clan Donald]] (which would contest territory with the MacDougalls) : [[Islay]], [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], [[Kintyre]], [[Knapdale]]\n*[[Ruaidhr\u00ed mac Raghnaill|Rory]] (ancestor of [[Clan Macruari]]) : [[Uist]], [[Garmoran]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]]\n\n==The MacDonald lordship==\n[[File:MacDonald of the Isles (MacIan).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clan Donald|MacDonald]], Lord of the Isles \u2013 a [[R.

From the 14th century they changed from using a steering oar to a stern rudder. These ships took part in sea battles and attacked castles or forts built close to the sea.

Then in 1462, [[John MacDonald II]] Lord of the Isles signed a treaty with [[Edward IV of England]] to conquer Scotland with him and the Earl of Douglas. The treaty between Edward IV and MacDonald II has been used to show how the MacDonald Lords were viewed as independent rulers of their kingdom, freely entering into national and military treaties with foreign governments. Unfortunately for the MacDonald sovereigns, the civil war in England, known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], prevented the completion of the alliance between Edward IV and MacDonald II. Upon the discovery of his alliance with Edward IV in 1493, MacDonald II had his ancestral lands, estates, and titles taken from him by [[James IV of Scotland]]. In addition to James IV seeking revenge on MacDonald II, he possessed a larger military force and was able to impose his will on the West Coast of Scotland, though uprisings and rebellions were common. Though the Lordship was taken away from the MacDonald family in the 15th century, waves of successive MacDonald leaders have contested this and fought for its revival ever since, notably during [[Dubh's Rebellion]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Since then, the eldest male child of the reigning Scottish (and later, British) monarch has been styled \"Lord of the Isles\", essentially merging the crowns of Dal Riada with the Pictish East of Scotland. The office itself has been extinct since the 15th century and the style since then has no other meaning but to recall the Scottish seizure of the ancient Norse-Gaelic lordship and crown. Currently [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] is titular Lord of the Isles, as well as [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]] and [[High Steward of Scotland]]. \n\n==See also==\n*[[Lord of Islay]]\n*[[Kingdom of the Isles]]\n*[[Domhnall Dubh|Donald Dubh]]\n*[[Battle of Harlaw]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bannerman, J., ''The Lordship of the Isles'', in Scottish Society in the Fifteenth Century, ed.

A commission granted in July 1545 by [[Domhnall Dubh]], claimant to the Lordship, identified the following members:\n* [[Hector Mor Maclean, 12th Chief|Hector Maclean of Duart]]\n* John [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|Macdonald of Clanranald]]\n* Ruari [[Clan MacLeod of Lewis|Macleod of the Lewes]]\n* [[Alasdair Crotach MacLeod|Alexander Macleod of Dunvegan]]\n* Murdoch [[Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie|Maclaine of Lochbuie]]\n* [[Ailean Maclean|Allan Maclean of Torloisk]]\n* Archibald Macdonald, Captain of [[Clan Macdonald of Sleat|Clann Uisdein]]\n* Alexander [[MacDonald of Ardnamurchan|MacIan of Ardnamurchan]]\n* John Maclean of [[Coll]]\n* Gilleonan [[Clan MacNeil|MacNeil of Barra]]\n* Ewen [[Clan Mackinnon|Mackinnon of Strath]]\n* John [[Clan MacQuarrie|MacQuarrie of Ulva]]\n* [[Maclean of Ardgour|John Maclean of Ardgour]]\n* Alexander [[Clan MacDonell of Glengarry|Macdonell of Glengarry]]\n* Angus Macdonald of [[Knoydart]]\n* Donald Maclean of [[Glensanda|Kingairloch]]\n* Angus Macdonald, brother of James [[Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg|Macdonald of Dunnyveg]].<ref>[[Donald Gregory]], ''History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland from AD 1493 to AD 1625'' (William Tait, Edinburgh, 1836), at page 170</ref>\n\n==End of the MacDonald lordship==\nSuccessive Lords of the Isles fiercely asserted their independence from Scotland, acting as kings of their territories well into the 15th century. Then in 1462, [[John MacDonald II]] Lord of the Isles signed a treaty with [[Edward IV of England]] to conquer Scotland with him and the Earl of Douglas. The treaty between Edward IV and MacDonald II has been used to show how the MacDonald Lords were viewed as independent rulers of their kingdom, freely entering into national and military treaties with foreign governments. Unfortunately for the MacDonald sovereigns, the civil war in England, known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], prevented the completion of the alliance between Edward IV and MacDonald II. Upon the discovery of his alliance with Edward IV in 1493, MacDonald II had his ancestral lands, estates, and titles taken from him by [[James IV of Scotland]]. In addition to James IV seeking revenge on MacDonald II, he possessed a larger military force and was able to impose his will on the West Coast of Scotland, though uprisings and rebellions were common. Though the Lordship was taken away from the MacDonald family in the 15th century, waves of successive MacDonald leaders have contested this and fought for its revival ever since, notably during [[Dubh's Rebellion]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Since then, the eldest male child of the reigning Scottish (and later, British) monarch has been styled \"Lord of the Isles\", essentially merging the crowns of Dal Riada with the Pictish East of Scotland. The office itself has been extinct since the 15th century and the style since then has no other meaning but to recall the Scottish seizure of the ancient Norse-Gaelic lordship and crown. Currently [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] is titular Lord of the Isles, as well as [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]] and [[High Steward of Scotland]]. \n\n==See also==\n*[[Lord of Islay]]\n*[[Kingdom of the Isles]]\n*[[Domhnall Dubh|Donald Dubh]]\n*[[Battle of Harlaw]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bannerman, J., ''The Lordship of the Isles'', in Scottish Society in the Fifteenth Century, ed.

ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the [[foreign minister]]s of five countries: \n[[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Thailand]], signed the [[ASEAN Declaration]]. As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP).

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the [[foreign minister]]s of five countries: \n[[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Thailand]], signed the [[ASEAN Declaration]]. As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

Masilamani and Peterson summarize it as \"a working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilize compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritizes a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view.

Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination.

The Vision was adopted at the 27th Summit on November 2015 in Kuala Lumpur. The ASEAN community would revise and renew its vision every ten years to provide a framework for continuous development and further integration. The terms in the Vision are divided into four subcategories, namely APSC, AEC, ASCC, and Moving Forward. APSC issues are covered under articles 7 and 8. The former generally states the overall aspiration of the community aiming for a united, inclusive and resilient community. It also puts human and environmental security as crucial points. Deepening engagement with both internal and external parties are also stressed to contribute to international peace, security and stability.<ref>{{cite web|title=ASEAN COMMUNITY VISION 2025|url=http://www.asean.org/storage/images/2015/November/aec-page/ASEAN-Community-Vision-2025.pdf}}</ref> The \"Moving Forward\" subcategory implies the acknowledgement of weaknesses of the institution's capacity to process and coordinate ASEAN work.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second two-year term until 26 May 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Food security====\nMember states recognise the importance of strengthening [[food security]] to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Security |url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |website=World Health Organisation |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917112705/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2015 |df= }}</ref> As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|last2=Caballero-Anthony|first2=Mely|last3=Teng|first3=Paul|title=Thought/Issues Paper on ASEAN Food Security: Towards a more Comprehensive Framework|date=Oct 2013|publisher=Nanyang Technological University|location=Singapore |url=http://www.eria.org/ERIA-DP-2013-20.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.<ref>Overland, Indra et al.

[[Trade facilitation]] measures and the harmonisation/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products.

It delivers a challenge to construct dynamic institutions and foster sufficient amount of social capital. The underlying assumption is that the creation of a regional identity is of special interest to ASEAN and the intent of the 2020 Vision policy document was to reassert the belief in a regional framework designed as an action plan related to human development and civic empowerment.

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.<ref>{{cite news|title=New ASEAN community offers export opportunities|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/253874/new-asean-community-offers-export-opportunities.html|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Vietnam News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Asian Development Bank]] also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline.

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russia inherited its close relationship with India which resulted in a [[Special relationship (international relations)|special relationship]].

While in India, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union supported Indian sovereignty over the disputed territory of the [[Kashmir]] region and over Portuguese coastal enclaves such as [[Goa]].\n\nThe Soviet Union's strong relations with India had a negative impact upon both Soviet relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and Indian relations with the PRC, during the Khrushchev period. The Soviet Union declared its neutrality during the 1959 border dispute and the [[Sino-Indian war]] of October 1962, although the Chinese strongly objected. The Soviet Union gave India substantial economic and military assistance during the Khrushchev period, and by 1960 India had received more Soviet assistance than China had.<ref name=\"citation needed\">citation needed</ref> This disparity became another point of contention in Sino-Soviet relations. In 1962 the Soviet Union agreed to transfer technology to co-produce the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] jet fighter in India, which the Soviet Union had earlier denied to China.<ref name=\"citation needed\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Donaldson|first=Robert H|title=India: The Soviet Stake in Stability|journal=Asian Survey|year=1972|volume=12|issue=6|page=475|doi=10.2307/2643045|jstor=2643045}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 the Soviet Union served successfully as peace broker between India and Pakistan after an [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Indian-Pakistani border war]]. The Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], literally Premier of the Soviet Union, [[Alexei Kosygin]], met with representatives of India and Pakistan and helped them negotiate an end to the military conflict over [[Kashmir]].\n\nIn 1971 the former [[East Pakistan]] region initiated an effort to secede from its political union with [[West Pakistan]]. India supported the secession and, as a guarantee against possible Chinese entrance into the conflict on the side of West Pakistan, it signed with the Soviet Union the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] in August 1971. In December, India entered the conflict and ensured the victory of the secessionists and the establishment of the new state of [[Bangladesh]].\n\nRelations between the Soviet Union and India did not suffer much during the rightist [[Janata Party]]'s coalition government in the late 1970s, although India did move to establish better economic and military relations with Western countries. To counter these efforts by India to diversify its relations, the Soviet Union proffered additional weaponry and economic assistance.\n\nDuring the 1980s, despite the 1984 assassination by Sikh separatists of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], the mainstay of cordial Indian-Soviet relations, India maintained a close relationship with the Soviet Union. Indicating the high priority of relations with the Soviet Union in Indian foreign policy, the new Indian Prime Minister, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], visited the Soviet Union on his first state visit abroad in May 1985 and signed two long-term economic agreements with the Soviet Union. According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Foreign relations of India|Indian foreign policy]], during this visit, Rajiv Gandhi developed a personal rapport with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul|title=Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s Diplomacy: Historic Significance and Contemporary  Relevance|journal=Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|page=47|url=http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref> In turn, Gorbachev's first visit to a Third World state was his meeting with Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi in late 1986. General Secretary Gorbachev unsuccessfully urged Rajiv Gandhi to help the Soviet Union set up an Asian collective security system. Gorbachev's advocacy of this proposal, which had also been made by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was an indication of continuing Soviet interest in using close relations with India as a means of containing China. With the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations in the late 1980s, containing China had less of a priority, but close relations with India remained important as an example of Gorbachev's new Third World policy.\n\n==Russia and India==\n{{Quotation|Relations with India have always been and I am sure will be one of the most important foreign policy priorities of our country.

Overall, the price tag for the 272 Sukhois - three of the over 170 inducted till now have crashed - stands at over $12 billion.

The only Indian to visit space, [[Rakesh Sharma]], was also launched by the Soviet Union. During President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s visit to India in December 2004, two space-related bilateral agreements were signed viz. Inter-Governmental umbrella Agreement on co-operation in the outer space for peaceful purposes and the Inter Space Agency Agreement on co-operation in the Russian satellite navigation system [[GLONASS]]. Subsequently, a number of follow-up agreements on GLONASS have been signed. In November 2007, the two countries have signed an agreement on joint lunar exploration. These space co-operation programmes are under implementation.\n[[Chandrayaan-2]] was a joint lunar exploration mission proposed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RKA) and had a projected cost of \u20b94.25&nbsp;billion (US$90 million). The mission, proposed to be launched in 2017 by a [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV), included a lunar orbiter and a rover made in India as well as one lander built by Russia. But due to the repeated delays in the joint venture, the Indian side ultimately decided to develop its own lander and borne all costs of the mission by itself. Later on [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] developed its own lander named Vikram and launched [[Chandrayaan-2]]  mission successfully on July 22, 2019 from [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre First Launch Pad|SDSC SHAR]], Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.[https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=192082]\n\n===Science and Technology===\nThe ongoing collaboration in the field of science & technology, under the Integrated Long-Term Programme of Co-operation (ILTP)  is the largest co-operation programme in this sphere for both India and Russia.

Development of SARAS Duet aircraft, semiconductor products, super computers, poly-vaccines, laser science and technology, seismology, high-purity materials, software & IT and Ayurveda have been some of the priority areas of co-operation under the ILTP. Under this programme, eight joint Indo-Russian centres have been established to focus on joint research and development work. Two other Joint Centres on Non-ferrous Metals and Accelerators and Lasers are being set up in India. A Joint Technology Centre based in Moscow to bring cutting edge technologies to the market is also under processing. An ILTP Joint Council met in Moscow on 11\u201312 October 2007 to review co-operation and give it further direction. In August 2007, an MoU was signed between Department of Science and Technology and Russian Foundation of Basic Research, Moscow to pursue scientific co-operation.\n\n===North-South Transport Corridor===\n{{Details|North-South Transport Corridor}}\n\n[[File:North South Transport Corridor (NSTC).jpg|thumb|right|200px|North South Transport Corridor route via [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Russia]]]]\n\nThe North\u2013South Transport Corridor is the [[ship transport|ship]], [[railways|rail]], and [[road transport|road]] route for moving freight between [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].

While in India, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union supported Indian sovereignty over the disputed territory of the [[Kashmir]] region and over Portuguese coastal enclaves such as [[Goa]].\n\nThe Soviet Union's strong relations with India had a negative impact upon both Soviet relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and Indian relations with the PRC, during the Khrushchev period. The Soviet Union declared its neutrality during the 1959 border dispute and the [[Sino-Indian war]] of October 1962, although the Chinese strongly objected. The Soviet Union gave India substantial economic and military assistance during the Khrushchev period, and by 1960 India had received more Soviet assistance than China had.<ref name=\"citation needed\">citation needed</ref> This disparity became another point of contention in Sino-Soviet relations.

The Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], literally Premier of the Soviet Union, [[Alexei Kosygin]], met with representatives of India and Pakistan and helped them negotiate an end to the military conflict over [[Kashmir]].\n\nIn 1971 the former [[East Pakistan]] region initiated an effort to secede from its political union with [[West Pakistan]]. India supported the secession and, as a guarantee against possible Chinese entrance into the conflict on the side of West Pakistan, it signed with the Soviet Union the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] in August 1971. In December, India entered the conflict and ensured the victory of the secessionists and the establishment of the new state of [[Bangladesh]].\n\nRelations between the Soviet Union and India did not suffer much during the rightist [[Janata Party]]'s coalition government in the late 1970s, although India did move to establish better economic and military relations with Western countries. To counter these efforts by India to diversify its relations, the Soviet Union proffered additional weaponry and economic assistance.\n\nDuring the 1980s, despite the 1984 assassination by Sikh separatists of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], the mainstay of cordial Indian-Soviet relations, India maintained a close relationship with the Soviet Union. Indicating the high priority of relations with the Soviet Union in Indian foreign policy, the new Indian Prime Minister, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], visited the Soviet Union on his first state visit abroad in May 1985 and signed two long-term economic agreements with the Soviet Union. According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Foreign relations of India|Indian foreign policy]], during this visit, Rajiv Gandhi developed a personal rapport with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul|title=Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s Diplomacy: Historic Significance and Contemporary  Relevance|journal=Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|page=47|url=http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref> In turn, Gorbachev's first visit to a Third World state was his meeting with Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi in late 1986. General Secretary Gorbachev unsuccessfully urged Rajiv Gandhi to help the Soviet Union set up an Asian collective security system. Gorbachev's advocacy of this proposal, which had also been made by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was an indication of continuing Soviet interest in using close relations with India as a means of containing China. With the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations in the late 1980s, containing China had less of a priority, but close relations with India remained important as an example of Gorbachev's new Third World policy.\n\n==Russia and India==\n{{Quotation|Relations with India have always been and I am sure will be one of the most important foreign policy priorities of our country.

The last joint naval exercises took place in April 2007 in the [[Sea of Japan]] and joint airborne exercises were held in September 2007 in Russia. An Inter-Governmental commission on military-technical co-operation is co-chaired by the defence ministers of the two countries. The seventh session of this Inter-Governmental Commission was held in October 2007 in Moscow. During the visit, an agreement on joint development and production of prospective multi-role fighters was signed between the two countries.\n\nIn 2012, both countries signed a defence deal worth $2.9 billion during President Putin's visit to India for the 42 new Sukhois  to be produced under licence by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics, which will add to the 230 Sukhois earlier contracted from Russia. Overall, the price tag for the 272 Sukhois - three of the over 170 inducted till now have crashed - stands at over $12 billion. The medium-lift Mi-17 V5 helicopters (59 for IAF and 12 for home ministry/BSF) will add to the 80 such choppers already being inducted under a $1.34 billion deal inked in 2008. The value of India's defence projects with Russia will further zoom north after the imminent inking of the final design contract for the joint development of a futuristic stealth fifth-generation fighter. This R&D contract is itself pegged at US$11 billion, to be shared equally by the two countries. So if India inducts over 200 of these 5th Gen fighters, as it hopes to do from 2022 onwards, the overall cost of this gigantic project for India will come to around US$35 billion since each of the jets will come for upwards of US$100 million at least.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn October 2018, India inked the historic agreement worth US$5.43 billion  with Russia to procure five [[S-400 Triumf]] surface-to-air missile defence system, the most powerful [[Missile defence|missile defence system]] in the world ignoring America's [[Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act|CAATSA act]].

The only Indian to visit space, [[Rakesh Sharma]], was also launched by the Soviet Union. During President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s visit to India in December 2004, two space-related bilateral agreements were signed viz. Inter-Governmental umbrella Agreement on co-operation in the outer space for peaceful purposes and the Inter Space Agency Agreement on co-operation in the Russian satellite navigation system [[GLONASS]]. Subsequently, a number of follow-up agreements on GLONASS have been signed. In November 2007, the two countries have signed an agreement on joint lunar exploration. These space co-operation programmes are under implementation.\n[[Chandrayaan-2]] was a joint lunar exploration mission proposed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RKA) and had a projected cost of \u20b94.25&nbsp;billion (US$90 million). The mission, proposed to be launched in 2017 by a [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV), included a lunar orbiter and a rover made in India as well as one lander built by Russia. But due to the repeated delays in the joint venture, the Indian side ultimately decided to develop its own lander and borne all costs of the mission by itself. Later on [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] developed its own lander named Vikram and launched [[Chandrayaan-2]]  mission successfully on July 22, 2019 from [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre First Launch Pad|SDSC SHAR]], Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.[https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=192082]\n\n===Science and Technology===\nThe ongoing collaboration in the field of science & technology, under the Integrated Long-Term Programme of Co-operation (ILTP)  is the largest co-operation programme in this sphere for both India and Russia.

Development of SARAS Duet aircraft, semiconductor products, super computers, poly-vaccines, laser science and technology, seismology, high-purity materials, software & IT and Ayurveda have been some of the priority areas of co-operation under the ILTP. Under this programme, eight joint Indo-Russian centres have been established to focus on joint research and development work. Two other Joint Centres on Non-ferrous Metals and Accelerators and Lasers are being set up in India. A Joint Technology Centre based in Moscow to bring cutting edge technologies to the market is also under processing. An ILTP Joint Council met in Moscow on 11\u201312 October 2007 to review co-operation and give it further direction. In August 2007, an MoU was signed between Department of Science and Technology and Russian Foundation of Basic Research, Moscow to pursue scientific co-operation.\n\n===North-South Transport Corridor===\n{{Details|North-South Transport Corridor}}\n\n[[File:North South Transport Corridor (NSTC).jpg|thumb|right|200px|North South Transport Corridor route via [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Russia]]]]\n\nThe North\u2013South Transport Corridor is the [[ship transport|ship]], [[railways|rail]], and [[road transport|road]] route for moving freight between [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].

The  theorem, whose history is the subject of much debate, is named for the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] thinker [[Pythagoras]].\n\nThe theorem has been given numerous proofs{{spndash}}possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but ''n''-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.\n\n==Rearrangement proof==\n[[File:Pythagoras-proof-anim.svg|thumb|The rearrangement proof (click to view animation)]]The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles, and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently. Therefore, the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area. Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean theorem, [[Q.E.D.]]<ref>Benson, Donald.

Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion \"that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Euclid|1956}}, pp. 351\u2013352</ref>  Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Huffman | first=Carl | title=Pythagoras | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2018 Edition) | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

The view of Pythagoras\u2019s cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this section, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a scientist, remains the consensus.\"</ref>\n\n==Other forms of the theorem==\nIf ''c'' denotes the [[length]] of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:\n: <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .</math>\nIf the lengths of both ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then ''c'' can be calculated as\n: <math> c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. </math>\nIf the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' and of one side (''a'' or ''b'') are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated as\n: <math>a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2} </math>\nor\n: <math>b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. </math>\nThe Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.\n\nA generalization of this theorem is the [[law of cosines]], which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.\n\n==Other proofs of the theorem==\nThis theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] being another contender for that distinction); the book ''The Pythagorean Proposition'' contains 370 proofs.<ref>{{Harv|Loomis|1968}}</ref>\n\n===Proof using similar triangles===\n[[File:Pythagoras similar triangles simplified.svg|thumb|Proof using similar triangles]]\nThis proof is based on the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of the sides of two [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [[ratio]] of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.\n\nLet ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. Draw the [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. Point ''H'' divides the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' into parts ''d'' and ''e''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as ''\u03b8'' in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle ''CBH'' is also similar to ''ABC''. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [[triangle postulate]]: the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]]. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\n:<math> \\frac{BC}{AB}=\\frac{BH}{BC} \\text{ and } \\frac{AC}{AB}=\\frac{AH}{AC}.</math>\nThe first result equates the [[cosine]]s of the angles ''\u03b8'', whereas the second result equates their [[sine]]s.\n\nThese ratios can be written as\n:<math>BC^2 = AB \\times BH \\text{ and } AC^2=AB \\times AH. </math>\nSumming these two equalities results in\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB\\times BH+AB\\times AH=AB\\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 ,</math>\nwhich, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem:\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \\ .</math>\n\nThe role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the ''Elements'', and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.<ref>{{Harv|Maor|2007| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&pg=PA39&dq=%22why+did+Euclid+choose+this+particular+proof%22&hl=en&ei=WckoTLv4JIKknQecwvWoAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22why%20did%20Euclid%20choose%20this%20particular%20proof%22&f=false  39]}}</ref><ref name=Hawking>\n{{cite book |title=God created the integers: the mathematical breakthroughs that changed history |author=Stephen W.

The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\n\nLet ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''. Drop a perpendicular from ''A'' to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.\n\nFor the formal proof, we require four elementary [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmata]]:\n# If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent ([[side angle side|side-angle-side]]).\n# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\n# The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.\n# The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).\n\nNext, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.<ref>See for example [http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/GeoGebra/Pythagoras.html Pythagorean theorem by shear mapping], Saint Louis University website Java applet</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem2.svg|thumb|Illustration including the new lines]]\n[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem3.svg|thumb|Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF]]\nThe proof is as follows:\n#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\n#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order.

The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup> uncovered, the second of which leaves square ''c''<sup>2</sup> uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}}\n\nA second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area ''c''<sup>2</sup>, from four identical right triangles with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides ''a'' and ''b'' by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup>, which must have the same area as the initial large square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#10 |title= Pythagorean theorem, proof number 10|author=[[Alexander Bogomolny]] |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe third, rightmost image also gives a proof.

In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.\n\n===Algebraic proofs===\n[[File:Pythagoras algebraic2.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the two algebraic proofs]]\n\nThe theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', arranged inside a square with side ''c'' as in the top half of the diagram.<ref name=rotate>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#3 |title=Cut-the-knot.org: Pythagorean theorem and its many proofs, Proof #3 |author=Alexander Bogomolny |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}\n</ref> The triangles are similar with area <math>\\tfrac12ab</math>, while the small square has side {{nowrap|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}} and area {{nowrap|(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')<sup>2</sup>}}.

A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the [[Legendre polynomials#Applications of Legendre polynomials in physics|applications of Legendre polynomials in physics]]. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras's theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

L., ''A History of Greek Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981.</ref> and was included by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'':<ref name=Euclid_VI>Euclid's ''Elements'': Book VI, Proposition VI 31: \"In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle.\"</ref>\n\n<blockquote>If one erects similar figures (see [[Euclidean geometry]]) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.</blockquote>\n\nThis extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are ''a:b:c'').<ref name=Putz>Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. \"On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem\", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291\u2013295.</ref> While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).<ref name=Putz/>\n\nThe basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are erected on sides with corresponding lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' then:\n\n:<math>\\frac{A}{a^2} = \\frac{B}{b^2} = \\frac{C}{c^2}\\, ,</math>\n:<math>\\Rightarrow A + B = \\frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \\frac{b^2}{c^2}C\\, .</math>\n\nBut, by the Pythagorean theorem, ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup>, so ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C''.\n\nConversely, if we can prove that ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle ''C'' on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (''A'' and ''B'' ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]]. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.\n\nA substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [[de Gua's theorem]], named for [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]: If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \"''n''-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\":<ref name=Bhatia>\n\n{{cite book |title=Matrix analysis |author=Rajendra Bhatia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eay3HALl620C&pg=PA21 |page=21 |isbn=0-387-94846-5 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer}}\n\n</ref>\n{{Blockquote|text=Let <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots,x_n </math> be orthogonal vectors in \u211d<sup>n</sup>.

It states that the area of the square whose side is the [[hypotenuse]] (the side opposite the [[right angle]]) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the [[Cathetus|other two sides]]. This [[theorem]] can be written as an [[equation]] relating the lengths of the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', often called the \"Pythagorean equation\":<ref name=\"Sally0\">{{cite book |title=Roots to research: a vertical development of mathematical problems |author1=Judith D.

The  theorem, whose history is the subject of much debate, is named for the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] thinker [[Pythagoras]].\n\nThe theorem has been given numerous proofs{{spndash}}possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but ''n''-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.\n\n==Rearrangement proof==\n[[File:Pythagoras-proof-anim.svg|thumb|The rearrangement proof (click to view animation)]]The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles, and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently. Therefore, the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area. Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean theorem, [[Q.E.D.]]<ref>Benson, Donald.

Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion \"that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Euclid|1956}}, pp. 351\u2013352</ref>  Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Huffman | first=Carl | title=Pythagoras | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2018 Edition) | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

The view of Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this section, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a scientist, remains the consensus.\"</ref>\n\n==Other forms of the theorem==\nIf ''c'' denotes the [[length]] of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:\n: <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .</math>\nIf the lengths of both ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then ''c'' can be calculated as\n: <math> c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. </math>\nIf the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' and of one side (''a'' or ''b'') are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated as\n: <math>a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2} </math>\nor\n: <math>b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. </math>\nThe Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.\n\nA generalization of this theorem is the [[law of cosines]], which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.\n\n==Other proofs of the theorem==\nThis theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] being another contender for that distinction); the book ''The Pythagorean Proposition'' contains 370 proofs.<ref>{{Harv|Loomis|1968}}</ref>\n\n===Proof using similar triangles===\n[[File:Pythagoras similar triangles simplified.svg|thumb|Proof using similar triangles]]\nThis proof is based on the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of the sides of two [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [[ratio]] of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.\n\nLet ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. Draw the [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. Point ''H'' divides the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' into parts ''d'' and ''e''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as ''\u03b8'' in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle ''CBH'' is also similar to ''ABC''. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [[triangle postulate]]: the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]]. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:\n:<math> \\frac{BC}{AB}=\\frac{BH}{BC} \\text{ and } \\frac{AC}{AB}=\\frac{AH}{AC}.</math>\nThe first result equates the [[cosine]]s of the angles ''\u03b8'', whereas the second result equates their [[sine]]s.\n\nThese ratios can be written as\n:<math>BC^2 = AB \\times BH \\text{ and } AC^2=AB \\times AH. </math>\nSumming these two equalities results in\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB\\times BH+AB\\times AH=AB\\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 ,</math>\nwhich, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem:\n:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \\ .</math>\n\nThe role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the ''Elements'', and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.<ref>{{Harv|Maor|2007| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&pg=PA39&dq=%22why+did+Euclid+choose+this+particular+proof%22&hl=en&ei=WckoTLv4JIKknQecwvWoAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22why%20did%20Euclid%20choose%20this%20particular%20proof%22&f=false  39]}}</ref><ref name=Hawking>\n{{cite book |title=God created the integers: the mathematical breakthroughs that changed history |author=Stephen W.

The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.\n\nLet ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''. Drop a perpendicular from ''A'' to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.\n\nFor the formal proof, we require four elementary [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmata]]:\n# If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent ([[side angle side|side-angle-side]]).\n# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\n# The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.\n# The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).\n\nNext, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.<ref>See for example [http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/GeoGebra/Pythagoras.html Pythagorean theorem by shear mapping], Saint Louis University website Java applet</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem2.svg|thumb|Illustration including the new lines]]\n[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem3.svg|thumb|Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF]]\nThe proof is as follows:\n#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\n#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order.

The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup> uncovered, the second of which leaves square ''c''<sup>2</sup> uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}}\n\nA second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area ''c''<sup>2</sup>, from four identical right triangles with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides ''a'' and ''b'' by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup>, which must have the same area as the initial large square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#10 |title= Pythagorean theorem, proof number 10|author=[[Alexander Bogomolny]] |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse \u2013 or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two.

In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.

L., ''A History of Greek Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981.</ref> and was included by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'':<ref name=Euclid_VI>Euclid's ''Elements'': Book VI, Proposition VI 31: \"In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle.\"</ref>\n\n<blockquote>If one erects similar figures (see [[Euclidean geometry]]) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.</blockquote>\n\nThis extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are ''a:b:c'').<ref name=Putz>Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. \"On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem\", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291\u2013295.</ref> While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).<ref name=Putz/>\n\nThe basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are erected on sides with corresponding lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' then:\n\n:<math>\\frac{A}{a^2} = \\frac{B}{b^2} = \\frac{C}{c^2}\\, ,</math>\n:<math>\\Rightarrow A + B = \\frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \\frac{b^2}{c^2}C\\, .</math>\n\nBut, by the Pythagorean theorem, ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup>, so ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C''.\n\nConversely, if we can prove that ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle ''C'' on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (''A'' and ''B'' ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]]. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram).

Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' is found from Pythagoras's theorem as:\n\n:<math> \\overline{BD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{BC}^{\\,2} + \\overline{CD}^{\\,2} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras's theorem as:\n\n:<math> \\overline{AD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{AB}^{\\,2} + \\overline{BD}^{\\,2} \\ ,</math>\nor, doing it all in one step:\n:<math> \\overline{AD}^{\\,2} = \\overline{AB}^{\\,2} + \\overline{BC}^{\\,2} + \\overline{CD}^{\\,2} \\ .</math>\n\nThis result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector '''v''' (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {'''v'''<sub>k</sub>} (the three mutually perpendicular sides):\n\n:<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\|\\mathbf{v}_k\\|^2.</math>\n\nThis one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras's theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.\n\nA substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [[de Gua's theorem]], named for [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]: If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \"''n''-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\":<ref name=Bhatia>\n\n{{cite book |title=Matrix analysis |author=Rajendra Bhatia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eay3HALl620C&pg=PA21 |page=21 |isbn=0-387-94846-5 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer}}\n\n</ref>\n{{Blockquote|text=Let <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots,x_n </math> be orthogonal vectors in \u211d<sup>n</sup>.

The \"hypotenuse\" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the \"legs\" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam.

These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs, plywood, or the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. \n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material.\n\n==== Rigs ====\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Accommodations ====\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows planning the route. <ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA197&dq=canting+keel|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Superyacht]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht racing]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yacht tender]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats.

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n==== Construction ====\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs, plywood, or the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. \n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material.\n\n==== Rigs ====\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Accommodations ====\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows planning the route. <ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA197&dq=canting+keel|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Superyacht]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht racing]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yacht tender]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.
