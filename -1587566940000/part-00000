The Shamarpa is the second most important teacher of the Karma Kagyu school after the [[Karmapa]]. The Karmapas are sometimes referred to as the Black Hat Lamas, referring to their [[Black Crown]].\n\n[[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]], prophesied that \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]] forms\". Later, [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]] presented his principal student, Khedrup Drakpa Senge, a ruby-red crown that was an exact replica of his own Black Crown. The Karmapa explained that it symbolised their identical nature and so the lineage of the Shamarpas started. The 14th Shamarpa was recognised by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIn 1956 Shamar Rinpoche and his brother [[Jigme Rinpoche]] went to [[Tsurphu]], the seat of the Karmapas in Lhasa. The 4 year old Shamarpa showed special abilities, including recognizing a few monks from a previous life at Yangpachen monastery. With these special signs the 16th Karmapa asked the Dalai Lama to revoke the prohibition of the Sharmapa incarnations. (See [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]) Consent was given and private enthronement took place in 1958. His formal education took place at [[Rumtek]] and he received transmission initiations from the Karmapa and other Kagyu and [[Nyngma]] masters.<ref>Seegers, Manfred, \"The Extraordinary Life of the 14th Shamar Rinpoche.\" Buddhism Today Spring Summer 2017: 36-37 print</ref> In 1964 the Tibetan Government in Exile formally lifted the 170 year ban on the Shamarpa institution. Shamar Rinpoche was officially enthroned.<ref>https://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/buddhist-teachers/shamar-rinpoche/</ref> After completing his studies in 1979 Sharmapa began his extensive teaching activity. \n\n== Activity ==\n\nIn the 1980s the 14th Shamar Rinpoche established an education center for Tibetan exiles in Rumtek, the Nalanda Institute. He also founded an education center in Kalimpong and retreat center in Parphing. He also oversaw the construction of the [[Karmapa International Buddhist Institute]], and ran the institute personally in its first years of inception.<ref>Seegers, Manfred, \"The Extraordinary Life of the 14th Shamar Rinpoche.\" Buddhism Today Spring Summer 2017: 37-38 print</ref> \n\nShamarpa looked after 800 traditional monasteries throughout Tibet and the Himalayas. In the West Shamarpa founded a retreat center in Virginia in 1996 as well as other Bodhi Path centers, nonsectarian and secular meditation groups.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shamarpa-without-borders/</ref> He wrote a book about reforming government corruption, and cared deeply about animals, founding the \"Infinite Compassion Foundation\" for humane and ethical treatment.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shamarpa-without-borders/</ref> \n\n== Karmapa controversy ==\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Shamarpa was a central figure in the [[Karmapa controversy|current controversy]] within the Karma Kagyu lineage.  He recognised [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] as the current (17th) [[Karmapa]], as opposed to [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]],<ref>[http://www.karmapa-issue.org/arguments/historic_meeting.htm Statement of Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche Concerning His Meeting with H.H. the Dalai Lama On June 20, 2000]</ref> whom other high lamas within the lineage recognised to be the current Karmapa, as does the [[14th Dalai Lama]] and civil authorities in [[China]].\n\n== Death ==\n\nAfter having completed several days of teachings, the 14th Shamarpa died at the age of 61 [[Renchen]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], on 11 June 2014 due to a sudden heart attack in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shamar Rinpoche passed away |url=http://bodhipath-renchen-ulm.de/news-pressestimmen/news-view/shamar-rinpoche-ploetzlicher-herztod-sudden-heart-death/f2ea01e63898e497e72962159fa6df41/ |archivedate=2014-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615034457/http://bodhipath-renchen-ulm.de/news-pressestimmen/news-view/shamar-rinpoche-ploetzlicher-herztod-sudden-heart-death/f2ea01e63898e497e72962159fa6df41/ }}</ref> \u201cAll beings, even the Buddha himself, must pass,\u201d he told his followers just before his death.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/in-his-next-life-late-buddhist-leader-said-he-hoped-to-help-animals/2014/12/01/c4b3a122-69ba-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html</ref> The government of Nepal granted a \u201cno objection\u201d letter to perform the traditional cremation at Rinpoche\u2019s new Shar Minub monastery in Kathmandu.

As a result of not being allowed in Nepal, the corpse was greeted by tens of thousands of people in Renchen-Ulm, Germany, majority [[Diamond Way]] students; then New Delhi and Kalimpong, India; and finally the Royal Palace in Bhutan, where Shamar Rinpoche had a close relationship with the royal family. The Nepalese government reversed their decision again, and the final cremation took place in Kathmandu.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shamarpa-without-borders/?fbclid=IwAR2yxKEesPG80sy8zuBKKEE2Xo5PON7DEy2y1hDEE2luQX0BMfANSNvMjfc</ref>\n\nRelics of Shamar Rinpoche were placed in stupas at Dhagpo Kagyu Ling in France and Renchen Ulm, Germany.

The Shamarpa is the second most important teacher of the Karma Kagyu school after the [[Karmapa]]. The Karmapas are sometimes referred to as the Black Hat Lamas, referring to their [[Black Crown]].\n\n[[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]], prophesied that \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]] forms\". Later, [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]] presented his principal student, Khedrup Drakpa Senge, a ruby-red crown that was an exact replica of his own Black Crown. The Karmapa explained that it symbolised their identical nature and so the lineage of the Shamarpas started. The 14th Shamarpa was recognised by [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIn 1956 Shamar Rinpoche and his brother [[Jigme Rinpoche]] went to [[Tsurphu]], the seat of the Karmapas in Lhasa. The 4 year old Shamarpa showed special abilities, including recognizing a few monks from a previous life at Yangpachen monastery. With these special signs the 16th Karmapa asked the Dalai Lama to revoke the prohibition of the Sharmapa incarnations. (See [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]) Consent was given and private enthronement took place in 1958. His formal education took place at [[Rumtek]] and he received transmission initiations from the Karmapa and other Kagyu and [[Nyngma]] masters.<ref>Seegers, Manfred, \"The Extraordinary Life of the 14th Shamar Rinpoche.\" Buddhism Today Spring Summer 2017: 36-37 print</ref> In 1964 the Tibetan Government in Exile formally lifted the 170 year ban on the Shamarpa institution. Shamar Rinpoche was officially enthroned.<ref>https://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/buddhist-teachers/shamar-rinpoche/</ref> After completing his studies in 1979 Sharmapa began his extensive teaching activity. \n\n== Activity ==\n\nIn the 1980s the 14th Shamar Rinpoche established an education center for Tibetan exiles in Rumtek, the Nalanda Institute. He also founded an education center in Kalimpong and retreat center in Parphing. He also oversaw the construction of the [[Karmapa International Buddhist Institute]], and ran the institute personally in its first years of inception.<ref>Seegers, Manfred, \"The Extraordinary Life of the 14th Shamar Rinpoche.\" Buddhism Today Spring Summer 2017: 37-38 print</ref> \n\nShamarpa looked after 800 traditional monasteries throughout Tibet and the Himalayas. In the West Shamarpa founded a retreat center in Virginia in 1996 as well as other Bodhi Path centers, nonsectarian and secular meditation groups.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shamarpa-without-borders/</ref> He wrote a book about reforming government corruption, and cared deeply about animals, founding the \"Infinite Compassion Foundation\" for humane and ethical treatment.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shamarpa-without-borders/</ref> \n\n== Karmapa controversy ==\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Shamarpa was a central figure in the [[Karmapa controversy|current controversy]] within the Karma Kagyu lineage.  He recognised [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] as the current (17th) [[Karmapa]], as opposed to [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]],<ref>[http://www.karmapa-issue.org/arguments/historic_meeting.htm Statement of Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche Concerning His Meeting with H.H. the Dalai Lama On June 20, 2000]</ref> whom other high lamas within the lineage recognised to be the current Karmapa, as does the [[14th Dalai Lama]] and civil authorities in [[China]].\n\n== Death ==\n\nAfter having completed several days of teachings, the 14th Shamarpa died at the age of 61 [[Renchen]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], on 11 June 2014 due to a sudden heart attack in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shamar Rinpoche passed away |url=http://bodhipath-renchen-ulm.de/news-pressestimmen/news-view/shamar-rinpoche-ploetzlicher-herztod-sudden-heart-death/f2ea01e63898e497e72962159fa6df41/ |archivedate=2014-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615034457/http://bodhipath-renchen-ulm.de/news-pressestimmen/news-view/shamar-rinpoche-ploetzlicher-herztod-sudden-heart-death/f2ea01e63898e497e72962159fa6df41/ }}</ref> \u201cAll beings, even the Buddha himself, must pass,\u201d he told his followers just before his death.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/in-his-next-life-late-buddhist-leader-said-he-hoped-to-help-animals/2014/12/01/c4b3a122-69ba-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html</ref> The government of Nepal granted a \u201cno objection\u201d letter to to perform the traditional cremation at Rinpoche\u2019s new Shar Minub monastery in Kathmandu.

For this reason, molecular targets have been identified and are being developed for treatment in patients who have more difficulty responding to treatment. There are a number of genetic factors that can be used to identify high-risk patients. In neuroblastoma cells, there can be amplification of genomic DNA regions, loss of genomic DNA regions, and genetic abnormalities.<ref name=\"Kamijo\" /> All of these factors can contribute to an advanced disease state in high-risk patients.\n\nAmplification occurs within a protein called the [[MYCN]] [[oncogene]]. This [[protein]] is amplified in approximately 20% of primary neuroblastoma tumors and is associated with advanced disease state and treatment failure.<ref name=\"Kamijo\" />\n\nLoss of genomic regions by deletion can occur at [[chromosome]]s 1p and 11q. Loss at 1p is correlated with MYCN amplification and advanced disease state.<ref name=\"Kamijo\" /> The loss at 11q is not related to MYCN, but is correlated with adverse patient outcomes.<ref name=\"Kamijo\" />\n\nGenetic abnormalities frequently occur in a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumor-suppressor gene]] called [[caspase 8]].
