He was on [[Interpol]]'s most wanted list in the 1970s and 1980s for robberies and murders committed in a number of countries across Europe, and was later indicted by the UN for [[crimes against humanity]] for his role during the wars.

He took the nickname \"Arkan\" from one of his forged passports. On 28 December 1973, he was arrested in Belgium following a bank robbery, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHe managed to escape from the [[Verviers]] prison on 4 July 1979.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/> Although Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year sentence at a prison in [[Amsterdam]], he pulled off another escape on 8 May 1981 after someone slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in West Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first passerby and stealing his clothing before disappearing.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHis final European arrest occurred in [[Basel]], Switzerland during a routine traffic check on 15 February 1983. However he managed to escape again within months, this time from [[Thorberg Castle|Thorberg]] prison on 27 April. It is widely speculated that Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was closely affiliated with the Yugoslav security service [[UDBA]] throughout his criminal career abroad.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHe had convictions or warrants in Belgium (bank robberies, prison escape), the Netherlands (armed robberies, prison escape), Sweden (20 burglaries, 7 bank robberies, prison escape, attempted murder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9903/31/kosovo5.html|title=Aftonbladet nyheter: Kriget om Kosovo|publisher=aftonbladet.se|date=31 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>), [[West Germany]] (armed robberies, prison escape), Austria, Switzerland (armed robberies, prison escape), and Italy.\n\n===Return to Yugoslavia===\nThirty-one-year-old Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 returned to Belgrade in May 1983, continuing his criminal career by opening a number of illegal businesses. \n\nIn November 1983, six months after his return, a bank in Zagreb was robbed with the robbers leaving a rose on the counter \u2013 allegedly Ra\u017enatovi\u0107's signature from his Western European robberies.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Looking to question Arkan about his whereabouts during the robbery, two policemen, members of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs' (SUP) Tenth department from the Belgrade municipality of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]], showed up in civilian clothing at his mother's apartment on 27 March Street in Belgrade.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 happened not to be home at the moment, so the policemen introduced themselves to his mother as \"friends of her son looking to return a cash debt they owed him\" and asked the women if they can stick around in the apartment to wait for him to return. His mother phoned him to say that two unknown males waited for him, which was enough for him to clue in that something's amiss.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> He showed up with a revolver and proceeded to shoot and wound both policemen \u2013 shooting the first one on the spot and the other in front of the apartment building as he tried to flee the scene. Arkan was detained immediately; however, barely 48 hours later, he was released. The occurrence made it clear to all observers, especially his criminal rivals, that he enjoyed protection from the highest echelons of the political leadership in SFR Yugoslavia. \n\nHe spent the mid-1980s running a disco club, \"Amadeus\", together with \u017dika \u017divac and Tapi Male\u0161evi\u0107. Located in the [[Ta\u0161majdan]] neighbourhood, the club was reportedly another perk of their contractual work for the security service.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" />\n\nFurthermore, Arkan could be seen riding around Belgrade in his pink [[Cadillac]] and gambling on [[roulette]] in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby [[Pan\u010devo]] to [[Sveti Stefan]] and [[Portoro\u017e]].<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Following a game of [[poker]] in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street in Belgrade, an elevator altercation started with a tenant from the apartment building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He could not avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange between him and the judge \u2013 during the pre-session identification, Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document summarizing a mortgage loan he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street.

The force, led by Arkan and [[Milorad Ulemek|Legija]], consisted of a core of 200 men and perhaps totaled no more than 500 to 1,000, but was much feared.<ref>Vasic, \"Yugoslav Army\" p. 134; UN experts ''Final Report'' par. 92, 139</ref> It saw action from mid-1991 until late 1995, and was supplied and equipped privately, by the reserves of the Serbian police force, and through capturing enemy arms.\n\nWhen war in Croatia broke out, the unit was active in the [[Vukovar]] region. After the Bosnian War broke out in April 1992 the unit moved between the Croatian and Bosnian fronts, engaging in multiple instances of ethnic cleansing by killing and forcefully deporting mostly Bosniak civilians. In Croatia, it fought in various areas in [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] (Serbian Krajina). Arkan reportedly had a dispute over military operations with Krajina leader [[Milan Marti\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/108/t108-4.htm|title=Vreme News Digest Agency No 108|publisher=Scc.rutgers.edu|date=18 October 1993|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> In Bosnia, the unit notably fought in battles in and around [[Zvornik]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Br\u010dko (city)|Br\u010dko]], mostly against Bosniak and Bosnian Croat paramilitary groups.\n\nIn late 1995 his troops fought in the area of [[Banja Luka]], [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]].

Several younger soldiers were rewarded for their actions in and around [[Kopa\u010dki Rit]] and [[Bijelo Brdo, Croatia|Bijelo Brdo]]. Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 reportedly sent one of his most trusted men, Radovan Stani\u0161i\u0107, to Italy to start a relationship with [[Camorra]] boss [[Francesco Schiavone]]. According to [[Roberto Saviano]], Schiavone eased arms smuggling to Serbia by stopping the Albanian mobsters' blocking of weapons routes, and helped money transfer into Serbia in the form of humanitarian aid [[Sanctions against Serbia|amid the international sanctions]].

For some Serbs he was a patriot and folk hero, while serving as a target of hatred and fear to their enemies.\n\n<blockquote>Arkan became an untouchable criminal figure in Belgrade and all of the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that \u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very hard to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the postwar period after the [[Dayton agreement]] was signed, Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 returned to his interests in sport and private business. The Serb Volunteer Guard was officially disbanded in April 1996, with the threat of being reactivated in case of war. In June of that year he took over a second division soccer team, [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|FK Obili\u0107]], which he soon turned into a top caliber club, even winning the [[First League of FR Yugoslavia 1997-98|1997/98]] [[Serbian Superliga|Yugoslav league]] championship. According to a book by [[Franklin Foer]], ''[[How Soccer Explains the World|How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization]]'', Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 threatened players on opposing teams if they scored against [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|Obili\u0107]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThis threat was underlined by the thousands of veterans from his army that filled their home field, chanting threats, and on occasion pointing pistols at opposition players during matches. One player told the British football magazine ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' that he was locked in a garage when his team played [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|Obili\u0107]]. Europe's football governing body, [[UEFA]], considered prohibiting Obili\u0107 from participation in continental competitions because of its connections to Ra\u017enatovi\u0107. In response to this, Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 stepped away from the position of president and gave his seat to his wife [[Svetlana Ceca Ra\u017enatovi\u0107|Ceca]]. In a 2006 interview, [[Dragoslav \u0160ekularac]] (who was coach of Obili\u0107 while Arkan was with the club) said claims that Arkan verbally and physically assaulted Obili\u0107 players were false.<ref name=\"Get out of here, I am Sekularac by Prvoslav Vujcic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/get-out-of-here-i-am-sekularac-by-prvoslav-vujcic.html|author=[[Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107]], ''[[Urban Book Circle]]''|title=Get out of here, I am \u0160ekularac|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=1 May 2006}}</ref> Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was a chairman of the Yugoslav Kickboxing Association.\n\n==Kosovo War and NATO bombing==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\nAccording to chief judge [[Richard May (judge)|Richard May]] from the United Kingdom, the [[ICTY]] issued an indictment against Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 on 30 September 1997 for war crimes of [[genocide]] against the Muslim population, [[crimes against humanity]] and grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ark-ii970930e.htm|title=Tpiy|publisher=Un.org|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> The warrant was not made public until 31 March 1999, a week after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] had begun, as intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u201399).

He was on [[Interpol]]'s most wanted list in the 1970s and 1980s for robberies and murders committed in a number of countries across Europe, and was later indicted by the UN for [[crimes against humanity]] for his role during the wars.

He took the nickname \"Arkan\" from one of his forged passports. On 28 December 1973, he was arrested in Belgium following a bank robbery, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHe managed to escape from the [[Verviers]] prison on 4 July 1979.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/> Although Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year sentence at a prison in [[Amsterdam]], he pulled off another escape on 8 May 1981 after someone slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in West Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first passerby and stealing his clothing before disappearing.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHis final European arrest occurred in [[Basel]], Switzerland during a routine traffic check on 15 February 1983. However he managed to escape again within months, this time from [[Thorberg Castle|Thorberg]] prison on 27 April. It is widely speculated that Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was closely affiliated with the Yugoslav security service [[UDBA]] throughout his criminal career abroad.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\"/>\n\nHe had convictions or warrants in Belgium (bank robberies, prison escape), the Netherlands (armed robberies, prison escape), Sweden (20 burglaries, 7 bank robberies, prison escape, attempted murder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9903/31/kosovo5.html|title=Aftonbladet nyheter: Kriget om Kosovo|publisher=aftonbladet.se|date=31 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>), [[West Germany]] (armed robberies, prison escape), Austria, Switzerland (armed robberies, prison escape), and Italy.\n\n===Return to Yugoslavia===\nThirty-one-year-old Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 returned to Belgrade in May 1983, continuing his criminal career by opening a number of illegal businesses. \n\nIn November 1983, six months after his return, a bank in Zagreb was robbed with the robbers leaving a rose on the counter \u2013 allegedly Ra\u017enatovi\u0107's signature from his Western European robberies.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Looking to question Arkan about his whereabouts during the robbery, two policemen, members of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs' (SUP) Tenth department from the Belgrade municipality of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]], showed up in civilian clothing at his mother's apartment on 27 March Street in Belgrade.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 happened not to be home at the moment, so the policemen introduced themselves to his mother as \"friends of her son looking to return a cash debt they owed him\" and asked the women if they can stick around in the apartment to wait for him to return. His mother phoned him to say that two unknown males waited for him, which was enough for him to clue in that something's amiss.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> He showed up with a revolver and proceeded to shoot and wound both policemen \u2013 shooting the first one on the spot and the other in front of the apartment building as he tried to flee the scene. Arkan was detained immediately; however, barely 48 hours later, he was released. The occurrence made it clear to all observers, especially his criminal rivals, that he enjoyed protection from the highest echelons of the political leadership in SFR Yugoslavia. \n\nHe spent the mid-1980s running a disco club, \"Amadeus\", together with \u017dika \u017divac and Tapi Male\u0161evi\u0107. Located in the [[Ta\u0161majdan]] neighbourhood, the club was reportedly another perk of their contractual work for the security service.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" />\n\nFurthermore, Arkan could be seen riding around Belgrade in his pink [[Cadillac]] and gambling on [[roulette]] in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby [[Pan\u010devo]] to [[Sveti Stefan]] and [[Portoro\u017e]].<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" /> Following a game of [[poker]] in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street in Belgrade, an elevator altercation started with a tenant from the apartment building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He could not avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange between him and the judge \u2013 during the pre-session identification, Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document summarizing a mortgage loan he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street. He ended up receiving a six-month sentence, which he served at the Belgrade Central Prison.<ref name=\"Arkanova ostav\u0161tina\" />\n\n==Yugoslav Wars==\n===Early===\nOnly days after the Croatian elections in 1990, Ra\u017enatovi\u0107, who was the leader of the ''[[Delije]]'' (football club [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s Ultras), was present at the away game against Croatian side [[Dinamo Zagreb]] at [[Stadion Maksimir]] on 13 May 1990, a match that ended in the infamous [[Dinamo\u2013Red Star riot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |title=VIDEO: Day When Maksimir Stadium Went up in Flames |publisher=Dalje.com |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301221046/http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}</ref> Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 and the Delije, consisting of 1,500 people, were involved in a huge fight with the [[Bad Blue Boys|home team's football hooligans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/5707-football-is-war.html|title=Football is War|publisher=Tol.org|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 October 1990, as the political situation in Yugoslavia became tense (see [[Log Revolution]]), Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 created a paramilitary group named the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]].

On 29 November 1990, Croatian police arrested him at the Croatian-Bosnian border crossing [[Dvor na Uni]], along with local Du\u0161an Cari\u0107, and Belgraders Du\u0161an Bandi\u0107 and Zoran Stevanovi\u0107.

The force, led by Arkan and [[Milorad Ulemek|Legija]], consisted of a core of 200 men and perhaps totaled no more than 500 to 1,000, but was much feared.<ref>Vasic, \"Yugoslav Army\" p. 134; UN experts ''Final Report'' par. 92, 139</ref> It saw action from mid-1991 until late 1995, and was supplied and equipped privately, by the reserves of the Serbian police force, and through capturing enemy arms.\n\nWhen war in Croatia broke out, the unit was active in the [[Vukovar]] region. After the Bosnian War broke out in April 1992 the unit moved between the Croatian and Bosnian fronts, engaging in multiple instances of ethnic cleansing by killing and forcefully deporting mostly Bosniak civilians. In Croatia, it fought in various areas in [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] (Serbian Krajina). Arkan reportedly had a dispute over military operations with Krajina leader [[Milan Marti\u0107]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/108/t108-4.htm|title=Vreme News Digest Agency No 108|publisher=Scc.rutgers.edu|date=18 October 1993|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> In Bosnia, the unit notably fought in battles in and around [[Zvornik]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Br\u010dko (city)|Br\u010dko]], mostly against Bosniak and Bosnian Croat paramilitary groups.\n\nIn late 1995 his troops fought in the area of [[Banja Luka]], [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]].

Several younger soldiers were rewarded for their actions in and around [[Kopa\u010dki Rit]] and [[Bijelo Brdo, Croatia|Bijelo Brdo]]. Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 reportedly sent one of his most trusted men, Radovan Stani\u0161i\u0107, to Italy to start a relationship with [[Camorra]] boss [[Francesco Schiavone]]. According to [[Roberto Saviano]], Schiavone eased arms smuggling to Serbia by stopping the Albanian mobsters' blocking of weapons routes, and helped money transfer into Serbia in the form of humanitarian aid [[Sanctions against Serbia|amid the international sanctions]].

For some Serbs he was a patriot and folk hero, while serving as a target of hatred and fear to their enemies.\n\n<blockquote>Arkan became an untouchable criminal figure in Belgrade and all of the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that \u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very hard to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the postwar period after the [[Dayton agreement]] was signed, Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 returned to his interests in sport and private business. The Serb Volunteer Guard was officially disbanded in April 1996, with the threat of being reactivated in case of war. In June of that year he took over a second division soccer team, [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|FK Obili\u0107]], which he soon turned into a top caliber club, even winning the [[First League of FR Yugoslavia 1997-98|1997/98]] [[Serbian Superliga|Yugoslav league]] championship. According to a book by [[Franklin Foer]], ''[[How Soccer Explains the World|How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization]]'', Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 threatened players on opposing teams if they scored against [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|Obili\u0107]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThis threat was underlined by the thousands of veterans from his army that filled their home field, chanting threats, and on occasion pointing pistols at opposition players during matches. One player told the British football magazine ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' that he was locked in a garage when his team played [[FK Obili\u0107 Belgrade|Obili\u0107]]. Europe's football governing body, [[UEFA]], considered prohibiting Obili\u0107 from participation in continental competitions because of its connections to Ra\u017enatovi\u0107. In response to this, Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 stepped away from the position of president and gave his seat to his wife [[Svetlana Ceca Ra\u017enatovi\u0107|Ceca]]. In a 2006 interview, [[Dragoslav \u0160ekularac]] (who was coach of Obili\u0107 while Arkan was with the club) said claims that Arkan verbally and physically assaulted Obili\u0107 players were false.<ref name=\"Get out of here, I am Sekularac by Prvoslav Vujcic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/get-out-of-here-i-am-sekularac-by-prvoslav-vujcic.html|author=[[Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107]], ''[[Urban Book Circle]]''|title=Get out of here, I am \u0160ekularac|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=1 May 2006}}</ref> Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was a chairman of the Yugoslav Kickboxing Association.\n\n==Kosovo War and NATO bombing==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\nAccording to chief judge [[Richard May (judge)|Richard May]] from the United Kingdom, the [[ICTY]] issued an indictment against Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 on 30 September 1997 for war crimes of [[genocide]] against the Muslim population, [[crimes against humanity]] and grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ark-ii970930e.htm|title=Tpiy|publisher=Un.org|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> The warrant was not made public until 31 March 1999, a week after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] had begun, as intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u201399).

Her father, celebrated poet [[Don McKay|Don McKay,]] and her mother, Jean McKay, were both writers. McKay\u2019s brother Joe is also an artist. McKay attended [[Medway High School (Arva, Ontario)|Medway High School]] in Arva, Ontario before studying at [[NSCAD University|Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] in Halifax, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, with an Art History Minor, in 1990 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://arthistory.gradstudies.yorku.ca/student-profiles-phd/|title=Student Profiles - PhD {{!}} Art History {{!}} Faculty of Graduate Studies {{!}} York University|website=arthistory.gradstudies.yorku.ca|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>. In the years following her graduation, McKay moved to Toronto where she established herself as a prominent artist and curator <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. In 2014, McKay completed a PhD. in Art History and Visual Culture from [[York University]], with a thesis entitled \u201cRepositioning Neuroaesthetics Through Contemporary Art\u201d <ref name=\":8\" />. Whilst at York University McKay was awarded the Joyce and Fred Zeman\u2019s Scholarship <ref name=\":8\" />. &nbsp;\n\n==Employment History==\n\n** Assistant Professor, School of the Arts, McMaster University, Contractually Limited Appointment (2014-2018)\n** Full Time Lecturer, School of the Arts, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, (2012-2014)\n** Sessional Instructor, School of Fine Arts and Music, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, (2011)\n** Sessional Instructor, Visual Art and Art History, Faculty of Fine Arts, York University, Toronto, ON (2009)\n** Editor, ''WADE'' a catalogue accompanying the a public art exhibition in Toronto wading pools curated by Sandra Rechico and Christie Pearson (2007)\n** Managing Editor at YYZ Books, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Toronto (2003-2004)\n** Founding co-editor/owner, ''Lola'' magazine with Catherine Osborne (1997-2003)\n\n==Art==\nOver the span of three decades McKay has produced art in an array of media including; performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, digital and installation art. McKay\u2019s performance art has been called \u201cintense\u201d and her 12-hour performance piece \u201cBedTime Fortune Story Teller\u201d for example, has been said to demonstrate her interest in pushing art to extremes <ref name=\":1\" />. McKay was an early adopter of digital art and has demonstrated a keen interest in digital surveillance. In a 2005 exhibition, McKay combined gifs and installation art, which at the time, was considered to be cutting edge multimedia work <ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|last=Vaughan|first=RM|url=|title=Cache Them If You Can|date=July 30, 2005|work=National Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. McKay has also produced work with a social purpose and has seen performance art as having the power to transform society <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite news|last=Stoffman|first=Judy|url=|title=Toronto Streets Claim Another Bike Rider|date=September 4, 1998|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. McKay combined performance art and advocacy in her 1998 work with Spirit of Spadina. McKay created a number of mass-protests and performances in the middle of Toronto\u2019s highways to draw attention to the number of cyclists killed in Toronto <ref name=\":10\" />. McKay has also used more traditional art forms, and has received critical praise for her drawings <ref name=\":1\" />. McKay\u2019s sketches of brain waves and her rendering of abstract neuroscientific concepts into sketches was a prominent aspect of her later art <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=Amos|first=Robert|url=|title=Quick Drawings Outrun Self-Censoring Consciousness|date=February 7, 2008|work=Times Colonist|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />. McKay placed a greater focus on teaching, research and academia as she began her PhD in 2014 but continues to produce art <ref name=\":2\" /> <ref>{{Cite news|last=Reid|first=Robert|url=|title=Knock On Wood; Nature Still Endures|date=July 28, 2007|work=The Record|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":8\" />. &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n==Teaching==\nMcKay has worked as an educator and professor at a number of Canadian universities. In 2009, McKay was a Sessional Instructor in the Faculty of Fine Arts at York University, while she was studying for a PhD there <ref name=\":8\" />. In 2011, McKay became a Sessional Instructor in the School of Fine Arts and Music at the [[University of Guelph]] <ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sallymckay.ca/|title=Sally McKay - Bio|last=McKay|first=Sally|date=2018|website=Sally Mckay|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. From 2012-2014, while she was still completing her PhD, she was also a Full Time Lecturer in the School of the Arts at [[McMaster University]] <ref name=\":12\" />. After graduating from York University in 2014, McKay worked as a full time university professor. From 2014-2018, McKay was an Assistant Professor at McMaster University in the School of the Arts <ref name=\":12\" />. Throughout her decade of teaching, McKay has led courses in an array of disciplines, notably: Art History and Visual Culture, Contemporary Art, Canadian Art, Neuroaesthetics, Digital Media, Multimedia and Installation Art and Performance Art <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/articles/hidden-gems-on-display-at-mills-library-if-you-can-find-them/|title=Hidden gems on display at Mills Library, if you can find them|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>. McKay has suggested her teaching philosophy positions student-directed learning as the core value of her teaching practice <ref name=\":12\" />. During her time at McMaster University McKay taught a range of courses that combined practice, theory and research in a number of disciplines <ref name=\":12\" />. Some of McKay\u2019s teaching areas include: Visual Art, Canadian Art History, Community Exhibitions, Applied Humanities and Studio Methods.&nbsp; McKay believes that the success of her courses is due, in part, to the careful structuring of lectures and assignments that encouraged students to value their own life experiences in relation to art practice and analysis <ref name=\":12\" />. \n\n==Themes==\nOver the course of her career McKay has produced works, which explore a number of different themes. In the late 90s, McKay created a number of artworks, which examined government safety campaigns, especially campaigns about the safety of cyclists and pedestrians in [[Toronto]] <ref name=\":10\" />. In 1998 McKay joined the Spirit of Spadina group, which sought to use performance art as a vehicle through which to pressure [[Toronto City Council]]<nowiki/>into adding a bike lane on the busy Spadina Avenue <ref name=\":10\" />. McKay organised and participated in a mid-road vigil in 1998 with Spirit of Spadina to commemorate the death of James Macmillan <ref name=\":10\" />. Between 1998 and 2000 McKay collaborated with Ben Lea Smith on \u201cSafety Animal\u201d a performance piece which attempted to engage with the public and satirise safety campaigns which position a burden of responsibility onto cyclists and pedestrians rather than cars and lorries <ref name=\":2\" />. \u201cSafety Animal\u201d was performed at the \u201cOffsite@Toronto\u201d exhibition for Mercer Union <ref name=\":2\" />. McKay\u2019s art ultimately enabled her to meet with the Chief Coroner of the City of Toronto to discuss how to improve conditions for cyclists <ref>{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Jeff|url=|title=Coroner Will Meet With Cycling Groups Will Prepare Report Aimed at Reducing Deaths|date=August 13, 1997|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>.\n\nMcKay later developed an interest in [[Gender role|gender roles]] and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] notions of nature. In 2000, McKay developed \u201cThe Miss Mouse Project\u201d which consisted of a series of performances and video art <ref name=\":4\" />. ''The Miss Mouse Project'' was created around the character of Miss Mouse who was a large, pink, highly feminised anthropomorphic creature who featured in all performances and videos for the project [8]. The project was aimed at critiquing gender roles and identity as well as satirising anthropomorphic notions of gender <ref name=\":4\" />. ''The Miss Mouse Project'' toured across Europe and North America <ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nMcKay has demonstrated a keen interest in the [[Internet]] and the digital world more broadly <ref name=\":9\" />. McKay was an early adopter of the Internet and her website has enjoyed critical success, being labelled \u201ceasily the most lively and informative\u201d of Canadian artists by critic R.M Vaughan <ref name=\":5\" />. McKay has frequently explored the digitisation of the planet and humanity\u2019s relationship with the digital world <ref name=\":9\" />. In 2005, McKay created an installation artwork for the Case Study Gallery\u2019s exhibition \u201cWaypoint\u201d which included [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] coordinates and an offsite [[Geocaching|geo-cache]] <ref name=\":9\" />. McKay said she was interested in \u201cthe dystopian scenario that makes GPS work\u201d and her work aims to demonstrate how geography and location are digitized and monitored. <ref name=\":9\" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe theme to which McKay has most frequently returned is that of the relationship between art and science. McKay is especially interested in cognition, consciousness and social structures <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://canadianart.ca/features/on-the-brain/|title=On the Brain|last=McKay|first=Sally|website=Canadian Art|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> . Since completing a PhD on the relationship between [[neuroscience]] and art McKay has published articles in a number of academic journals about cognitive science and art, including \u201c''[[Canadian art|Canadian Art]]''\u201d and \u201c''RACAR''\u201d as well as contributing a chapter to Alfonso Scarzini\u2019s book \u201cAesthetics and the Embodied Mind\u201d <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":13\" />. McKay also explores the relationship between art and neuroscience throughout her many artworks. McKay is currently working on a project entitled \u201cThe Haunted Scanner\u201d with her partner Von Bark. For this project, which is funded by the Ontario Arts Council, McKay and Von Bark are building a brain scanner which will be used on audience members and McKay hopes this project will be an \u2018intimate audio-visual experience\u2019 <ref name=\":3\" />. McKay has stated that she believes art and neuroscience to be intrinsically linked because \u201cthe active ingredient in any art experience is the viewer\u2019s mind\u201d<ref name=\":11\" />. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n==Writing==\nSally McKay has received critical praise for her writing, which includes pieces published in newspapers, magazines, academic journals, exhibition catalogues and books. McKay\u2019s essay ''Donut,'' which was published in ''Susan Kealey: Ordinary Marvel,'' was described as \u201camong the best of the essays\u201d in the book <ref name=\":5\" />. In 2011, McKay\u2019s essay \u201cNature in the Network\u201d won the OAAG\u2019s Art Writing prize <ref name=\":8\" />. McKay is also widely recognized for her work and writing in ''Lola'', the magazine she co-edited and co-owned <ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />. Some of her writing is featured in published journals can be seen below. &nbsp; \n\n===Books ===\nMcKay was the co-editor, alongside Andrew J. Paterson, of ''Money Value Art: State Funding, Free Market, Big Pictures,''which was published in Toronto by YYZ Books in 2001 <ref name=\":2\" />. In 2015, McKay contributed to the book ''Aesthetics and the Embodied Mind: Beyond Art Theory and the Cartesian Mind-Body Dichotomy'' by Alfonsina Scarzini. She wrote an essay called \u201cNo Neuron is an Island: A Neuroaesthetic Inquiry into Omer Fast\u2019s Mimetic Interactions\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />. The source is an art historical analysis of Israeli artist Omer Fast\u2019s video work ''Talk Show''. McKay examines the existing neuroscientific consensus and literature on mirror neurons exploring how these would explain a human reaction to Fast\u2019s artwork <ref name=\":3\" />. Ultimately, McKay concludes that artwork can produce aesthetic experiences, which are inaccessible to the epistemological context of the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|FMRi]] Lab <ref name=\":3\" />. \n\n=== Magazine and Journal Publications ===\nIn 2019, McKay wrote a feature essay titled \"On the Brain: How we encounter art is more complex than neuroscience suggests\u201d which was published in the ''Canadian Art Magazine.'' McKay argues that art stimulates neuronal connectivity and provokes richer, more complex neural activity <ref name=\":13\" />. In her work and her writing, McKay explores neurological reactions to art. McKay focuses on the theories of neurologists and philosophers, and believes audiences must be empowered to embrace more open-ended, active modes of interaction. McKay believes that neurologically art provides a unique form of pleasure, which is not related to gratification or emotional reward <ref name=\":13\" />. &nbsp;\n\n=== Lola ===\n''[[Lola (magazine)|Lola]]'' was a visual arts publication that ran for seven years: between 1997 and 2003 <ref name=\":6\" />. Sally McKay launched the magazine, alongside her colleague, artist and writer, Catherine Osborne <ref name=\":6\" />. McKay and Osborne founded Lola because, in McKay\u2019s words, Toronto had \u201ca lot of art going on but no discourse\u201d <ref name=\":7\" />. The magazine was created in hopes of revamping the visual art scene in Toronto by creating an open forum for writers, artists and the general public to comment and critique exhibitions and art events within the city <ref name=\":6\" /> McKay co-edited ''Lola'' for the duration of its 16 edition run and under McKay\u2019s leadership it enjoyed a peak distribution of 12,000 <ref name=\":7\" />. &nbsp; \n\n''Lola'' did receive criticism from some of the Toronto art community who were angered at the magazine\u2019s policy of publishing unsigned critiques of exhibitions <ref name=\":6\" />. McKay insisted that this policy protected ''Lola''\u2019s contributors from being discriminated against by grant jury\u2019s for writing critical articles <ref name=\":7\" />. McKay admitted that ''Lola'' used \u201ca lot of tabloid sensationalism\u201d but maintained that this enabled the magazine to \u201cdiscuss contemporary art in a pop culture context\u201d and suggested that while \u201cthe art community hated us and everyone else loves it\u201d <ref name=\":6\" />.\n\nMcKay and Osborne both felt that arts publications should not rely entirely on government funding, and sought to make Lola a commercially successful magazine. Lola received a grant from the Canada Council for $10,000 but was also funded through advertisements. <ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lola'' enjoyed critical success and is considered to have been a significant aspect of the Toronto art scene <ref name=\":7\" />. ''Lola'' was considered a hybrid between a magazine and a zine <ref name=\":7\" />. &nbsp; \n\n==Curating==\nMcKay has curated a number of exhibitions in Ontario and Canada more broadly. In 2008, McKay curated \u201cQuantal Strife\u201d, an exhibition of three Ontario artists originally hosted at the Doris McArthur Gallery in Toronto but which ultimately toured across Canada including to Victoria <ref name=\":11\" />. The exhibition was a critical success and was described by the [[Times Colonist]] as an \u2018eloquent example of contemporary art practice\u201d and [[The Globe and Mail]] described McKay\u2019s curation of \u201cQuantal Strife\u201d as \u201ccharming, lucid, and very smart\u201d whilst [[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]] described the exhibition as \u201cflat out brilliant\u201d <ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. McKay has also held a three-week curatorial residency at Open Space in Victoria <ref name=\":8\" />.\n\nMcKay also worked as a curator at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery\u2019s 3rd Biennial in 2007. McKay curated an exhibition entitled \u201cWoodlot\u201d which featured art from 14 separate artists from the Waterloo area, working in a variety of media <ref name=\":14\">{{Cite news|last=Reid|first=Robert|url=|title=Knock On Wood; Nature Still Endures|date=July 28, 2007|work=The Record|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. According to McKay \u201cWoodlot\u201d explores \u201ccultivated landscapes\u201d as a theme and interrogates mankind\u2019s relationship and mastery over nature <ref name=\":14\" />. &nbsp;\n\n==Exhibitions and Projects==\n\n===Conference Presentations===\n\n* \u201cKnowing and Not-Knowing Matter,\u201d paper to be presented on the panel A Critical Conversation on Affect Theory, Neuroscience, and Art-Science Collaborations, College Art Association Conference, Los Angeles (February 2018)\n* \u201cArt and Embodied Learning,\u201d paper presented at Avatars of Human Creativity: Exploring the ArtSci connect: STEAM Conference, Cape Breton University (November 2017)\n* \u201cThe Haunted Scanner,\u201d paper presented at University Art Association Conference (UAAC) (2016)\n* \u201cThinking Matter: Speaking to the Spiritual,\u201d paper presented at the Lively Objects Symposium organized by Caroline Langille and Lizzie Muller at The Banff Centre (2015)\n* \u201cKristin Lucas\u2019 Refresh: Digital Media, Conceptual Art and Embodied Aesthetics\u201d (University Art Association Conference), OCAD University (2014)\n* Panel Chair, Questioning the Object\u2019s Fate at the Threshold of Art and Science, UAAC (University Art Association Conference), Concordia University (2013)\n* \u201cNature in the Network: Neuroaesthetics of FASTW\u00dcRMS\u2019 ''Donky@Ninja@Witch,''\u201d presented at UAAC (University Art Association Conference), Concordia University (2012)\n* \u201cArt & Agency: A Neuroaesthetic Analysis of ''Talk Show'' by Omer Fast,\u201d presented at Experimental Cultures, Mergers of Art and Science, Department of Art Graduate Symposium at University of Toronto (2012)\n* \u201cArt and the Brain: Explorations in Neuroaesthetics,\u201d presented at the conference Art, Science and the Brain: New Models of Learning for the 21st Century, co-organised by ArtSmarts and Social Innovation Generation at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto (2011)\n* \u201cArt & Agency: A Neuroaesthetic Analysis of ''Talk Show'' by Omer Fast,\u201d presented at SLSA (Society for Literature, Science and the Arts) conference, Kitchener, Ontario (2011)\n* \u201cScanning for the Gist: Colour and Form in the Art of Rebecca Diederichs,\u201d presented at UAAC (Universities Art Association Conference), Toronto (2008)\n\n=== Artist Talks ===\n\n* Visiting Scholar/Artist, Studio Graduate Seminar, York University, instructor: Barbara Balfour (2015)\n* Guest Lecturer, Friends of Art History Series, McMaster University (2014)\n* Guest Speaker, Creative Thinking Workshop for Graduate Students, McMaster Museum of Art (2014)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk and panel at Alberta College of Art and Design (2012)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, Criticism and Curatorial Practices class with Vid Ingelevics, Ontario College of Art and Design (2008)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, Media Research class with Paulette Phillips, Ontario College of Art and Design (2007)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, 4th-year seminar class in fine art with Kathleen Sellars, Queen's University (2007)\n* Visiting Artist talk and studio visits, University of Western Ontario, Toronto (2000) \u2022 Visiting Artist talk and studio visits, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (1998)\n* Public Lecture, \u201cThings,\u201d Judith & Norman Alix Art Gallery, Sarnia, ON (2016) \n* Panelist, How Are You Experienced?

This annual scholarship is awarded to graduate students recommended by their graduate programme director for academic excellence. McKay was awarded the prestigious SSHRC Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canadian Graduate Scholarship, which secured $35,000 worth of funding each year from 2010-2012.

McKay attended [[Medway High School (Arva, Ontario)|Medway High School]] in Arva, Ontario before studying at [[NSCAD University|Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] in Halifax, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, with an Art History Minor, in 1990 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://arthistory.gradstudies.yorku.ca/student-profiles-phd/|title=Student Profiles - PhD {{!}} Art History {{!}} Faculty of Graduate Studies {{!}} York University|website=arthistory.gradstudies.yorku.ca|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>. In the years following her graduation, McKay moved to Toronto where she established herself as a prominent artist and curator <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. In 2014, McKay completed a PhD. in Art History and Visual Culture from [[York University]], with a thesis entitled \u201cRepositioning Neuroaesthetics Through Contemporary Art\u201d <ref name=\":8\" />. Whilst at York University McKay was awarded the Joyce and Fred Zeman\u2019s Scholarship <ref name=\":8\" />. &nbsp;\n\n==Employment History==\n\n** Assistant Professor, School of the Arts, McMaster University, Contractually Limited Appointment (2014-2018)\n** Full Time Lecturer, School of the Arts, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, (2012-2014)\n** Sessional Instructor, School of Fine Arts and Music, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, (2011)\n** Sessional Instructor, Visual Art and Art History, Faculty of Fine Arts, York University, Toronto, ON (2009)\n** Editor, ''WADE'' a catalogue accompanying the a public art exhibition in Toronto wading pools curated by Sandra Rechico and Christie Pearson (2007)\n** Managing Editor at YYZ Books, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Toronto (2003-2004)\n** Founding co-editor/owner, ''Lola'' magazine with Catherine Osborne (1997-2003)\n\n==Art==\nOver the span of three decades McKay has produced art in an array of media including; performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, digital and installation art. McKay\u2019s performance art has been called \u201cintense\u201d and her 12-hour performance piece \u201cBedTime Fortune Story Teller\u201d for example, has been said to demonstrate her interest in pushing art to extremes <ref name=\":1\" />. McKay was an early adopter of digital art and has demonstrated a keen interest in digital surveillance. In a 2005 exhibition, McKay combined gifs and installation art, which at the time, was considered to be cutting edge multimedia work <ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|last=Vaughan|first=RM|url=|title=Cache Them If You Can|date=July 30, 2005|work=National Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. McKay has also produced work with a social purpose and has seen performance art as having the power to transform society <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite news|last=Stoffman|first=Judy|url=|title=Toronto Streets Claim Another Bike Rider|date=September 4, 1998|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. McKay combined performance art and advocacy in her 1998 work with Spirit of Spadina. McKay created a number of mass-protests and performances in the middle of Toronto\u2019s highways to draw attention to the number of cyclists killed in Toronto <ref name=\":10\" />. McKay has also used more traditional art forms, and has received critical praise for her drawings <ref name=\":1\" />. McKay\u2019s sketches of brain waves and her rendering of abstract neuroscientific concepts into sketches was a prominent aspect of her later art <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=Amos|first=Robert|url=|title=Quick Drawings Outrun Self-Censoring Consciousness|date=February 7, 2008|work=Times Colonist|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />. McKay placed a greater focus on teaching, research and academia as she began her PhD in 2014 but continues to produce art <ref name=\":2\" /> <ref>{{Cite news|last=Reid|first=Robert|url=|title=Knock On Wood; Nature Still Endures|date=July 28, 2007|work=The Record|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":8\" />. &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n==Teaching==\nMcKay has worked as an educator and professor at a number of Canadian universities. In 2009, McKay was a Sessional Instructor in the Faculty of Fine Arts at York University, while she was studying for a PhD there <ref name=\":8\" />. In 2011, McKay became a Sessional Instructor in the School of Fine Arts and Music at the [[University of Guelph]] <ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sallymckay.ca/|title=Sally McKay - Bio|last=McKay|first=Sally|date=2018|website=Sally Mckay|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. From 2012-2014, while she was still completing her PhD, she was also a Full Time Lecturer in the School of the Arts at [[McMaster University]] <ref name=\":12\" />. After graduating from York University in 2014, McKay worked as a full time university professor. From 2014-2018, McKay was an Assistant Professor at McMaster University in the School of the Arts <ref name=\":12\" />. Throughout her decade of teaching, McKay has led courses in an array of disciplines, notably: Art History and Visual Culture, Contemporary Art, Canadian Art, Neuroaesthetics, Digital Media, Multimedia and Installation Art and Performance Art <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/articles/hidden-gems-on-display-at-mills-library-if-you-can-find-them/|title=Hidden gems on display at Mills Library, if you can find them|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>. McKay has suggested her teaching philosophy positions student-directed learning as the core value of her teaching practice <ref name=\":12\" />. During her time at McMaster University McKay taught a range of courses that combined practice, theory and research in a number of disciplines <ref name=\":12\" />. Some of McKay\u2019s teaching areas include: Visual Art, Canadian Art History, Community Exhibitions, Applied Humanities and Studio Methods.&nbsp; McKay believes that the success of her courses is due, in part, to the careful structuring of lectures and assignments that encouraged students to value their own life experiences in relation to art practice and analysis <ref name=\":12\" />. \n\n==Themes==\nOver the course of her career McKay has produced works, which explore a number of different themes. In the late 90s, McKay created a number of artworks, which examined government safety campaigns, especially campaigns about the safety of cyclists and pedestrians in [[Toronto]] <ref name=\":10\" />. In 1998 McKay joined the Spirit of Spadina group, which sought to use performance art as a vehicle through which to pressure [[Toronto City Council]]<nowiki/>into adding a bike lane on the busy Spadina Avenue <ref name=\":10\" />. McKay organised and participated in a mid-road vigil in 1998 with Spirit of Spadina to commemorate the death of James Macmillan <ref name=\":10\" />. Between 1998 and 2000 McKay collaborated with Ben Lea Smith on \u201cSafety Animal\u201d a performance piece which attempted to engage with the public and satirise safety campaigns which position a burden of responsibility onto cyclists and pedestrians rather than cars and lorries <ref name=\":2\" />. \u201cSafety Animal\u201d was performed at the \u201cOffsite@Toronto\u201d exhibition for Mercer Union <ref name=\":2\" />. McKay\u2019s art ultimately enabled her to meet with the Chief Coroner of the City of Toronto to discuss how to improve conditions for cyclists <ref>{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Jeff|url=|title=Coroner Will Meet With Cycling Groups Will Prepare Report Aimed at Reducing Deaths|date=August 13, 1997|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>.\n\nMcKay later developed an interest in [[Gender role|gender roles]] and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] notions of nature. In 2000, McKay developed \u201cThe Miss Mouse Project\u201d which consisted of a series of performances and video art <ref name=\":4\" />. ''The Miss Mouse Project'' was created around the character of Miss Mouse who was a large, pink, highly feminised anthropomorphic creature who featured in all performances and videos for the project [8]. The project was aimed at critiquing gender roles and identity as well as satirising anthropomorphic notions of gender <ref name=\":4\" />. ''The Miss Mouse Project'' toured across Europe and North America <ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nMcKay has demonstrated a keen interest in the [[Internet]] and the digital world more broadly <ref name=\":9\" />. McKay was an early adopter of the Internet and her website has enjoyed critical success, being labelled \u201ceasily the most lively and informative\u201d of Canadian artists by critic R.M Vaughan <ref name=\":5\" />. McKay has frequently explored the digitisation of the planet and humanity\u2019s relationship with the digital world <ref name=\":9\" />. In 2005, McKay created an installation artwork for the Case Study Gallery\u2019s exhibition \u201cWaypoint\u201d which included [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] coordinates and an offsite [[Geocaching|geo-cache]] <ref name=\":9\" />. McKay said she was interested in \u201cthe dystopian scenario that makes GPS work\u201d and her work aims to demonstrate how geography and location are digitized and monitored. <ref name=\":9\" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe theme to which McKay has most frequently returned is that of the relationship between art and science. McKay is especially interested in cognition, consciousness and social structures <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://canadianart.ca/features/on-the-brain/|title=On the Brain|last=McKay|first=Sally|website=Canadian Art|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> . Since completing a PhD on the relationship between [[neuroscience]] and art McKay has published articles in a number of academic journals about cognitive science and art, including \u201c''[[Canadian art|Canadian Art]]''\u201d and \u201c''RACAR''\u201d as well as contributing a chapter to Alfonso Scarzini\u2019s book \u201cAesthetics and the Embodied Mind\u201d <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":13\" />. McKay also explores the relationship between art and neuroscience throughout her many artworks. McKay is currently working on a project entitled \u201cThe Haunted Scanner\u201d with her partner Von Bark. For this project, which is funded by the Ontario Arts Council, McKay and Von Bark are building a brain scanner which will be used on audience members and McKay hopes this project will be an \u2018intimate audio-visual experience\u2019 <ref name=\":3\" />. McKay has stated that she believes art and neuroscience to be intrinsically linked because \u201cthe active ingredient in any art experience is the viewer\u2019s mind\u201d<ref name=\":11\" />. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n==Writing==\nSally McKay has received critical praise for her writing, which includes pieces published in newspapers, magazines, academic journals, exhibition catalogues and books. McKay\u2019s essay ''Donut,'' which was published in ''Susan Kealey: Ordinary Marvel,'' was described as \u201camong the best of the essays\u201d in the book <ref name=\":5\" />. In 2011, McKay\u2019s essay \u201cNature in the Network\u201d won the OAAG\u2019s Art Writing prize <ref name=\":8\" />. McKay is also widely recognized for her work and writing in ''Lola'', the magazine she co-edited and co-owned <ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />. Some of her writing is featured in published journals can be seen below. &nbsp; \n\n===Books ===\nMcKay was the co-editor, alongside Andrew J. Paterson, of ''Money Value Art: State Funding, Free Market, Big Pictures,''which was published in Toronto by YYZ Books in 2001 <ref name=\":2\" />. In 2015, McKay contributed to the book ''Aesthetics and the Embodied Mind: Beyond Art Theory and the Cartesian Mind-Body Dichotomy'' by Alfonsina Scarzini. She wrote an essay called \u201cNo Neuron is an Island: A Neuroaesthetic Inquiry into Omer Fast\u2019s Mimetic Interactions\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />. The source is an art historical analysis of Israeli artist Omer Fast\u2019s video work ''Talk Show''. McKay examines the existing neuroscientific consensus and literature on mirror neurons exploring how these would explain a human reaction to Fast\u2019s artwork <ref name=\":3\" />. Ultimately, McKay concludes that artwork can produce aesthetic experiences, which are inaccessible to the epistemological context of the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|FMRi]] Lab <ref name=\":3\" />. \n\n=== Magazine and Journal Publications ===\nIn 2019, McKay wrote a feature essay titled \"On the Brain: How we encounter art is more complex than neuroscience suggests\u201d which was published in the ''Canadian Art Magazine.'' McKay argues that art stimulates neuronal connectivity and provokes richer, more complex neural activity <ref name=\":13\" />. In her work and her writing, McKay explores neurological reactions to art. McKay focuses on the theories of neurologists and philosophers, and believes audiences must be empowered to embrace more open-ended, active modes of interaction. McKay believes that neurologically art provides a unique form of pleasure, which is not related to gratification or emotional reward <ref name=\":13\" />. &nbsp;\n\n=== Lola ===\n''[[Lola (magazine)|Lola]]'' was a visual arts publication that ran for seven years: between 1997 and 2003 <ref name=\":6\" />. Sally McKay launched the magazine, alongside her colleague, artist and writer, Catherine Osborne <ref name=\":6\" />. McKay and Osborne founded Lola because, in McKay\u2019s words, Toronto had \u201ca lot of art going on but no discourse\u201d <ref name=\":7\" />. The magazine was created in hopes of revamping the visual art scene in Toronto by creating an open forum for writers, artists and the general public to comment and critique exhibitions and art events within the city <ref name=\":6\" /> McKay co-edited ''Lola'' for the duration of its 16 edition run and under McKay\u2019s leadership it enjoyed a peak distribution of 12,000 <ref name=\":7\" />. &nbsp; \n\n''Lola'' did receive criticism from some of the Toronto art community who were angered at the magazine\u2019s policy of publishing unsigned critiques of exhibitions <ref name=\":6\" />. McKay insisted that this policy protected ''Lola''\u2019s contributors from being discriminated against by grant jury\u2019s for writing critical articles <ref name=\":7\" />. McKay admitted that ''Lola'' used \u201ca lot of tabloid sensationalism\u201d but maintained that this enabled the magazine to \u201cdiscuss contemporary art in a pop culture context\u201d and suggested that while \u201cthe art community hated us and everyone else loves it\u201d <ref name=\":6\" />.\n\nMcKay and Osborne both felt that arts publications should not rely entirely on government funding, and sought to make Lola a commercially successful magazine. Lola received a grant from the Canada Council for $10,000 but was also funded through advertisements. <ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lola'' enjoyed critical success and is considered to have been a significant aspect of the Toronto art scene <ref name=\":7\" />. ''Lola'' was considered a hybrid between a magazine and a zine <ref name=\":7\" />. &nbsp; \n\n==Curating==\nMcKay has curated a number of exhibitions in Ontario and Canada more broadly. In 2008, McKay curated \u201cQuantal Strife\u201d, an exhibition of three Ontario artists originally hosted at the Doris McArthur Gallery in Toronto but which ultimately toured across Canada including to Victoria <ref name=\":11\" />. The exhibition was a critical success and was described by the [[Times Colonist]] as an \u2018eloquent example of contemporary art practice\u201d and [[The Globe and Mail]] described McKay\u2019s curation of \u201cQuantal Strife\u201d as \u201ccharming, lucid, and very smart\u201d whilst [[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]] described the exhibition as \u201cflat out brilliant\u201d <ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. McKay has also held a three-week curatorial residency at Open Space in Victoria <ref name=\":8\" />.\n\nMcKay also worked as a curator at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery\u2019s 3rd Biennial in 2007. McKay curated an exhibition entitled \u201cWoodlot\u201d which featured art from 14 separate artists from the Waterloo area, working in a variety of media <ref name=\":14\">{{Cite news|last=Reid|first=Robert|url=|title=Knock On Wood; Nature Still Endures|date=July 28, 2007|work=The Record|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. According to McKay \u201cWoodlot\u201d explores \u201ccultivated landscapes\u201d as a theme and interrogates mankind\u2019s relationship and mastery over nature <ref name=\":14\" />. &nbsp;\n\n==Exhibitions and Projects==\n\n===Conference Presentations===\n\n* \u201cKnowing and Not-Knowing Matter,\u201d paper to be presented on the panel A Critical Conversation on Affect Theory, Neuroscience, and Art-Science Collaborations, College Art Association Conference, Los Angeles (February 2018)\n* \u201cArt and Embodied Learning,\u201d paper presented at Avatars of Human Creativity: Exploring the ArtSci connect: STEAM Conference, Cape Breton University (November 2017)\n* \u201cThe Haunted Scanner,\u201d paper presented at University Art Association Conference (UAAC) (2016)\n* \u201cThinking Matter: Speaking to the Spiritual,\u201d paper presented at the Lively Objects Symposium organized by Caroline Langille and Lizzie Muller at The Banff Centre (2015)\n* \u201cKristin Lucas\u2019 Refresh: Digital Media, Conceptual Art and Embodied Aesthetics\u201d (University Art Association Conference), OCAD University (2014)\n* Panel Chair, Questioning the Object\u2019s Fate at the Threshold of Art and Science, UAAC (University Art Association Conference), Concordia University (2013)\n* \u201cNature in the Network: Neuroaesthetics of FASTW\u00dcRMS\u2019 ''Donky@Ninja@Witch,''\u201d presented at UAAC (University Art Association Conference), Concordia University (2012)\n* \u201cArt & Agency: A Neuroaesthetic Analysis of ''Talk Show'' by Omer Fast,\u201d presented at Experimental Cultures, Mergers of Art and Science, Department of Art Graduate Symposium at University of Toronto (2012)\n* \u201cArt and the Brain: Explorations in Neuroaesthetics,\u201d presented at the conference Art, Science and the Brain: New Models of Learning for the 21st Century, co-organised by ArtSmarts and Social Innovation Generation at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto (2011)\n* \u201cArt & Agency: A Neuroaesthetic Analysis of ''Talk Show'' by Omer Fast,\u201d presented at SLSA (Society for Literature, Science and the Arts) conference, Kitchener, Ontario (2011)\n* \u201cScanning for the Gist: Colour and Form in the Art of Rebecca Diederichs,\u201d presented at UAAC (Universities Art Association Conference), Toronto (2008)\n\n=== Artist Talks ===\n\n* Visiting Scholar/Artist, Studio Graduate Seminar, York University, instructor: Barbara Balfour (2015)\n* Guest Lecturer, Friends of Art History Series, McMaster University (2014)\n* Guest Speaker, Creative Thinking Workshop for Graduate Students, McMaster Museum of Art (2014)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk and panel at Alberta College of Art and Design (2012)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, Criticism and Curatorial Practices class with Vid Ingelevics, Ontario College of Art and Design (2008)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, Media Research class with Paulette Phillips, Ontario College of Art and Design (2007)\n* Visiting Artist\u2019s talk, 4th-year seminar class in fine art with Kathleen Sellars, Queen's University (2007)\n* Visiting Artist talk and studio visits, University of Western Ontario, Toronto (2000) \u2022 Visiting Artist talk and studio visits, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (1998)\n* Public Lecture, \u201cThings,\u201d Judith & Norman Alix Art Gallery, Sarnia, ON (2016) \n* Panelist, How Are You Experienced?

This annual scholarship is awarded to graduate students recommended by their graduate programme director for academic excellence. McKay was awarded the prestigious SSHRC Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canadian Graduate Scholarship, which secured $35,000 worth of funding each year from 2010-2012.

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi and [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Triepshi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's influence in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim local civilians were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and other communities like Ku\u010di came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's influence in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim local civilians were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

The cast of ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' appeared as recurring characters on ''Dynomutt'', assisting the Daring Duo in cracking their crimes. Originally distributed by Hanna-Barbera's then-parent company [[Taft Broadcasting]], [[Warner Bros. Television]] currently holds the distribution rights to the series.\n\n==Overview==\nMillionaire socialite [[art dealer]] Radley Crown (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]) and his mechanical dog Dynomutt (voiced by [[Frank Welker]], who got the inspiration for the voice from the Gertrude and Heathcliff characters of [[Red Skelton]]) enjoy leisure time in their base of operations in Big City, until alerted by the Falcon Flash. They then immediately dash to the Falcon's Lair (situated in Crown's penthouse apartment), where they switch to their secret identities, the Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder, respectively. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt receive the report via TV screen from the secret GHQ of secret agent F.O.C.U.S. One (voiced by [[Ron Feinberg]]), jump into the Falconcar and speed into the fray against assorted evildoers.\n\nIn a coup similar to the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, the first 10 minutes of ''Dynomutt'' ends with a cliffhanger wherein the Daring Duo, in the clutches of their foes, are subjected to a perilous fate which is resolved immediately after the commercial. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contains [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track created by the studio]].\n\nThe metallic mutt employs a system of miniaturized transistors which allow him to extend his limbs or neck and use them to perform extraordinary feats; however, none of them ever work properly. \"B.F.\" (as Dynomutt lovingly refers to him) is more Dynomutt's victim than his master, forever being hamstrung by the latter's insufferably clumsy mechanized mishaps, which often results in the Blue Falcon calling Dynomutt \"Dog Blunder\". Nevertheless, Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon, who is equipped with his own arsenal of supergadgetry, manage to get the situation well in hand.\n\n==Episode guide==\n===''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour'' (1976)===\n''The episode titles given reflect Hanna-Barbera studio records.

While the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt are on the trail of the mysterious Mr. Hyde, they encounter the Mystery, Inc. gang and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] (who are unaware that Mr. Hyde is a supervillain and not one of their typical \"spooks\"). In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''-fashion, they team-up with the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt (who happens to be Scooby's hero) to stop Mr. Hyde, who has threatened to turn the population of the entire city into \"Mr. Hydes\" unless he is proclaimed mayor. Fred and the others find a clue (which turns out to be Willie the Weasel's glove), and the Blue Falcon deduces that Willie is Mr. Hyde. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt have Mr. Hyde proclaimed mayor and pretend to turn themselves in so that Mr. Hyde will lead them to his secret lair and trick him into showing them the antidote to the Hyde formula. Willie the Weasel and his canine partner-in-crime \"Snitch\" manage to escape. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt head to the Mayor's mansion to stop Hyde from retrieving his stolen loot.

On June 4, 2009, ''Dynomutt, Dog Wonder'' returned to Boomerang and aired Thursdays through Sundays at 10am Eastern. But the show stopped airing on Boomerang due to the re-branding that happened on January 19, 2015, that also removed many other older shows.\n\n==Home media==\nAll 16 episodes of the first season were released to DVD in the ''Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour'' DVD set from Warner Home Video.\n\n==In popular culture==\nGary Owens and Frank Welker reprise their roles of Blue Falcon and Dynomutt in guest appearances in the ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode \"Dyno-Might\" (which was considered to be the darkest of the duo's adventures). Blue Falcon comes to Dexter when Dynomutt is heavily damaged during their fight with Buzzord (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]). Though Dynomutt is rebuilt by Dexter, Dynomutt ends up trashing his laboratory, causing Dexter to deactivate Dynomutt and create Dynomutt X-90 (also voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) who becomes a fanatical vigilante, using excessive and lethal force to deal with minor crimes such as parking violations, jaywalking, and littering. Dexter becomes Dexstar to help Blue Falcon stop Dynomutt X-90. When Dynomutt X-90 ends up trapping Dexter and Blue Falcon, Dexter stated that he created Dynomutt X-90 because the other Dynomutt was a goofy idiot [[sidekick]]. This causes Blue Falcon to reactivate the real Dynomutt while telling Dexter that \"He wasn't just a goofy idiot sidekick! He was a...go-go dog person!\". Dynomutt arrives and distracts Dynomutt X-90 enough for Dexter to deactivate him, with Dexter apologizing for underestimating Dynomutt. Blue Falcon and Dynomutt then thank Dexter for their help with the former noting to Dexter that \"It's a goofy idiot sidekick that makes a superhero super!\".\n\nDynomutt as a picture made a cameo in the \"Agent Penny\" episode of the ''[[Secret Squirrel#Super Secret Secret Squirrel|Super Secret Secret Squirrel]]'' segment of ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nGary Owens reprises his role of Blue Falcon in the ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' episode \"Johnny Makeover\". He, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Don Knotts]] redesign Johnny's show in a parody of ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''.\n\nBlue Falcon appears as a recurring character in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' TV series and once in the [[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (video game)|video game of the same title]] as a Spanish lawyer named Antonio de Rivera Garcia Azul Falc\u00f3n (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]). Dynomutt has also appeared in the two-part episode \"Deadomutt\" voiced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] with a Spanish accent.\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", with Dynomutt voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]] and Blue Falcon voiced by [[Kevin Shinick]].\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appear in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Heart of Evil\" with [[Frank Welker]] reprising his role of Dynomutt while Blue Falcon was voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. This depicts an origin where Radley Crown and his dog Reggie were security guards at Quest Labs. After a robot dragon attacks and injures Reggie's organic body, [[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Dr. Benton Quest]] rebuilds him as a cyborg dog. While Dynomutt retains his personality from the original series, the Blue Falcon is depicted as a gritty and violent vigilante (reminiscent of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[The Dark Knight Returns|\"Dark Knight\" version of]] [[Batman]]). Mystery, Incorporated ends up aiding Dynomutt and Blue Falcon when the robot dragon has attacked Crystal Cove City Hall. It then turns out that the dragon robot is a Dragon Battle Suit that was built by Dr. Zin in his plot to obtain the Quest-X Power Source and that his daughter Jenny was in a catatonic state in the Dragon Battle Suit since its last attack on Quest Labs. Dr. Zin wanted the Quest-X Power Source in order to heal Jenny. After Blue Falcon and Mystery Inc.'s fight with Dr. Zin's men, Dynomutt used some of the Quest-X Power Source to heal Jenny. Despite Jenny being healed, Dr. Zin and Jenny managed to get away and set their island base to self-destruct. After Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Mystery, Inc. escape before the base exploded, Blue Falcon vows to catch Dr. Zin someday.\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appear in another Scooby-Doo crossover, ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', with Frank Welker reprising his role of Dynomutt. This is the nineteenth film in the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise that is a direct-to-video film. The duo was redesigned in a movie within the film where the second Blue Falcon named Brad Adams (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) has a much darker, technologically advanced costume and Dynomutt was stripped down into a destructive, dark-looking robotic dog. The film also featured Owen Garrison (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) who was an actor that played Blue Falcon in the original TV series that he starred in and was bitter at the fact that Brad Adams was cast as the new Blue Falcon. Mr. Hyde (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) was the villain of the film and was the disguise of Jack Rabble (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) in a plot to steal the receipts from an armored car and frame Owen Garrison. By the end of the film, Owen Garrison was signed on to appear as the father of the second Blue Falcon for the film's sequel and Scooby-Doo was cast to play the role of the original Dynomutt.\n\nBlue Falcon and Dynomutt are set to appear in yet another Scooby-Doo crossover ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Blue Falcon voiced by [[Mark Wahlberg]] and Dynomutt voiced by [[Ken Jeong]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/mark-wahlberg-jason-isaacs-board-warner-bros-scoob-1202610831/|title=Mark Wahlberg & Jason Isaacs Board Warner Bros\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-05-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* Ongoing series ''Cartoon Network Presents'' #21 (May 1999) featured a story starring Dynomutt and Blue Falcon.

The cast of ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' appeared as recurring characters on ''Dynomutt'', assisting the Daring Duo in cracking their crimes. Originally distributed by Hanna-Barbera's then-parent company [[Taft Broadcasting]], [[Warner Bros. Television]] currently holds the distribution rights to the series.\n\n==Overview==\nMillionaire socialite [[art dealer]] Radley Crown (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]) and his mechanical dog Dynomutt (voiced by [[Frank Welker]], who got the inspiration for the voice from the Gertrude and Heathcliff characters of [[Red Skelton]]) enjoy leisure time in their base of operations in Big City, until alerted by the Falcon Flash. They then immediately dash to the Falcon's Lair (situated in Crown's penthouse apartment), where they switch to their secret identities, the Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder, respectively. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt receive the report via TV screen from the secret GHQ of secret agent F.O.C.U.S. One (voiced by [[Ron Feinberg]]), jump into the Falconcar and speed into the fray against assorted evildoers.\n\nIn a coup similar to the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, the first 10 minutes of ''Dynomutt'' ends with a cliffhanger wherein the Daring Duo, in the clutches of their foes, are subjected to a perilous fate which is resolved immediately after the commercial. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contains [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track created by the studio]].\n\nThe metallic mutt employs a system of miniaturized transistors which allow him to extend his limbs or neck and use them to perform extraordinary feats; however, none of them ever work properly. \"B.F.\" (as Dynomutt lovingly refers to him) is more Dynomutt's victim than his master, forever being hamstrung by the latter's insufferably clumsy mechanized mishaps, which often results in the Blue Falcon calling Dynomutt \"Dog Blunder\". Nevertheless, Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon, who is equipped with his own arsenal of supergadgetry, manage to get the situation well in hand.\n\n==Episode guide==\n===''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour'' (1976)===\n''The episode titles given reflect Hanna-Barbera studio records.

Fred and the others find a clue (which turns out to be Willie the Weasel's glove), and the Blue Falcon deduces that Willie is Mr. Hyde. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt have Mr. Hyde proclaimed mayor and pretend to turn themselves in so that Mr. Hyde will lead them to his secret lair and trick him into showing them the antidote to the Hyde formula. Willie the Weasel and his canine partner-in-crime \"Snitch\" manage to escape. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt head to the Mayor's mansion to stop Hyde from retrieving his stolen loot.

On June 4, 2009, ''Dynomutt, Dog Wonder'' returned to Boomerang and aired Thursdays through Sundays at 10am Eastern. But the show stopped airing on Boomerang due to the re-branding that happened on January 19, 2015, that also removed many other older shows.\n\n==Home media==\nAll 16 episodes of the first season were released to DVD in the ''Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour'' DVD set from Warner Home Video.\n\n==In popular culture==\nGary Owens and Frank Welker reprise their roles of Blue Falcon and Dynomutt in guest appearances in the ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode \"Dyno-Might\" (which was considered to be the darkest of the duo's adventures). Blue Falcon comes to Dexter when Dynomutt is heavily damaged during their fight with Buzzord (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]). Though Dynomutt is rebuilt by Dexter, Dynomutt ends up trashing his laboratory, causing Dexter to deactivate Dynomutt and create Dynomutt X-90 (also voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) who becomes a fanatical vigilante, using excessive and lethal force to deal with minor crimes such as parking violations, jaywalking, and littering. Dexter becomes Dexstar to help Blue Falcon stop Dynomutt X-90. When Dynomutt X-90 ends up trapping Dexter and Blue Falcon, Dexter stated that he created Dynomutt X-90 because the other Dynomutt was a goofy idiot [[sidekick]]. This causes Blue Falcon to reactivate the real Dynomutt while telling Dexter that \"He wasn't just a goofy idiot sidekick! He was a...go-go dog person!\". Dynomutt arrives and distracts Dynomutt X-90 enough for Dexter to deactivate him, with Dexter apologizing for underestimating Dynomutt. Blue Falcon and Dynomutt then thank Dexter for their help with the former noting to Dexter that \"It's a goofy idiot sidekick that makes a superhero super!\".\n\nDynomutt as a picture made a cameo in the \"Agent Penny\" episode of the ''[[Secret Squirrel#Super Secret Secret Squirrel|Super Secret Secret Squirrel]]'' segment of ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nGary Owens reprises his role of Blue Falcon in the ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' episode \"Johnny Makeover\". He, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Don Knotts]] redesign Johnny's show in a parody of ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''.\n\nBlue Falcon appears as a recurring character in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' TV series and once in the [[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (video game)|video game of the same title]] as a Spanish lawyer named Antonio de Rivera Garcia Azul Falc\u00f3n (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]). Dynomutt has also appeared in the two-part episode \"Deadomutt\" voiced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] with a Spanish accent.\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", with Dynomutt voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]] and Blue Falcon voiced by [[Kevin Shinick]].\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appear in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Heart of Evil\" with [[Frank Welker]] reprising his role of Dynomutt while Blue Falcon was voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. This depicts an origin where Radley Crown and his dog Reggie were security guards at Quest Labs. After a robot dragon attacks and injures Reggie's organic body, [[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Dr. Benton Quest]] rebuilds him as a cyborg dog. While Dynomutt retains his personality from the original series, the Blue Falcon is depicted as a gritty and violent vigilante (reminiscent of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[The Dark Knight Returns|\"Dark Knight\" version of]] [[Batman]]). Mystery, Incorporated ends up aiding Dynomutt and Blue Falcon when the robot dragon has attacked Crystal Cove City Hall. It then turns out that the dragon robot is a Dragon Battle Suit that was built by Dr. Zin in his plot to obtain the Quest-X Power Source and that his daughter Jenny was in a catatonic state in the Dragon Battle Suit since its last attack on Quest Labs. Dr. Zin wanted the Quest-X Power Source in order to heal Jenny. After Blue Falcon and Mystery Inc.'s fight with Dr. Zin's men, Dynomutt used some of the Quest-X Power Source to heal Jenny. Despite Jenny being healed, Dr. Zin and Jenny managed to get away and set their island base to self-destruct. After Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Mystery, Inc. escape before the base exploded, Blue Falcon vows to catch Dr. Zin someday.\n\nDynomutt and Blue Falcon appear in another Scooby-Doo crossover, ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', with Frank Welker reprising his role of Dynomutt. This is the nineteenth film in the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise that is a direct-to-video film. The duo was redesigned in a movie within the film where the second Blue Falcon named Brad Adams (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) has a much darker, technologically advanced costume and Dynomutt was stripped down into a destructive, dark-looking robotic dog. The film also featured Owen Garrison (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) who was an actor that played Blue Falcon in the original TV series that he starred in and was bitter at the fact that Brad Adams was cast as the new Blue Falcon. Mr. Hyde (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) was the villain of the film and was the disguise of Jack Rabble (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) in a plot to steal the receipts from an armored car and frame Owen Garrison. By the end of the film, Owen Garrison was signed on to appear as the father of the second Blue Falcon for the film's sequel and Scooby-Doo was cast to play the role of the original Dynomutt.\n\nBlue Falcon and Dynomutt are set to appear in yet another Scooby-Doo crossover ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Blue Falcon voiced by [[Mark Wahlberg]] and Dynomutt voiced by [[Ken Jeong]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/mark-wahlberg-jason-isaacs-board-warner-bros-scoob-1202610831/|title=Mark Wahlberg & Jason Isaacs Board Warner Bros\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-05-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* Ongoing series ''Cartoon Network Presents'' #21 (May 1999) featured a story starring Dynomutt and Blue Falcon.

But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.

But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.\"<ref name=Suttner/>\n\nOne of the dangers of dominant parties is \"the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.\"<ref name=Suttner/> However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.<ref name=Suttner/> In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as \"[[electoralism]]\" or \"soft authoritarianism\", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.\n\nIn some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-[[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]]. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.\n\nSub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].\n\n==Current dominant-party systems==\n{{Update|section|date=July 2010|inaccurate=yes}}\n\n===Africa===\n\n*{{flag|Angola}}\n** [[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], ''Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola'' (MPLA)<ref>{{cite book |title=Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2008 |last1=Mehler |first1=Andreas |last2=Melber |first2=Henning |last3=Van Walraven |first3=Klaas |year=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17811-3 |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOVYchAfCYYC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150404/http://www.bti-project.org/country-reports/esa/ago/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n** In power since independence, 11 November 1975; sole legal party, 1975\u201391\n** Formerly led by President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] (in office from 10 September 1979 to 28 August 2017) and now led by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]].\n** [[1992 Angolan general election|Presidential election, 1992]]: dos Santos (MPLA-PT) won 49.6% of the vote.

Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation.

Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\n* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.\n\nTo prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.  Then use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SAS congruence theorem]] for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using [[Thales's theorem]], see the animation at right.\n\nThe [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed. The chains can be used repeatedly whenever required.\n\n== In relationship to parallel lines ==\n[[File:perpendicular transversal v3.svg|thumb|236px<!--(as above)-->|The arrowhead marks indicate that the lines ''a'' and ''b'', cut by the [[transversal line]] ''c'', are parallel.]]\n\nIf two lines (''a'' and ''b'') are both perpendicular to a third line (''c''), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles.  Therefore, in [[Euclidean geometry]], any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other, because of the [[parallel postulate]].  Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.\n\nIn the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because [[Vertical (angles)|vertical angles]] are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent.

That is the point at which a segment from it to the given point is perpendicular to the line.\n\nLikewise, the distance from a point to a [[curve (geometry)|curve]] is measured by a line segment that is perpendicular to a [[tangent line]] to the curve at the nearest point on the curve.\n\n[[Perpendicular regression]] fits a line to data points by minimizing the sum of squared perpendicular distances from the data points to the line.\n\nThe [[distance from a point to a plane]] is measured as the length from the point along a segment that is perpendicular to the plane, meaning that it is perpendicular to all lines in the plane that pass through the nearest point in the plane to the given point.\n\n== Graph of functions ==\n\nIn the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of their [[slopes]] equals  \u22121. Thus defining two [[linear function]]s: {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''y''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>}}, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u22121}}. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\n\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub> = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if ''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub> = 0. This method is simplified from the [[dot product]] (or, more generally, the [[inner product]]) of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\n==In circles and other conics==\n\n===Circles===\n\nEach [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] is perpendicular to the [[tangent line]] to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.\n\nA line segment through a circle's center bisecting a [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is perpendicular to the chord.\n\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p''<sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n\n[[Thales' theorem]] states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.\n\n===Ellipses===\n\nThe major and minor [[axis of symmetry|axes]] of an [[ellipse]] are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.\n\nThe major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and to each [[latus rectum]].\n\n===Parabolas===\n\nIn a [[parabola]], the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\n\nFrom a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the [[Parabola#Intersection of a tangent and perpendicular from focus|other tangent line to the parabola]] is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's [[focus (geometry)|focus]].\n\nThe [[Parabola#Orthoptic property|orthoptic property]] of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.\n\n===Hyperbolas===\n\nThe [[hyperbola#Nomenclature and features|transverse axis]] of a [[hyperbola]] is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.\n\nThe product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.\n\nA [[hyperbola#Rectangular hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]] has [[asymptote]]s that are perpendicular to each other.

The [[perpendicular bisector]]s of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.\n\nThe [[Euler line]] of an [[isosceles triangle]] is perpendicular to the triangle's base.\n\nThe [[Droz-Farny line theorem]] concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's [[orthocenter]].\n\n[[Harcourt's theorem]] concerns the relationship of line segments through a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and perpendicular to any line [[tangent]] to the triangle's [[incircle]].\n\n===Quadrilaterals===\n\nIn a [[square]] or other [[rectangle]], all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A [[right trapezoid]] is a [[trapezoid]] that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.\n\nEach of the four [[maltitude]]s of a [[quadrilateral]] is a perpendicular to a side through the [[midpoint]] of the opposite side.\n\nAn [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral whose [[diagonal]]s are perpendicular.

However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\n\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub> = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if ''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>2</sub> = 0. This method is simplified from the [[dot product]] (or, more generally, the [[inner product]]) of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\n==In circles and other conics==\n\n===Circles===\n\nEach [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] is perpendicular to the [[tangent line]] to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.\n\nA line segment through a circle's center bisecting a [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is perpendicular to the chord.\n\nIf the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r''<sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p''<sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n\n[[Thales' theorem]] states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.\n\n===Ellipses===\n\nThe major and minor [[axis of symmetry|axes]] of an [[ellipse]] are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.\n\nThe major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and to each [[latus rectum]].\n\n===Parabolas===\n\nIn a [[parabola]], the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\n\nFrom a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the [[Parabola#Intersection of a tangent and perpendicular from focus|other tangent line to the parabola]] is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's [[focus (geometry)|focus]].\n\nThe [[Parabola#Orthoptic property|orthoptic property]] of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.\n\n===Hyperbolas===\n\nThe [[hyperbola#Nomenclature and features|transverse axis]] of a [[hyperbola]] is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.\n\nThe product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.\n\nA [[hyperbola#Rectangular hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]] has [[asymptote]]s that are perpendicular to each other. It has an [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] equal to <math>\\sqrt{2}.</math>\n\n==In polygons==\n\n===Triangles===\n\nThe legs of a [[right triangle]] are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe [[altitude (geometry)|altitudes]] of a [[triangle]] are perpendicular to their respective [[base (geometry)|bases]]. The [[perpendicular bisector]]s of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.\n\nThe [[Euler line]] of an [[isosceles triangle]] is perpendicular to the triangle's base.\n\nThe [[Droz-Farny line theorem]] concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's [[orthocenter]].\n\n[[Harcourt's theorem]] concerns the relationship of line segments through a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and perpendicular to any line [[tangent]] to the triangle's [[incircle]].\n\n===Quadrilaterals===\n\nIn a [[square]] or other [[rectangle]], all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A [[right trapezoid]] is a [[trapezoid]] that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.\n\nEach of the four [[maltitude]]s of a [[quadrilateral]] is a perpendicular to a side through the [[midpoint]] of the opposite side.\n\nAn [[orthodiagonal quadrilateral]] is a quadrilateral whose [[diagonal]]s are perpendicular. These include the [[square]], the [[rhombus]], and the [[kite (geometry)|kite]]. By [[Brahmagupta's theorem]], in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]], a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side.\n\nBy [[van Aubel's theorem]], if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length.\n\n==Lines in three dimensions==\n\nUp to three lines in [[three-dimensional space]] can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the ''x, y'', and ''z'' axes of a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tangential and normal components]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation |first1=Nathan |last1=Altshiller-Court |year=1925 |lccn=52-13504 |title=College Geometry:  An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York}}\n* {{citation |first1=David C. |last1=Kay |year=1969 |lccn=69-12075 |title=College Geometry |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |location=New York}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/perpendicular.html Definition: perpendicular] with interactive animation.\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constbisectline.html How to draw a perpendicular bisector of a line with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/constperpendray.html How to draw a perpendicular at the endpoint of a ray with compass and straight edge] (animated demonstration).\n\n[[Category:Elementary geometry]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n", "name_user": "Petrus3743", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eConstruction of the perpendicular:image size", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"}

In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14.

His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid except towards those employed under him during times of crisis. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14. Moby followed ''Play'' with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and [[downtempo]] music, starting with ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]'' (2002), ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]'' (2005), and ''[[Last Night (Moby album)|Last Night]]'' (2008). His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: ''[[Porcelain: A Memoir]]'' (2016) and ''[[Then It Fell Apart]]'' (2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of [[Harlem]] in Manhattan, New York City. He is the only child of Elizabeth McBride (''n\u00e9e'' Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor, who died in a car crash while drunk when Moby was two.<ref name=TI05>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/moby-i-am-a-messy-human-being-and-i-dont-have-a-problem-admitting-it-4325.html|title=Moby: 'I am a messy human being, and I don't have a problem admitting|date=March 5, 2005|work=The Independent|first=Nick|last=Duerden|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=TG14/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |title=Genealogy of Claire and Alex Jamison |publisher=Cujamison.home.comcast.net |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015831/http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=TG160521>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer|title=Moby: 'There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger'|date=May 21, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 25, 2018|first=Miranda|last=Sawyer}}</ref> His father gave him the nickname Moby three days after his birth as his parents considered the name Richard too large for a newborn baby.

Released in March 1991, it peaked at No. 10 in the UK in October and earned him national exposure there with an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\" /> Instinct capitalised on Moby's success with the late 1991 compilation ''[[Instinct Dance]]'' featuring tracks by Moby and his pseudonyms. The following year, Moby revealed that \"Go\" had earned him just $2,000 in royalties.<ref name=CT92/>\n\nThe success of \"Go\" led to increased demand for Moby to produce more music and to remix other artists' songs. He often arranged for the artist and himself to trade remixes as opposed to being paid for his work, which was the case for his mixes for [[Billy Corgan]] and [[Soundgarden]].<ref name=SPIN97/> The increased mainstream exposure led Moby to request a release from his contract with Instinct for a bigger label. Instinct refused, so Moby retaliated by holding out on new material. However, Instinct continued to put out records, mostly from demos, without his consent having previously copied many of his tapes and had the master rights.<ref name=THC95/><ref name=BS16/> This was the case for Moby's debut album, ''[[Moby (album)|Moby]]'', released in July 1992 and formed mostly of previously unreleased demos that Moby considered old and unrepresentative of the musical direction he had taken since.

In 2001, Chou released his second album, titled ''Fantasy'' (2001), which combined western and eastern music style. Since then his music has gained recognition throughout Asia, most notably in regions such as [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and in the Asian communities of Western countries such as [[United States|the United States]] and [[Australia]]. He has sold more than 30 million albums and has received numerous awards for his musical works. Chou has also written songs for other artists whilst working on his albums.<ref name=\"awardlist\" /> In 2003, he was the cover story of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] (Asia version),<ref name=\"Time\" /> titled New King of Asian Pop, acknowledging his influence on popular culture. He has since held six world tours, performing in cities around the world to more than 10 million people.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nChou debuted his acting career in the film ''[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]'' (2005); followed shortly by a starring role in the epic ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (2006). He has since starred in a number of films, becoming known to western audiences when he made his Hollywood debut in 2011 with ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'', starring alongside [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Christoph Waltz]].

In the third grade, he became interested in [[music theory]] and also started cello lessons. He was an only child and loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks. His favorite composer was, and still is to this day, [[Chopin]]. His parents divorced when he was 14 and he was teased by his classmates, which caused him to become reclusive and introverted. He had no friends and preferred to be alone, listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Tamkang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed a talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music and began to write songs.<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"gddm812\">{{cite book| last = Chou| first = Jay| title = Grandeur de D Major| date = 1 November 2004| publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu| location = China | isbn = 957-29371-4-6 | pages = 8, 12|language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChou was [[Conscription in Taiwan|conscripted for mandatory military service]] after graduating from high school with inadequate grades for university.

Without his knowledge, a friend entered both their names in a talent show called ''Super New Talent King'' in 1998. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as \"lousy\". Although they did not win, the show's host [[Jacky Wu]] \u2013 an influential character in Taiwan's entertainment business \u2013 happened to glance at the music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu then asked who wrote it, discovered Chou and hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]].<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"seeds\"/> for his then record company Alfa Music. Jay Chou then spent most of his time in Wu's studio learning music producing, sound mixing, recording and writing songs. Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines [[Music of China|Chinese]] and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], rock and pop genres. <!--  His songs written for artists such as Jacky Wu, Power Station, Landy Wen and Coco Lee became widely popular but he is still relatively unknown. There were no plans to make him a singer because his mentor Wu thought he was too shy and not good-looking.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} -->However Wu told Chou that he will help Chou to release an album after he wrote 50 songs and he will pick ten from there. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD album ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'' that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[hip hop music|rap]], classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly in Chinese-speaking regions throughout Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"jcbio\">{{cite web| url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html |title = King of the new generation \u5468\u6770\u4f26\uff1a\u65b0\u58f0\u4ee3\u4e4b\u738b| date = 8 January 2007 | accessdate = 2 June 2007 | publisher =sina.com.cn|language=zh}}</ref><ref name=\"starsrising\" /><ref name=\"revolutionary\" />\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2000 to 2003 ===\n\nIn 2000, under the recommendation of [[JR Yang|JR Yang (\u694a\u5cfb\u69ae)]], Jay Chou began to sing his own songs.  Chou launched his debut album ''Jay'' under Alfa Music in 2000. Chou arranged the compilation, harmony, and production of all the songs. The album combines R&B, hip-hop, and other musical styles. Among them, the hit song \"\u661f\u6674\" won the 24th China Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs.  The album was promoted heavily by [[Jacky Wu]] in the entertainment shows he hosted. Chou himself also appeared on a few television programs to promote the album. Chou was marketed as a talented singer-composer with a unique tune. His collaboration with [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] and [[Vivian Hsu (lyricist)|Vivian Hsu]] on the release brought about a few hits.\n\nAfter promoting his debut album, Chou returned to the studio for the next twelve months to record and produce his next album, ''Fantasy'', which helped him become an established star. This album was released in September 2001 and became a big hit, selling an estimated two million copies in Taiwan alone. ''Fantasy'' helped Chou secure ten nominations and five wins at the [[13th Golden Melody Awards]] in 2002. R&B hits such as [[\"\u7c21\u55ae\u611b\" (Simple Love)]] [[\"\u611b\u5728\u897f\u5143\u524d\" (Love before BC)]], which won Chou the Best Composer award, and \"\u958b\u4e0d\u4e86\u53e3\" (Can't Express Myself) are considered Chou's signature songs and are still sung in concerts today.\n\nChou's music has been a much-discussed topic across Chinese regions, because it differed greatly from mainstream popular Chinese music released at that time. His pieces combine ancient themes with futuristic ones, including things like space ships, all while employing graphic storytelling skills to evoke vivid imagery to his audience. His enunciation, or lack thereof, whether rapping or singing, was also critiqued when listeners often found that they could not decipher the words sung until they looked up the lyrics. Critics referred to his singing as \"mumbling\". This garnered a lot of attention and reporters often quiz Chou on his singing style. Chou defended this as his signature style to infuse the vocals with the music and \"make it blend\" well together. Chou also stated that he wants the listeners to look at the lyrics stating the lyrics written by Vincent Fang are very deep.\n\nChou's third album, ''The Eight Dimensions'', became another commercial success and is similar in style to his second. Another collaboration with Fang, ''The Eight Dimensions'' included songs that invoke imagery, Chou's \"mumbling\" style and mainly R&B tunes. The singer has sold over 750,000 copies of ''Fantasy'' as of 2002, throughout the region. In the same year, Chou held his debut concert tour ''The One''. There was also more crossover activity between Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as steadily increasing activity by Japanese acts in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClure|first1=Steve|title=The Year in Asia: Ongoing Piracy and Sliding Sales Trouble the Region, But New Artists in New Genres Begin to Make an Impact|date=28 December 2002|publisher=Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 114\u2013115.52\u20131|page=sec Year in Music 2002: YE\u201324}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 to 2005 ===\nIn 2003, Chou released his fourth album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' named after his own mother. After the release of this album, he attended the Golden Melody Awards for his previous album's nomination. The album ''The Eight Dimensions'' was nominated for 5 categories but won none. Chou didn't take this too lightly, as he wrote on his next album the song \"\u5916\u5a46\" (Grandmother) that he actually takes the Golden Melody Awards too seriously. Ironically, his then-current album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' would go on to win a Golden Melody \"Best Album of the year\" award in 2004.\n\n''Yeh Hui-mei'' was both a commercial and musical success. The album features songs on Mafia and drug lords \"\u4ee5\u7236\u4e4b\u540d\" (In the name of the father) which at first hearing was very unorthodox but displays Jay's creative writing and producing ability. This album can be seen as Jay's second milestone because it gained extremely positive reaction from both critics and supporters of his music. Jay also wanted to prove that he is a versatile artist and does not only write R&B songs, he ventured into more rock-flavoured tunes such as \"\u6674\u5929\" which was one of the most played songs of the year. This song gained widespread popularity and high school students started learning guitar to play the drift of the song's intro.\n\nIn 2004, his album ''[[Common Jasmin Orange]]'', released by Sony Music, excelled in the [[Greater China]] region. In 2004, his album Qilixiang, or Jasmine, released by Sony Music, excelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China Mainland.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite overwhelming piracy in Taiwan-which has reduced the recording industry to 5 to 10 percent from its heyday-as a Taiwan singer, Jay produced an album that sold a record 300,000 copies. In Hong Kong, his album surpassed local albums with sales of 50,000 units. In China the official figure reached 2.6 million units, a figure no other Chinese artist has attained. The World Music Awards in September 2004 held in Las Vegas acknowledged him as the most popular Chinese singer based on sales.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Anthony|title=western style, Chinese Pop: Jay Chou's Rap and Hip-Hop in China|year=2008|pages=69\u201380}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, his album ''Chopin of November'' continued this record of success with sales of 2.5 million units in Asia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Single released in 2019 ===\nHe recently made his chart comeback after a three-year hiatus with his long-awaited new single \"Won\u2019t Cry\".

The blowing \"China Wind\" in his music leads a new trend of Chinese pop music which involves a vast amount of traditional Chinese components, rather than simply following Western music format. Chou's China Wind is highlighted in his lyrics and the use of traditional musical instruments in his music. Lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] has worked with Jay Chou since 2000. Fang's work is featured by addressing Chinese traditional elements, such as poetry and [[Confucianism]]. His representative work \"Chrysanthemum Terrace\" ({{zh|links=no|c=\u83ca\u82b1\u53f0|p=juhua tai}}), released in 2006, shows a vast amount of cultural elements. In this work, Fang puts images which indicate certain traditional ideas to build an ancient monarchy setting. He uses [[chrysanthemum]] as a metaphor of love. In the line \"Chrysanthemums broken, scattered across the floor, your smile has faded\" ({{zh|links=no|c= \u83ca\u82b1\u6b98 \u6eff\u5730\u50b7 \u4f60\u7684\u7b11\u5bb9\u5df2\u6cdb\u9ec3}}).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/Taiwan-Jay-Chou/aa3d8a884eab8a9af6f0b70dffa28a57?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&current=3&orderBy=Relevance&hits=41&referrer=search&search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26startd%3D%26endd%3D%26orderBy%3DRelevance%26from%3D1%26allFilters%3DMusic%253ASubject%252CSINGERS%253AKeyword%252CTaiwan%253ALocations&allFilters=Music%3ASubject%2CSINGERS%3AKeyword%2CTaiwan%3ALocations&productType=IncludedProducts&page=1&b=a28a57 | title = Jay Chou on his new album, new look, and Korean pop music | date = 24 January 2013 | accessdate = 14 April 2015 | publisher = AP Archive}}</ref>\n\nHe performs in a rhythm and blues style, but within this western form, he has inserted Chinese melodies, themes, and rhythms. His song Dong Feng Po (East Wind, 2003) features a typical Chinese melody performed in R&B style; its instrumentation also creates a Chinese atmosphere with a Chinese pipa. In the lyrics, Jay expresses sadness and loneliness subtly, similar to traditional Chinese poetry.<ref>Fung, A. \"Western style, Chinese pop: Jay chou's rap and hip-hop in china\".

Despite rampant [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] issues in this region of Asia, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed 2 million sales.

He has held concerts in major venues such as the [[Acer Arena]] (Sydney \u2013 3 July 2009), [[HP Pavilion at San Jose]] (San Jose \u2013 31 December 2010), [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] (Los Angeles \u2013 8 January 2011), [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] (Las Vegas \u2013 25 December 2002), [[Rogers Arena]] (Vancouver \u2013 23 December 2010),<ref name=\"Time\" /> [[Shrine Auditorium]] (Los Angeles \u2013 18 December 2004),<ref name=\"2005shrine\">{{cite news | last = Quah | first = Junie | url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | title = Jay Chou in LA: An Incomparable Breakthrough | date = 2 March 2005 | accessdate = 2 June 2007 | publisher = UCLA Asia Institute | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218175742/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Galen Center]] (Los Angeles \u2013 24 December 2007), the [[Air Canada Centre]] (Toronto \u2013 18 December 2008) and [[Wembley Arena]] (London \u2013 17\u201318 March 2017).

His role in ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (limited release) marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story's plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress.

Since then his music has gained recognition throughout Asia, most notably in regions such as [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and in the Asian communities of Western countries such as [[United States|the United States]] and [[Australia]].

He has since starred in a number of films, becoming known to western audiences when he made his Hollywood debut in 2011 with ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'', starring alongside [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Christoph Waltz]].

In the third grade, he became interested in [[music theory]] and also started cello lessons. He was an only child and loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks. His favorite composer was, and still is to this day, [[Chopin]]. His parents divorced when he was 14 and he was teased by his classmates, which caused him to become reclusive and introverted. He had no friends and preferred to be alone, listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Tamkang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello.

Without his knowledge, a friend entered both their names in a talent show called ''Super New Talent King'' in 1998. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as \"lousy\". Although they did not win, the show's host [[Jacky Wu]] \u2013 an influential character in Taiwan's entertainment business \u2013 happened to glance at the music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu then asked who wrote it, discovered Chou and hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]].<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"seeds\"/> for his then record company Alfa Music. Jay Chou then spent most of his time in Wu's studio learning music producing, sound mixing, recording and writing songs. Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines [[Music of China|Chinese]] and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], rock and pop genres. <!--  His songs written for artists such as Jacky Wu, Power Station, Landy Wen and Coco Lee became widely popular but he is still relatively unknown. There were no plans to make him a singer because his mentor Wu thought he was too shy and not good-looking.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} -->However Wu told Chou that he will help Chou to release an album after he wrote 50 songs and he will pick ten from there. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD album ''[[Jay (album)|Jay]]'' that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[hip hop music|rap]], classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly in Chinese-speaking regions throughout Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"jcbio\">{{cite web| url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html |title = King of the new generation \u5468\u6770\u4f26\uff1a\u65b0\u58f0\u4ee3\u4e4b\u738b| date = 8 January 2007 | accessdate = 2 June 2007 | publisher =sina.com.cn|language=zh}}</ref><ref name=\"starsrising\" /><ref name=\"revolutionary\" />\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2000 to 2003 ===\n\nIn 2000, under the recommendation of [[JR Yang|JR Yang (\u694a\u5cfb\u69ae)]], Jay Chou began to sing his own songs.  Chou launched his debut album ''Jay'' under Alfa Music in 2000. Chou arranged the compilation, harmony, and production of all the songs. The album combines R&B, hip-hop, and other musical styles. Among them, the hit song \"\u661f\u6674\" won the 24th China Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs.  The album was promoted heavily by [[Jacky Wu]] in the entertainment shows he hosted. Chou himself also appeared on a few television programs to promote the album. Chou was marketed as a talented singer-composer with a unique tune. His collaboration with [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] and [[Vivian Hsu (lyricist)|Vivian Hsu]] on the release brought about a few hits.\n\nAfter promoting his debut album, Chou returned to the studio for the next twelve months to record and produce his next album, ''Fantasy'', which helped him become an established star. This album was released in September 2001 and became a big hit, selling an estimated two million copies in Taiwan alone. ''Fantasy'' helped Chou secure ten nominations and five wins at the [[13th Golden Melody Awards]] in 2002. R&B hits such as [[\"\u7c21\u55ae\u611b\" (Simple Love)]] [[\"\u611b\u5728\u897f\u5143\u524d\" (Love before BC)]], which won Chou the Best Composer award, and \"\u958b\u4e0d\u4e86\u53e3\" (Can't Express Myself) are considered Chou's signature songs and are still sung in concerts today.\n\nChou's music has been a much-discussed topic across Chinese regions, because it differed greatly from mainstream popular Chinese music released at that time. His pieces combine ancient themes with futuristic ones, including things like space ships, all while employing graphic storytelling skills to evoke vivid imagery to his audience. His enunciation, or lack thereof, whether rapping or singing, was also critiqued when listeners often found that they could not decipher the words sung until they looked up the lyrics. Critics referred to his singing as \"mumbling\". This garnered a lot of attention and reporters often quiz Chou on his singing style. Chou defended this as his signature style to infuse the vocals with the music and \"make it blend\" well together. Chou also stated that he wants the listeners to look at the lyrics stating the lyrics written by Vincent Fang are very deep.\n\nChou's third album, ''The Eight Dimensions'', became another commercial success and is similar in style to his second. Another collaboration with Fang, ''The Eight Dimensions'' included songs that invoke imagery, Chou's \"mumbling\" style and mainly R&B tunes. The singer has sold over 750,000 copies of ''Fantasy'' as of 2002, throughout the region. In the same year, Chou held his debut concert tour ''The One''. There was also more crossover activity between Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as steadily increasing activity by Japanese acts in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClure|first1=Steve|title=The Year in Asia: Ongoing Piracy and Sliding Sales Trouble the Region, But New Artists in New Genres Begin to Make an Impact|date=28 December 2002|publisher=Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 114\u2013115.52\u20131|page=sec Year in Music 2002: YE\u201324}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 to 2005 ===\nIn 2003, Chou released his fourth album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' named after his own mother. After the release of this album, he attended the Golden Melody Awards for his previous album's nomination. The album ''The Eight Dimensions'' was nominated for 5 categories but won none. Chou didn't take this too lightly, as he wrote on his next album the song \"\u5916\u5a46\" (Grandmother) that he actually takes the Golden Melody Awards too seriously. Ironically, his then-current album ''Yeh Hui-mei'' would go on to win a Golden Melody \"Best Album of the year\" award in 2004.\n\n''Yeh Hui-mei'' was both a commercial and musical success. The album features songs on Mafia and drug lords \"\u4ee5\u7236\u4e4b\u540d\" (In the name of the father) which at first hearing was very unorthodox but displays Jay's creative writing and producing ability. This album can be seen as Jay's second milestone because it gained extremely positive reaction from both critics and supporters of his music. Jay also wanted to prove that he is a versatile artist and does not only write R&B songs, he ventured into more rock-flavoured tunes such as \"\u6674\u5929\" which was one of the most played songs of the year. This song gained widespread popularity and high school students started learning guitar to play the drift of the song's intro.\n\nIn 2004, his album ''[[Common Jasmin Orange]]'', released by Sony Music, excelled in the [[Greater China]] region. In 2004, his album Qilixiang, or Jasmine, released by Sony Music, excelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China Mainland.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite overwhelming piracy in Taiwan-which has reduced the recording industry to 5 to 10 percent from its heyday-as a Taiwan singer, Jay produced an album that sold a record 300,000 copies. In Hong Kong, his album surpassed local albums with sales of 50,000 units. In China the official figure reached 2.6 million units, a figure no other Chinese artist has attained. The World Music Awards in September 2004 held in Las Vegas acknowledged him as the most popular Chinese singer based on sales.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Anthony|title=western style, Chinese Pop: Jay Chou's Rap and Hip-Hop in China|year=2008|pages=69\u201380}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, his album ''Chopin of November'' continued this record of success with sales of 2.5 million units in Asia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Single released in 2019 ===\nHe recently made his chart comeback after a three-year hiatus with his long-awaited new single \"Won\u2019t Cry\".

According to Jay's accounts of his childhood in interviews, his father had subjected his mother to daily verbal and physical abuse, often witnessed by traumatized young Jay.

The blowing \"China Wind\" in his music leads a new trend of Chinese pop music which involves a vast amount of traditional Chinese components, rather than simply following Western music format. Chou's China Wind is highlighted in his lyrics and the use of traditional musical instruments in his music. Lyricist [[Vincent Fang (lyricist)|Vincent Fang]] has worked with Jay Chou since 2000. Fang's work is featured by addressing Chinese traditional elements, such as poetry and [[Confucianism]]. His representative work \"Chrysanthemum Terrace\" (Chinese:\u83ca\u82b1\u53f0, pinyin: juhua tai), released in 2006, shows a vast amount of cultural elements. In this work, Fang puts images which indicate certain traditional ideas to build an ancient monarchy setting. He uses [[chrysanthemum]] as a metaphor of love. In the line \"Chrysanthemums broken, scattered across the floor, your smile has faded\" (Chinese: \u83ca\u82b1\u6b98 \u6eff\u5730\u50b7 \u4f60\u7684\u7b11\u5bb9\u5df2\u6cdb\u9ec3).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/Taiwan-Jay-Chou/aa3d8a884eab8a9af6f0b70dffa28a57?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&current=3&orderBy=Relevance&hits=41&referrer=search&search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26startd%3D%26endd%3D%26orderBy%3DRelevance%26from%3D1%26allFilters%3DMusic%253ASubject%252CSINGERS%253AKeyword%252CTaiwan%253ALocations&allFilters=Music%3ASubject%2CSINGERS%3AKeyword%2CTaiwan%3ALocations&productType=IncludedProducts&page=1&b=a28a57 | title = Jay Chou on his new album, new look, and Korean pop music | date = 24 January 2013 | accessdate = 14 April 2015 | publisher = AP Archive}}</ref>\n\nHe performs in a rhythm and blues style, but within this western form, he has inserted Chinese melodies, themes, and rhythms. His song Dong Feng Po (East Wind, 2003) features a typical Chinese melody performed in R&B style; its instrumentation also creates a Chinese atmosphere with a Chinese pipa. In the lyrics, Jay expresses sadness and loneliness subtly, similar to traditional Chinese poetry.<ref>Fung, A. \"Western style, Chinese pop: Jay chou's rap and hip-hop in china\". ''Asian Music, 39''(1), 69-80. 2008</ref>\n\nChou also uses traditional musical instruments, combining traditional Chinese elements of music with Western pop.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Collaborations ==\nChou began as a songwriter for other singers and continued this area of work even after he debuted his own career in singing. He has composed frequently for [[Jolin Tsai]], [[Landy Wen]], and occasionally for other singers such as [[Coco Lee]], [[S.H.E]], [[Vivian Hsu]], [[Leehom Wang]], [[Will Liu]], [[Valen Hsu]], and Hong Kong pop stars [[Edmond Leung]], [[TPE48]], [[Jordan Chan]], [[Edison Chen]], [[Karen Mok]], [[Leo Ku]], [[Eason Chan]], and [[Joey Yung]], as well as a one-time collaboration with Howard Su.

Despite rampant [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] issues in this region of Asia, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed 2 million sales.

He has held concerts in major venues such as the [[Acer Arena]] (Sydney \u2013 3 July 2009), [[HP Pavilion at San Jose]] (San Jose \u2013 31 December 2010), [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] (Los Angeles \u2013 8 January 2011), [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] (Las Vegas \u2013 25 December 2002), [[Rogers Arena]] (Vancouver \u2013 23 December 2010),<ref name=\"Time\" /> [[Shrine Auditorium]] (Los Angeles \u2013 18 December 2004),<ref name=\"2005shrine\">{{cite news | last = Quah | first = Junie | url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | title = Jay Chou in LA: An Incomparable Breakthrough | date = 2 March 2005 | accessdate = 2 June 2007 | publisher = UCLA Asia Institute | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218175742/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302 | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Galen Center]] (Los Angeles \u2013 24 December 2007), the [[Air Canada Centre]] (Toronto \u2013 18 December 2008) and [[Wembley Arena]] (London \u2013 17\u201318 March 2017).

His role in ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (limited release) marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story's plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress.
