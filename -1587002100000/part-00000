In the early 16th century the chakma people came from [[Arakan]] (Burma) due to repression and hostility by [[Rakhaine people]]. The [[Chakma people|Chakma]] are the single largest tribe, comprising half of the tribal population. The Marma people are the second largest tribe. They came from Burma when Arakan was conquered by Burmese king [[Bodawpaya]]. The tribal peoples emigrated from Burma due to repression by the Burmese king settled in the Hill Tracts with the consent of subedar of Bengal who is the representative of Mughal emperor. \n\n[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and early British records name the region ''[[slash-and-burn farming|Jum]] Bungoo'', ''Jum [[Mahallah|mahal]]'' or ''[[cotton|Kapas]] mahal''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geiger|first=Danilo|title=Frontier Encounters: Indigenous Communities and Settlers in Asia and Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yISAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|isbn=978-87-91563-15-7|page=487}}</ref><ref name=Ghanea>{{cite book|last1=Ghanea-Hercock|first1=Nazila|last2=Xanthaki|first2=Alexandra|last3=Thornberry|first3=Patrick|title=Minorities, Peoples And Self-determination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkupctPeacEC&pg=PA115|year=2005|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|isbn=90-04-14301-7|page=115}}</ref> In 1787, the [[East India Company]] made the region its tributary after battling tribal leaders.\n\n===British rule===\nThe use of the name ''Chittagong'' for this area dates to the 1860 British annexation of the region, bringing it under direct control of [[British India]].

Administratively, the Chittagong Hill Tracts were divided into three circles, namely the [[Chakma Circle]], the [[Bohmong Circle]], and the [[Mong Circle]], each presided over by a hereditary chief from the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] and [[Marma people]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.460846|quote=bohmong circle.|title=An Account of the Chittagong Hill Tracts|last=Hutchinson|first=Robert Henry Sneyd|date=1906|publisher=Bengal Secretariat Book Depot|language=en}}</ref> As of today, it is a semi-autonomous region within Bangladesh comprising the districts of Chengmi ([[Khagrachari District]]), Gongkabor ([[Rangamati Hill District]]), and Arvumi ([[Bandarban District]]).\n\n=== End of British rule ===\n{{see also|Radcliffe Line#Chittagong Hill Tracts}}\n\nThe last viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]], who considered the grant of independence to India as his act of crowning glory, was ambitious to achieve this \"superhuman\" task in record time. He said that before accepting the post of viceroy, he had told [[George VI]], who was his cousin: \"I am prepared to accept the job only on one condition. India must be granted independence by July, 1948 and I will not stay there a day longer\". Mountbatten came to India in March 1947 and this left him just about sixteen months to complete such a gigantic task. In reality, he achieved it in five months, on 15 August 1947, for which he was given much credit.\n\nOriginally, the award of the Boundary Commission was to be made public on 13 August. But Mountbatten was reluctant to make this public. According to [[Philip Ziegler]], the author of Mountbatten's official biography, the case of the Chittagong Hill Tracts was uppermost in Mountbatten's mind. Mountbatten \"foresaw an Independence Day marred by rancour, Nehru boycotting the ceremonies, India born in an atmosphere not of euphoria but of angry resentment.\" So Mountbatten decided to announce the award only on 16 August when the celebrations were over. As Zeigler writes, \"India's indignation at the award of the Chittagong Hill Tracts to Pakistan may have been a factor in making up Mountbatten's mind to keep the reports to himself till after independence\".\n\nMountbatten was himself surprised by the ferocity of [[Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s reaction to the issue. In his memoirs he wrote, \"The one man I had regarded as a real statesman with both his feet firmly on the ground, and a man of honour whose word was his bond, had turned out to be as hysterical as the rest. Candidly I was amazed that such a terrific crisis should have blown up over so small a matter. However, I have been long enough in India to realise that major crises are by no means confined to big matters.\"  Leonard Mosley in his book ''The Last Days of the British Raj'' puts it as \"a matter for Mountbatten's conscience\".\n\n=== Pakistani rule (1947-1971) ===\nThe nature and extent of the current rebellion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the context of resource appropriation, integration and stability in Bangladesh. It argues here that the crisis stemmed primarily from the socio-economic problems since the commissioning of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in early 1961. The intensity of the problem is beginning to increase with new industrialisation and economic policies for 'resource appropriation' for the benefit of the national economy with little or no participation by the local tribesmen. The insurgencies in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are but processes of politicisation and ethnicisation of the local population. It was suggested that solutions lie in the recognition of their ethnic identity and local autonomy rather than pursuing the then governmental policies which had tended to be more toward detribalisation during the Green Revolution.\n\n===Conflict===\n{{main|Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict}}\nThe conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts dates back to when Bangladesh was the eastern wing of Pakistan. Widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100, 000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to India.\n\nAfter The Liberation War, a convoy of Bangladesh army was ambushed by militants of the Hill Tracts. More than 90+ soldiers were killed and several of them were heavily injured. This was the first bloodshed in Hill Tracts. After this massacre, which was committed by the guerilla force [[Shanti Bahini]], Bangladesh deployed an army there. After some days, the Shanti Bahini started killing civilians in the Tracts. Many soldiers of the Bangladesh army were killed or injured by them.\n\nFollowing years of unrest, an agreement was formed between the government of Bangladesh and the tribal leaders which granted a limited level of autonomy to the elected council of the three hill districts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chittagong hill tracts : Commission rejects Bangladesh criticism|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/13113|work=UNPO \u2013 Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation|publisher=CHT \u2013 Chittagong Hill tracts Commission|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanging Bridge, Kaptai Lake.jpg|thumb|right|The Hanging Bridge, [[Rangamati Hill District]]]]\n\nThe 1997 [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] signed between the then [[Sheikh Hasina]] government and the [[Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti]] has been opposed by the opposition parties as well as a fraction of the tribal rebels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bangladesh: Militarization in the Chittagong Hill Tracts \u2013 The slow demise of the region's tribal peoples.

It is a special stage in the evolution from hunting and food gathering to sedentary farming. Mankind began to change its mode of life from food gatherer to food producer about 7000 B.C. by adopting shifting cultivation. Some form of shifting cultivation has been practised in most parts of the world, but more intensive forms of agriculture have subsequently replaced it.<ref>Rasul and Thapa, 2003.

If the present state of degradation is continued, most of the areas under shifting cultivation will be severely degraded<ref>Rasul, 2009</ref><!--which is 2009? --> and the future generations will face more difficulties to eke out their livelihoods on further degraded land. Although there is some scope for shifting cultivators to leave the degraded fields and move to other areas. It is estimated that on average eight hectares of land is necessary for the sustenance of a family in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. If this ratio is adopted, 1, 240, 000 ha land is required to sustain the present population; however, the total land available, excluding the reserve forest, is 928, 000 ha. Shifting cultivation, therefore, cannot fulfill even the subsistence requirements of the people. In such a situation, either large non-farm employment opportunities need to be created or more productive land-use systems need to be developed and adopted. Given the sluggish growth of the economy, there is limited scope for generating adequate non-farming employment opportunities in the near future. It is, therefore, imperative to replace the present shifting cultivation system with more productive and sustainable land use systems to enable people to secure their livelihoods.<ref>Rasul et al., 2004</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.iwgia.org/publications/search-pubs?publication_id=577 Bangladesh: Militarization in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. \u2013 The slow demise of the region's indigenous peoples.

He said that before accepting the post of viceroy, he had told [[George VI]], who was his cousin: \"I am prepared to accept the job only on one condition. India must be granted independence by July, 1948 and I will not stay there a day longer\". Mountbatten came to India in March 1947 and this left him just about sixteen months to complete such a gigantic task. In reality, he achieved it in five months, on 15 August 1947, for which he was given much credit.\n\nOriginally, the award of the Boundary Commission was to be made public on 13 August. But Mountbatten was reluctant to make this public. According to [[Philip Ziegler]], the author of Mountbatten's official biography, the case of the Chittagong Hill Tracts was uppermost in Mountbatten's mind. Mountbatten \"foresaw an Independence Day marred by rancour, Nehru boycotting the ceremonies, India born in an atmosphere not of euphoria but of angry resentment.\" So Mountbatten decided to announce the award only on 16 August when the celebrations were over. As Zeigler writes, \"India's indignation at the award of the Chittagong Hill Tracts to Pakistan may have been a factor in making up Mountbatten's mind to keep the reports to himself till after independence\".\n\nMountbatten was himself surprised by the ferocity of [[Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s reaction to the issue. In his memoirs he wrote, \"The one man I had regarded as a real statesman with both his feet firmly on the ground, and a man of honour whose word was his bond, had turned out to be as hysterical as the rest. Candidly I was amazed that such a terrific crisis should have blown up over so small a matter. However, I have been long enough in India to realise that major crises are by no means confined to big matters.\"  Leonard Mosley in his book ''The Last Days of the British Raj'' puts it as \"a matter for Mountbatten's conscience\".\n\n=== Pakistani rule (1947-1971) ===\nThe nature and extent of the current rebellion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the context of resource appropriation, integration and stability in Bangladesh. It argues here that the crisis stemmed primarily from the socio-economic problems since the commissioning of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in early 1961. The intensity of the problem is beginning to increase with new industrialisation and economic policies for 'resource appropriation' for the benefit of the national economy with little or no participation by the local tribesmen.

If this ratio is adopted, 1, 240, 000 ha land is required to sustain the present population; however, the total land available, excluding the reserve forest, is 928, 000 ha. Shifting cultivation, therefore, cannot fulfill even the subsistence requirements of the people. In such a situation, either large non-farm employment opportunities need to be created or more productive land-use systems need to be developed and adopted. Given the sluggish growth of the economy, there is limited scope for generating adequate non-farming employment opportunities in the near future. It is, therefore, imperative to replace the present shifting cultivation system with more productive and sustainable land use systems to enable people to secure their livelihoods.<ref>Rasul et al., 2004</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.iwgia.org/publications/search-pubs?publication_id=577 Bangladesh: Militarization in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. \u2013 The slow demise of the region's indigenous peoples.

The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of [[corporations]]. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly f\nom the life-cycle of a corporation.<ref name=armour>John Armour, Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, Mariana Pargendler \"What is Corporate Law?\" in ''The Anatomy of Corporate Law: A Comparative and Functional Approach''(Eds Reinier Kraakman, John Armour, Paul Davies, Luca Enriques, Henry Hansmann, Gerard Hertig, Klaus Hopt, Hideki Kanda, Mariana Pargendler, Wolf-Georg Ringe, and Edward Rock, Oxford University Press 2017)1.1 </ref> It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.\n\nWhile the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by [[shareholders|share ownership]], [[capital market]], and [[business culture]] rules differ, similar legal characteristics - and legal problems - exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how [[corporations]], [[investor]]s, [[shareholders]], [[Board of directors|directors]], [[employees]], [[creditors]], and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] such as [[consumer]]s, the [[community]], and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] interact with one another.<ref name=armour/> Whilst the term '''company''' or '''business law''' is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, '''business law''' often refers to wider concepts of ''commercial law'', that is, the law relating to commercial or business related activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or [[financial law]]. When used as a substitute for corporate law, '''business law''' means the law relating to the ''business corporation'' (or business enterprises), i.e. capital raising (through equity or debt), company formation, registration, etc.\n\n== Overview ==\nAcademics identify four legal characteristics universal to business enterprises. These are: \n*[[Separate legal personality]] of the corporation (access to tort and [[Contract Law|contract law]] in a manner similar to a person)\n*[[Limited liability]] of the shareholders (a shareholder's personal liability is limited to the value of their shares in the corporation)\n*[[Share (finance)|Transferable share]]s (if the corporation is a \"[[public company]]\", the shares are traded on a [[stock exchange]])\n*[[Delegation|Delegated management]] under a board structure; the [[board of directors]] delegates day-to-day management of the company to [[Executive (management)|executives]].<ref name=armour/><ref>[[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2; H Hansmann et al, ''Anatomy of Corporate Law'' (2004) ch 1 set out similar criteria, and in addition state modern companies involve shareholder ownership. However this latter feature is not the case in many European jurisdictions, where employees participate in their companies.</ref>\nWidely available and user-friendly corporate law enables business participants to possess these four legal characteristics and thus transact as businesses. Thus, corporate law is a response to three endemic opportunism: conflicts between managers and shareholders, between controlling and non-controlling shareholders; and between shareholders and other contractual counterparts (including creditors and employees).\n\nA [[corporation]] may accurately be called a company; however, a company should not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. In the United States, a company may or may not be a separate legal entity, and is often used synonymous with \"firm\" or \"business.\" According to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], in America a company means \"a corporation \u2014 or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union \u2014 that carries on industrial enterprise.\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 8th edition (2004), {{ISBN|0-314-15199-0}}</ref> Other types of business associations can include [[partnership]]s (in the UK governed by the Partnership Act 1890), or [[trusts]] (Such as a pension fund), or companies limited by guarantee (like some community organizations or charities). Corporate law deals with companies that are incorporated or registered under the corporate or company law of a [[sovereign state]] or their [[Administrative division|sub-national states]]. \n\nThe defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the shareholders that own it. Under corporate law, corporations of all sizes have [[separate legal personality]], with [[limited liability|limited]] or [[unlimited company|unlimited]] liability for its shareholders. Shareholders control the company through a [[board of directors]] which, in turn, typically delegates control of the corporation's day-to-day operations to a full-time [[Executive (management)|executive]]. Shareholders' losses, in the event of liquidation, are limited to their stake in the corporation, and they are not liable for any remaining debts owed to the corporation's creditors. This rule is called [[limited liability]], and it is why the names of corporations end with \"[[Ltd.]]\". or some variant such as \"[[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]]\" or \"[[Public limited company|plc]]\"). \n\nUnder almost all legal systems{{which?|date=May 2018}} corporations have much the same legal rights and obligations as individuals. In some jurisdictions, this extends to allow corporations to exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,<ref>e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Art.8, especially Art.(4)</ref> and they may be responsible for human rights violations.<ref>Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) has a very good discussion of the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.</ref> Just as they are \"born\" into existence through its members obtaining a [[certificate of incorporation]], they can \"die\" when they lose money into [[insolvency]]. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offences, such as [[corporate fraud]] and [[corporate manslaughter]].<ref>e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]</ref>\n\n==Corporate Law Background==\nIn order to understand the role corporate law plays within commercial law, it is useful to understand the historical development of the corporation, and the development of modern company law.\n\n===History of the Corporation===\n{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Corporation#History|l1=History of corporations}}\n[[Image:South Sea Bubble.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Hogarth|Hogarthian]] image of the [[South Sea Bubble]], by [[Edward Matthew Ward]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nAlthough some forms of companies are thought to have existed during [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], the closest recognizable ancestors of the modern company did not appear until the 16th century. With increasing international trade, [[Royal charter]]s were granted in Europe (notably in [[England]] and [[Holland]]) to merchant adventurers.  The Royal charters usually conferred special privileges on the trading company (including, usually, some form of [[monopoly]]).  Originally, traders in these entities traded stock on their own account, but later the members came to operate on joint account and with joint stock, and the new [[Joint stock company]] was born.<ref>In England the first joint stock company was the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], which received its charter in 1600.  The [[Dutch East India Company]] received its charter in 1602, but is generally recognized as the first company in the world to issue joint stock. Not coincidentally, the two companies were competitors.</ref>\n\nEarly companies were purely economic ventures; it was only a belatedly established benefit of holding joint stock that the company's stock could not be seized for the debts of any individual member.<ref>In England, see ''Edmunds v Brown Tillard'' (1668) 1 Lev 237 and ''Salmon v The Hamborough Co'' (1671) 1 Ch Cas 204</ref> The development of company law in Europe was hampered by two notorious \"bubbles\" (the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] in England and the [[Tulip mania|Tulip Bulb Bubble]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]) in the 17th century, which set the development of companies in the two leading jurisdictions back by over a century in popular estimation.\n\n===Modern company law===\n[[File:Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|right|\"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock\", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]\nCompanies, almost inevitably, returned to the forefront of commerce, although in England to circumvent the [[Bubble Act]] 1720 investors had reverted to trading the stock of unincorporated associations, until it was repealed in 1825.{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}} However, the cumbersome process of obtaining Royal charters was simply insufficient to keep up with demand.  In England there was a lively trade in the charters of defunct companies.  However, procrastination amongst the legislature meant that in the United Kingdom it was not until the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]] that the first equivalent of modern companies, formed by registration, appeared. Soon after came the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], which in the event of a company's bankruptcy limited the liability of all shareholders to the amount of capital they had invested.\n\nThe beginning of modern company law came when the two pieces of legislation were codified under the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]] at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]]. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.\n\nIn a December 2006 article, ''[[The Economist]]'' identified the development of the joint stock company as one of the key reasons why Western commerce moved ahead of its rivals in the Middle East in post-[[renaissance]] era.<ref>\"Long ago, the region's failure to develop joint-stock companies was one reason why it fell behind the West.\" from [http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RQTPDDJ&login=Y&CFID=104408993&CFTOKEN=3fd5f61-d9f0ee11-3443-43d4-b694-1160bf9d5298 \"Think local\"]. ''The Economist''.</ref>{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Corporate Structure==\n{{Main article|Corporation}}\n{{see|Types of business entity}}\nThe law of business organizations originally derived from the [[common law]] of [[England]], and has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law countries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Corporation]]\n* [[Limited company]]\n* [[Unlimited company]]\n* [[Limited liability partnership]]\n* [[Limited partnership]]\n* [[Not-for-profit corporation]]\n* [[Company limited by guarantee]]\n* [[Partnership]]\n* [[Sole Proprietorship]]\nThe proprietary limited company is a statutory business form in several countries, including [[Australia]]. Many countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although there are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the [[limited liability company]] (LLC) and the [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP) in the United States. Other types of business organizations, such as [[cooperative]]s, [[credit unions]] and publicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the [[profit maximization]] mandate of business corporations.\n\nThere are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:\n* ''a [[company limited by guarantee]]''. Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[Liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company .\n* ''a company limited by guarantee with a share capital''. A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.\n* ''a [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]''. The most common form of company used for business ventures.\n* ''an [[Unlimited Company|unlimited company]]'' either with or without a share capital. This is a hybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but where the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal [[liquidation]].\nThere are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business organizations which may be formed in various countries and [[jurisdiction]]s throughout the world.\n\n===Corporate legal personality===\n{{main|Piercing the corporate veil}}\nOne of the key legal features of corporations are their separate legal personality, also known as \"personhood\" or being \"artificial persons\". However, the separate legal personality was not confirmed under [[English law]] until 1895 by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]''<ref>''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' [1897] AC 22.</ref> Separate legal personality often has [[unintended consequence]]s, particularly in relation to smaller, [[family company|family companies]]. In ''[[B v. B]]'' [1978] Fam 181 it was held that a [[discovery (law)|discovery order]] obtained by a wife against her husband was not effective against the husband's company as it was not named in the order and was separate and distinct from him.<ref>Although it did attach to documents within the husband's custody or control.</ref> And in ''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]''<ref>''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]'' [1925] AC 619</ref> a claim under an insurance policy failed where the insured had transferred timber from his name into the name of a company wholly owned by him, and it was subsequently destroyed in a fire; as the property now belonged to the company and not to him, he no longer had an \"insurable interest\" in it and his claim failed.\n\nSeparate legal personality allows corporate groups flexibility in relation to tax planning, and management of overseas liability. For instance in ''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]''<ref>''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]'' [1990] Ch 433</ref> it was held that victims of asbestos poisoning at the hands of an American subsidiary could not sue the English parent in tort. Whilst academic discussion highlights certain specific situations where courts are generally prepared to \"[[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]]\", to look directly at, and impose liability directly on the individuals behind the company; the actually practice of piercing the corporate veil is, at English law, non-existent.<ref>Goode ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn, Sweet & Maxwell 2013)</ref>  However, the court will look beyond the corporate form where the corporation is a sham or perpetuating a fraud. The most commonly cited examples are:\n* where the company is a mere fa\u00e7ade\n* where the company is effectively just the agent of its members or controllers\n* where a representative of the company has taken some personal responsibility for a statement or action<ref>''Williams v Natural Life'' [1998] 1 WLR 830</ref>\n* where the company is engaged in fraud or other criminal wrongdoing\n* where the natural interpretation of a contract or statute is as a reference to the corporate group and not the individual company\n* where permitted by statute (for example, many jurisdictions provide for shareholder liability where a company breaches [[Environmental law|environmental protection laws]])\n\n====Capacity and powers====\n{{see also|Corporate benefit}}\nHistorically,  because companies are artificial persons created by operation of law, the law prescribed what the company could and could not do.  Usually this was an expression of the commercial purpose which the company was formed for, and came to be referred to as the company's ''objects'', and the extent of the objects are referred to as the company's [[capacity (law)|capacity]].  If an activity fell outside the company's capacity it was said to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' and [[void (law)|void]].\n\nBy way of distinction, the organs of the company were expressed to have various ''corporate powers''.  If the objects were the things that the company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them.  Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty.<ref>See the frustration expressed by the House of Lords in ''[[Cotman v. Brougham]]'' [1918] AC 514</ref> Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the things that a natural person could do, and power to do it in any way that a natural person could do it.\n\nHowever, references to corporate capacity and powers have not quite been consigned to the dustbin of legal history.  In many jurisdictions, directors can still be liable to their shareholders if they cause the company to engage in businesses outside its objects, even if the transactions are still valid as between the company and the third party.  And many jurisdictions also still permit transactions to be challenged for lack of \"[[corporate benefit]]\", where the relevant transaction has no prospect of being for the commercial benefit of the company or its shareholders.\n\nAs artificial persons, companies can only act through human agents. The main agent who deals with the company's management and business is the [[board of directors]], but in many jurisdictions other officers can be appointed too.  The board of directors is normally elected by the members, and the other officers are normally appointed by the board. These agents enter into contracts on behalf of the company with third parties.\n\nAlthough the company's agents owe duties to the company (and, indirectly, to the shareholders) to exercise those powers for a proper purpose, generally speaking third parties' rights are not impugned if it transpires that the officers were acting improperly.  Third parties are entitled to rely on the [[ostensible authority]] of agents held out by the company to act on its behalf.  A line of common law cases reaching back to ''[[Royal British Bank v Turquand]]'' established in common law that third parties were entitled to assume that the internal management of the company was being conducted properly, and the rule has now been codified into statute in most countries.\n\nAccordingly, companies will normally be liable for all the act and omissions of their officers and agents.  This will include almost all [[torts]], but the law relating to [[corporate manslaughter|crimes committed by companies]] is complex, and varies significantly between countries.\n\n====Corporate crime====\n{{main|Corporate liability|Corporate crime}}\n*[[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]\n\n===Corporate governance===\n{{main|Corporate governance}}\nCorporate governance is primarily the study of the power relations among a corporation's senior executives, its [[board of directors]] and those who elect them ([[shareholders]] in the \"[[general meeting]]\" and [[employees]]), as well as other stakeholders, such as [[creditors]], [[consumer]]s, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the [[community]] at large.<ref> Lin, Tom C. W., [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3294317 Incorporating Social Activism] (December 1, 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018) </ref> One of the main differences between different countries in the internal form of companies is between a two-tier and a one tier board. The United Kingdom, the United States, and most Commonwealth countries have single unified boards of directors. In Germany, companies have two tiers, so that shareholders (and employees) elect a \"supervisory board\", and then the supervisory board chooses the \"management board\". There is the option to use two tiers in France, and in the new European Companies ([[Societas Europaea]]).\n\nRecent literature, especially from the United States, has begun to discuss corporate governance in the terms of [[management science]]. While post-war discourse centred on how to achieve effective \"corporate democracy\" for shareholders or other stakeholders, many scholars have shifted to discussing the law in terms of [[principal\u2013agent problem]]s. On this view, the basic issue of corporate law is that when a \"principal\" party delegates his property (usually the shareholder's capital, but also the employee's labour) into the control of an \"agent\" (i.e. the director of the company) there is the possibility that the agent will act in his own interests, be \"opportunistic\", rather than fulfill the wishes of the principal. Reducing the risks of this opportunism, or the \"agency cost\", is said to be central to the goal of corporate law.\n\n\n====Constitution====\n{{main|Corporate constitution}}\n[[Image:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]], dating from 7 November 1623, for the amount of 2,400 [[Dutch gulden|florins]]]]\nThe rules for corporations derive from two sources. These are the country's statutes: in the US, usually the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] (DGCL); in the UK, the [[Companies Act 2006]] (CA 2006); in Germany, the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/aktg/ Aktiengesetz  (AktG)] and the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg/index.html Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung (GmbH-Gesetz, GmbHG).] The law will set out which rules are mandatory, and which rules can be derogated from. Examples of important rules which cannot be derogated from would usually include how to fire the [[board of directors]], what duties directors owe to the company or when a company must be dissolved as it approaches bankruptcy. Examples of rules that members of a company would be allowed to change and choose could include, what kind of procedure [[general meeting]]s should follow, when dividends get paid out, or how many members (beyond a minimum set out in the law) can amend the constitution.  Usually, the statute will set out [[Model Articles|model articles]], which the corporation's constitution will be assumed to have if it is silent on a bit of particular procedure.\n\nThe United States, and a few other common law countries, split the corporate constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The [[memorandum of Association]] (or [[articles of incorporation]]) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. \"this company makes automobiles\") and specifies the [[authorised share capital]] of the company. The [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] (or [[bylaw|by-laws]]) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails<ref>''[[Ashbury v. Watson]]'' (1885) 30 Ch D 376</ref> and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the [[charter]].\n\nIt is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as ''[[shareholders' agreement]]s'', whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way.  Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.<ref>''Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley'' [1924] NZLR 561</ref>  One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of ''[[voting trust]]s'', although these are relatively uncommon outside the [[United States]] and certain [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]]. Some jurisdictions consider the [[company seal]] to be a part of the \"constitution\" (in the loose sense of the word) of the company, but the requirement for a seal has been abrogated by legislation in most countries.\n\n====Balance of power====\n[[Image:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf Berle]] in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' argued that the separation of control of companies from the investors who were meant to own them endangered the American economy and led to a mal-[[distribution of wealth]].]]\nThe most important rules for corporate governance are those concerning the balance of power between the [[board of directors]] and the members of the company. Authority is given or \"delegated\" to the board to manage the company for the success of the investors. Certain specific decision rights are often reserved for shareholders, where their interests could be fundamentally affected. There are necessarily rules on when directors can be removed from office and replaced. To do that, meetings need to be called to vote on the issues. How easily the constitution can be amended and by whom necessarily affects the relations of power.\n\nIt is a principle of corporate law that the directors of a company have the right to manage. This is expressed in statute in the [[Delaware General Corporation Law|DGCL]], where \u00a7141(a)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml#TopOfPage|title=TITLE  8 - CHAPTER 1.

Directors and Officers|website=delcode.delaware.gov}}</ref> states,\n\n<blockquote>(a) The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.</blockquote>\n\nIn [[Germany]], \u00a776 [[Aktiengesellschaft|AktG]] says the same for the management board, while under \u00a7111 AktG the supervisory board's role is stated to be to \"oversee\" (''\u00fcberwachen''). In the [[United Kingdom]], the right to manage is not laid down in law, but is found in Part.2 of the [[Model Articles]]. This means it is a default rule, which companies can opt out of (s.20 [[Companies Act 2006|CA 2006]]) by reserving powers to members, although companies rarely do. UK law specifically reserves shareholders right and duty to approve \"substantial non cash asset transactions\" (s.190 CA 2006), which means those over 10% of company value, with a minimum of \u00a35,000 and a maximum of \u00a3100,000.<ref>See also, [[Listing Rule]] 10 for public companies, setting out a scale of transactions requiring shareholder approval and disclosure.</ref> Similar rules, though much less stringent, exist in \u00a7271 DGCL<ref>Shareholders must approve sale of \"all or substantially all assets\", held in ''Gimbel'' (1974) to be those \"qualitatively vital to the existence and purpose\" of the corporation; which in ''[[Katz v. Bregman]]'' (1981) was held to include assets under 50% of the company's value</ref> and through case law in Germany under the so-called ''[[Holzm\u00fcller-Doktrin]]''.<ref>The ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]'' held that shareholders must approve a sale of assets amounting to 80% of the company's value</ref>\n\nProbably the most fundamental guarantee that directors will act in the members' interests is that they can easily be sacked. During the [[Great Depression]], two [[Harvard University|Harvard]] scholars, [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]] wrote ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006<ref>c.f. ''[[Bushell v. Faith]]'', and query whether the decision would still be decided the same way.</ref> Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has been a year since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where employee participation creates the need for greater boardroom stability, \u00a784(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (''ein wichtiger Grund'') though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. \u00a7122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. \u00a7141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is \"classified\", meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director's autonomy from shareholders is seen further in \u00a7216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and \u00a7211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it.<ref>See also, SEC 13d-5, dating from times when groups of investors were considered potential [[cartel]]s, saying any 5% shareholder voting block must register with the Federal financial authority, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]].</ref> The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and \u00a7242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (\u00a7179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).<ref>Though the Constitution may allow particular provisions to be further \"entrenched\", s.22; Furthermore, Art.3 of the Model Articles allows 75% of members in general meeting to give the directors specific instructions.</ref>\n\n===Director duties===\n{{main|Board of directors|Directors' duties}}\nIn most jurisdictions, directors owe [[fiduciary|strict duties of good faith]], as well as duties of care and skill, to safeguard the interests of the company and the members. In many developed countries outside the English speaking world, company boards are appointed as representatives of both shareholders and employees to \"[[Codetermination|codetermine]]\" company strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume2/issue2/MertensSchanze2J.Comp.Corp.L.&Sec.Reg.75(1979).pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Comparative Corporate Law and Securities Regulation|volume=2|date=1979|pages=75-88|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|title=The German Codetermination Act OF 1976|author1=Hans-Joachim Mertens|author2=Erich Schanze}}</ref> Corporate law is often divided into [[corporate governance]] (which concerns the various power relations within a corporation) and [[corporate finance]] (which concerns the rules on how capital is used).\nDirectors also owe strict duties not to permit any [[conflict of interest]] or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.  This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.  In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that, {{Quote frame|\"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal.  And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into...\"}} However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle.<ref>Goode ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn Sweet & Maxwell, 2013) 214</ref>  It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution. \nThe standard of skill and care that a director owes is usually described as acquiring and maintaining sufficient knowledge and understanding of the company's business to enable him to properly discharge his duties. This duty enables the company to seek compensation from its director if it can be proved that a director has not shown reasonable skill or care which in turn has caused the company to incur a loss.<ref>''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]'' [1983] Ch 258</ref> In many jurisdictions, where a company continues to trade despite foreseeable [[bankruptcy]], the directors can be forced to account for trading losses personally. Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose.  For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but in order to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.<ref>''[[Harlowe's Nominees Pty v. Woodside]]'' (1968) 121 CLR 483 (Aust HC)</ref>\n\n==Company law theory==\n\n[[Ronald Coase]] has pointed out, all business organizations represent an attempt to avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide [[limited liability]] to both members of the organization and external investors. Business organizations originated with [[Agency (law)|agency law]], which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behaviour.\n\n==Litigation==\n{{main|Derivative suit|Unfair prejudice}}\nMembers of a company generally have rights against each other and against the company, as framed under the company's constitution.  However, members cannot generally claim against third parties who cause damage to the company which results in a diminution in the value of their shares or others membership interests because this is treated as \"[[reflective loss]]\" and the law normally regards the company as the proper claimant in such cases.\n\nIn relation to the exercise of their rights, minority shareholders usually have to accept that, because of the limits of their voting rights, they cannot direct the overall control of the company and must accept the will of the majority (often expressed as ''majority rule'').  However, majority rule can be iniquitous, particularly where there is one controlling shareholder. Accordingly, a number of exceptions have developed in law in relation to the general principle of majority rule.\n\n* Where the majority shareholder(s) are exercising their votes to perpetrate a fraud on the minority, the courts may permit the minority to sue<ref>''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' (1843) 2 Hare 461</ref>\n* members always retain the right to sue if the majority acts to invade their personal rights, e.g. where the company's affairs are not conducted in accordance with the company's constitution (this position has been debated because the extent of a personal right is not set in law). ''Macdougall v Gardiner'' and ''Pender v Lushington'' present irreconcilable differences in this area.\n* in many jurisdictions it is possible for minority shareholders to take a ''representative'' or ''[[derivative action]]'' in the name of the company, where the company is controlled by the alleged wrongdoers\n\n==Corporate finance==\n{{main|Corporate finance}}\n{{see|Financial law}}\nThrough the operational life of the corporation, perhaps the most crucial aspect of corporate law relates to raising capital for the business to operate. The law, as it relates to corporate finance, not only provides the framework for which a business raises funds - but also provides a forum for principles and policies which drive the fundraising, to be taken seriously. Two primary methods of financing exists with regard to corporate financing, these are:\n*Equity financing; and\n*Debt financing \nEach has relative advantages and disadvantages, both at law and economically. Additional methods of raising capital necessary to finance its operations is that of retained profits<ref>Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 5-41</ref> Various combinations of [[Financial law|financing structures]] have the capacity to produce fine-tuned transactions which, using the advantages of each form of financing, support the limitations of the corporate form, its industry, or economic sector.<ref name=Gullifer>Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 38</ref>. A mix of both debt and equity is crucial to the sustained health of the company, and its overall market value is independent of its capital structure. One notable difference is that interest payments to debt is tax deductible whilst payment of dividends are not, this will incentivise a company to issue debt financing rather than [[preferred shares]] in order to reduce their tax exposure. \n===Shares and share capital===\n\n{{main|Stock}}\nA company limited by shares, whether public or private, must have at least one issued share; however, depending on the [[corporate structure]], the formatting may differ. If a company wishes to raise capital through equity, it will usually be done by issuing shares.  (sometimes called \"stock\" (not to be confused with stock-in-trade)) or [[warrant (finance)|warrants]]. In the common law, whilst a shareholder is often colloquially referred to as the owner of the company - it is clear that the shareholder is not an owner of the company but makes the shareholder a member of the company and entitles them to enforce the provisions of the company's constitution against the company and against other members.<ref name=Gullifer/><ref>Salomon v Salomon </ref> A share is an item of property, and can be sold or transferred. Shares also normally have a nominal or par value, which is the limit of the shareholder's liability to contribute to the debts of the company on an insolvent liquidation. Shares usually confer a number of rights on the holder.  These will normally include:\n* voting rights\n* rights to [[dividend]]s (or payments made by companies to their shareholders) declared by the company\n* rights to any return of [[capital (economics)|capital]] either upon redemption of the share, or upon the liquidation of the company\n* in some countries, shareholders have preemption rights, whereby they have a preferential right to participate in future share issues by the company\nCompanies may issue different types of shares, called \"classes\" of shares, offering different rights to the shareholders depending on the underlying regulatory rules pertaining to corporate structures, taxation, and capital market rules. A company might issue both ordinary shares and preference shares, with the two types having different voting and/or economic rights. It might provide that preference shareholders shall each receive a cumulative preferred dividend of a certain amount per annum, but the ordinary shareholders shall receive everything else. Corporations will structure capital raising in this way in order to appeal to different lenders in the market by providing different incentives for investment.<ref name=Gullifer/> The total value of issued shares in a company is said to represent its ''equity capital''.  Most jurisdictions regulate the minimum amount of capital which a company may have,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} although some jurisdictions prescribe minimum amounts of capital for companies engaging in certain types of business (e.g. [[banking]], [[insurance]] etc.).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\nSimilarly, most jurisdictions regulate the maintenance of equity capital, and prevent companies returning funds to shareholders by way of distribution when this might leave the company financially exposed. Often this extends to prohibiting a company from providing [[financial assistance (share purchase)|financial assistance]] for the purchase of its own shares.<ref>Janet Dine, Marios Koutsias ''Company Law''(Macmillan International Higher Education 2014), 77</ref>\n\n==Matters affecting the continuation of the Corporate form==\nEvents such as mergers, acquisitions, insolvency, or the commission of a crime will adversely affect the corporation in its current form. At the end of the corporate lifecycle, a corporation may be \"wound up\" and enter into bankruptcy liquidation. This often arises when the corporation is unable to discharge its debts in a timely manner. Comparatively, a merger or acquisition can often mean the altering or extinguishing of the corporation. In addition to the creation of the corporation, and its financing, these events serve as a transition phase into either dissolution, or some other material shift. \n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\n{{main|Mergers and acquisitions}}\n\n===Corporate insolvency===\n{{main|Insolvency law}}\nLiquidation is the normal means by which a company's existence is brought to an end. It is also referred to (either alternatively or concurrently) in some jurisdictions as ''winding up'' or ''dissolution''. Liquidations generally come in two forms \u2014 either ''compulsory liquidations'' (sometimes called ''creditors' liquidations'') and ''voluntary liquidations'' (sometimes called ''members' liquidations'', although a voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent will also be controlled by the creditors, and is properly referred to as a ''creditors' voluntary liquidation''). Where a company goes into liquidation, normally a [[Liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is appointed to gather in all the company's assets and settle all claims against the company. If there is any surplus after paying off all the creditors of the company, this surplus is then distributed to the members.\n\nAs its names imply, applications for compulsory liquidation are normally made by [[creditor]]s of the company when the company is unable to pay its debts.  However, in some jurisdictions, regulators have the power to apply for the liquidation of the company on the grounds of public good, i.e., where the company is believed to have engaged in unlawful conduct, or conduct which is otherwise harmful to the public at large.\n\nVoluntary liquidations occur when the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up the affairs of the company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become [[insolvent]], or it may be on economic grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.\n\nSome jurisdictions also permit companies to be wound up on \"just and equitable\" grounds.<ref>In England, see ''Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries'' [1973] AC 360</ref> Generally, applications for just and equitable winding-up are brought by a member of the company who alleges that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a prejudicial manner, and asking the court to bring an end to the company's existence.  For obvious reasons, in most countries, the courts have been reluctant to wind up a company solely on the basis of the disappointment of one member, regardless of how well-founded that member's complaints are.  Accordingly, most jurisdictions that permit just and equitable winding up also permit the court to impose other remedies, such as requiring the majority shareholder(s) to buy out the disappointed minority shareholder at a fair value.\n\n===Insider dealing===\n{{main|Insider dealing}}\n'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[corporation]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (e.g., [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with potential access to non-public information about the company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal if this trading is done in a way that does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on [[Materiality (law)|material]] non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a [[fiduciary]] or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm Insider Trading] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed May 7, 2008</ref> Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.<ref>[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf \"The World Price of Insider Trading\"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the Journal of Finance, Vol. LVII, No. 1 (Feb. 2002)</ref>\n\nIn the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders (in the United States, defined as beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the firm's equity securities) must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. Many investors follow the summaries of these insider trades in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable. While \"legal\" insider trading cannot be based on [[material non-public information]], some investors believe corporate insiders nonetheless may have better insights into the health of a corporation (broadly speaking) and that their trades otherwise convey important information (e.g., about the pending retirement of an important officer selling shares, greater commitment to the corporation by officers purchasing shares, etc.)\n\n== United States ==\n{{main|US corporate law}}{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], most corporations are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], or organized, under the laws of a particular [[U.S. state|state]]. The laws of the state of incorporation normally governs a corporation's internal operations, even if the corporation's operations take place outside that state. Corporate law differs from state to state.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Where To Incorporate Your Business|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/where_to_incorporate.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=20 July 2016}}</ref> Because of these differences, some businesses will benefit from having a corporate [[lawyer]] determine the most appropriate or advantageous state in which to incorporate.\n\nBusiness entities may also be regulated by [[federal law]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporations|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/corporations|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> and in some cases by [[local law]]s and ordinances.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salkin|first1=Patricia E.|title=Municipal Regulation of Formula Businesses|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|date=2008|volume=58|issue=4|page=1251|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/caselrev/vol58/iss4/17|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Delaware===\nA majority of publicly traded companies in the U.S. are [[Delaware corporation]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Division of Corporations|url=https://corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml|website=Delaware Division of Corporations|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Some companies choose to incorporate in Delaware because the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] offers lower corporate taxes than many other states.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/092515/4-reasons-why-delaware-considered-tax-shelter.asp|title=4 Reasons Why Delaware Is Considered a Tax Shelter|last=Tarver|first=Evan|date=2015-09-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[venture capitalists]] prefer to invest in Delaware corporations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feldman|first1=Sandra|title=Choice of Entity for Startups Seeking Venture Capital|url=https://ct.wolterskluwer.com/resource-center/articles/choice-entity-startups-seeking-venture-capital|website=Wolters Kluwer|publisher=CT Corporation System|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Also, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] is widely recognized as a good venue for the litigation of business disputes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quillen|first1=William T.|last2=Hanrahan|first2=Michael|title=A Short History of the Court of Chancery|url=https://courts.delaware.gov/chancery/history.aspx|website=Delaware Court of Chancery|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=1992}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{collist|\n*[[United Kingdom company law]] and the [[Companies Act 2006]]\n*[[United States corporate law]], the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] and the [[Model Business Corporation Act]]\n*[[German company law]], the [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/aktg/ Aktiengesetz (AktG)] and the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg/index.html Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung (GmbH-Gesetz, GmbHG)]\n*[[European company law]] and the ''[[Societas Europa]]''\n* [[State-owned enterprise]]\n* [[Enterprise Act 2002]]\n* [[Labour law]]\n* [[Competition law]]\n* [[Insolvency law]]\n* [[Consumer law]]\n* [[Public service law (disambiguation)|Public service law]]\n*[[List of company registers]]\n*[[List of company name etymologies]]\n*[[List of companies named after people]]\n*[[Types of companies]]\n*[[Quasi corporation]]\n*[[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n*[[Race to the bottom]]\n*[[Delaware Journal of Corporate Law]]\n* [[Business ethics]]\n* [[Corporate crime]]\n* [[Corporation sole]]\n* [[European Company Statute]]\n* [[Financial law]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Library resources box}}\n*{{Commons-inline}}\n*[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1103644 A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170930014512/http://www.heyman-center.org/  The Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate Governance [[Benjamin N.

The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of [[corporations]]. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation.<ref name=armour>John Armour, Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, Mariana Pargendler \"What is Corporate Law?\" in ''The Anatomy of Corporate Law: A Comparative and Functional Approach''(Eds Reinier Kraakman, John Armour, Paul Davies, Luca Enriques, Henry Hansmann, Gerard Hertig, Klaus Hopt, Hideki Kanda, Mariana Pargendler, Wolf-Georg Ringe, and Edward Rock, Oxford University Press 2017)1.1 </ref> It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.\n\nWhile the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by [[shareholders|share ownership]], [[capital market]], and [[business culture]] rules differ, similar legal characteristics - and legal problems - exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how [[corporations]], [[investor]]s, [[shareholders]], [[Board of directors|directors]], [[employees]], [[creditors]], and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] such as [[consumer]]s, the [[community]], and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] interact with one another.<ref name=armour/> Whilst the term '''company''' or '''business law''' is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, '''business law''' often refers to wider concepts of ''commercial law'', that is, the law relating to commercial or business related activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or [[financial law]]. When used as a substitute for corporate law, '''business law''' means the law relating to the ''business corporation'' (or business enterprises), i.e. capital raising (through equity or debt), company formation, registration, etc.\n\n== Overview ==\nAcademics identify four legal characteristics universal to business enterprises. These are: \n*[[Separate legal personality]] of the corporation (access to tort and [[Contract Law|contract law]] in a manner similar to a person)\n*[[Limited liability]] of the shareholders (a shareholder's personal liability is limited to the value of their shares in the corporation)\n*[[Share (finance)|Transferable share]]s (if the corporation is a \"[[public company]]\", the shares are traded on a [[stock exchange]])\n*[[Delegation|Delegated management]] under a board structure; the [[board of directors]] delegates day-to-day management of the company to [[Executive (management)|executives]].<ref name=armour/><ref>[[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2; H Hansmann et al, ''Anatomy of Corporate Law'' (2004) ch 1 set out similar criteria, and in addition state modern companies involve shareholder ownership. However this latter feature is not the case in many European jurisdictions, where employees participate in their companies.</ref>\nWidely available and user-friendly corporate law enables business participants to possess these four legal characteristics and thus transact as businesses. Thus, corporate law is a response to three endemic opportunism: conflicts between managers and shareholders, between controlling and non-controlling shareholders; and between shareholders and other contractual counterparts (including creditors and employees).\n\nA [[corporation]] may accurately be called a company; however, a company should not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. In the United States, a company may or may not be a separate legal entity, and is often used synonymous with \"firm\" or \"business.\" According to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], in America a company means \"a corporation \u2014 or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union \u2014 that carries on industrial enterprise.\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 8th edition (2004), {{ISBN|0-314-15199-0}}</ref> Other types of business associations can include [[partnership]]s (in the UK governed by the Partnership Act 1890), or [[trusts]] (Such as a pension fund), or companies limited by guarantee (like some community organizations or charities). Corporate law deals with companies that are incorporated or registered under the corporate or company law of a [[sovereign state]] or their [[Administrative division|sub-national states]]. \n\nThe defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the shareholders that own it. Under corporate law, corporations of all sizes have [[separate legal personality]], with [[limited liability|limited]] or [[unlimited company|unlimited]] liability for its shareholders. Shareholders control the company through a [[board of directors]] which, in turn, typically delegates control of the corporation's day-to-day operations to a full-time [[Executive (management)|executive]]. Shareholders' losses, in the event of liquidation, are limited to their stake in the corporation, and they are not liable for any remaining debts owed to the corporation's creditors. This rule is called [[limited liability]], and it is why the names of corporations end with \"[[Ltd.]]\". or some variant such as \"[[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]]\" or \"[[Public limited company|plc]]\"). \n\nUnder almost all legal systems{{which?|date=May 2018}} corporations have much the same legal rights and obligations as individuals. In some jurisdictions, this extends to allow corporations to exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,<ref>e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Art.8, especially Art.(4)</ref> and they may be responsible for human rights violations.<ref>Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) has a very good discussion of the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.</ref> Just as they are \"born\" into existence through its members obtaining a [[certificate of incorporation]], they can \"die\" when they lose money into [[insolvency]]. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offences, such as [[corporate fraud]] and [[corporate manslaughter]].<ref>e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]</ref>\n\n==Corporate Law Background==\nIn order to understand the role corporate law plays within commercial law, it is useful to understand the historical development of the corporation, and the development of modern company law.\n\n===History of the Corporation===\n{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Corporation#History|l1=History of corporations}}\n[[Image:South Sea Bubble.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Hogarth|Hogarthian]] image of the [[South Sea Bubble]], by [[Edward Matthew Ward]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nAlthough some forms of companies are thought to have existed during [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], the closest recognizable ancestors of the modern company did not appear until the 16th century. With increasing international trade, [[Royal charter]]s were granted in Europe (notably in [[England]] and [[Holland]]) to merchant adventurers.  The Royal charters usually conferred special privileges on the trading company (including, usually, some form of [[monopoly]]).  Originally, traders in these entities traded stock on their own account, but later the members came to operate on joint account and with joint stock, and the new [[Joint stock company]] was born.<ref>In England the first joint stock company was the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], which received its charter in 1600.  The [[Dutch East India Company]] received its charter in 1602, but is generally recognized as the first company in the world to issue joint stock. Not coincidentally, the two companies were competitors.</ref>\n\nEarly companies were purely economic ventures; it was only a belatedly established benefit of holding joint stock that the company's stock could not be seized for the debts of any individual member.<ref>In England, see ''Edmunds v Brown Tillard'' (1668) 1 Lev 237 and ''Salmon v The Hamborough Co'' (1671) 1 Ch Cas 204</ref> The development of company law in Europe was hampered by two notorious \"bubbles\" (the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] in England and the [[Tulip mania|Tulip Bulb Bubble]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]) in the 17th century, which set the development of companies in the two leading jurisdictions back by over a century in popular estimation.\n\n===Modern company law===\n[[File:Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|right|\"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock\", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]\nCompanies, almost inevitably, returned to the forefront of commerce, although in England to circumvent the [[Bubble Act]] 1720 investors had reverted to trading the stock of unincorporated associations, until it was repealed in 1825.{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}} However, the cumbersome process of obtaining Royal charters was simply insufficient to keep up with demand.  In England there was a lively trade in the charters of defunct companies.  However, procrastination amongst the legislature meant that in the United Kingdom it was not until the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]] that the first equivalent of modern companies, formed by registration, appeared. Soon after came the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], which in the event of a company's bankruptcy limited the liability of all shareholders to the amount of capital they had invested.\n\nThe beginning of modern company law came when the two pieces of legislation were codified under the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]] at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]]. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.\n\nIn a December 2006 article, ''[[The Economist]]'' identified the development of the joint stock company as one of the key reasons why Western commerce moved ahead of its rivals in the Middle East in post-[[renaissance]] era.<ref>\"Long ago, the region's failure to develop joint-stock companies was one reason why it fell behind the West.\" from [http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RQTPDDJ&login=Y&CFID=104408993&CFTOKEN=3fd5f61-d9f0ee11-3443-43d4-b694-1160bf9d5298 \"Think local\"]. ''The Economist''.</ref>{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Corporate Structure==\n{{Main article|Corporation}}\n{{see|Types of business entity}}\nThe law of business organizations originally derived from the [[common law]] of [[England]], and has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law countries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Corporation]]\n* [[Limited company]]\n* [[Unlimited company]]\n* [[Limited liability partnership]]\n* [[Limited partnership]]\n* [[Not-for-profit corporation]]\n* [[Company limited by guarantee]]\n* [[Partnership]]\n* [[Sole Proprietorship]]\nThe proprietary limited company is a statutory business form in several countries, including [[Australia]]. Many countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although there are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the [[limited liability company]] (LLC) and the [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP) in the United States. Other types of business organizations, such as [[cooperative]]s, [[credit unions]] and publicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the [[profit maximization]] mandate of business corporations.\n\nThere are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:\n* ''a [[company limited by guarantee]]''. Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[Liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company .\n* ''a company limited by guarantee with a share capital''. A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.\n* ''a [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]''. The most common form of company used for business ventures.\n* ''an [[Unlimited Company|unlimited company]]'' either with or without a share capital. This is a hybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but where the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal [[liquidation]].\nThere are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business organizations which may be formed in various countries and [[jurisdiction]]s throughout the world.\n\n===Corporate legal personality===\n{{main|Piercing the corporate veil}}\nOne of the key legal features of corporations are their separate legal personality, also known as \"personhood\" or being \"artificial persons\". However, the separate legal personality was not confirmed under [[English law]] until 1895 by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]''<ref>''[[Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' [1897] AC 22.</ref> Separate legal personality often has [[unintended consequence]]s, particularly in relation to smaller, [[family company|family companies]]. In ''[[B v. B]]'' [1978] Fam 181 it was held that a [[discovery (law)|discovery order]] obtained by a wife against her husband was not effective against the husband's company as it was not named in the order and was separate and distinct from him.<ref>Although it did attach to documents within the husband's custody or control.</ref> And in ''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]''<ref>''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]'' [1925] AC 619</ref> a claim under an insurance policy failed where the insured had transferred timber from his name into the name of a company wholly owned by him, and it was subsequently destroyed in a fire; as the property now belonged to the company and not to him, he no longer had an \"insurable interest\" in it and his claim failed.\n\nSeparate legal personality allows corporate groups flexibility in relation to tax planning, and management of overseas liability. For instance in ''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]''<ref>''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]'' [1990] Ch 433</ref> it was held that victims of asbestos poisoning at the hands of an American subsidiary could not sue the English parent in tort. Whilst academic discussion highlights certain specific situations where courts are generally prepared to \"[[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]]\", to look directly at, and impose liability directly on the individuals behind the company; the actually practice of piercing the corporate veil is, at English law, non-existent.<ref>Goode ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn, Sweet & Maxwell 2013)</ref>  However, the court will look beyond the corporate form where the corporation is a sham or perpetuating a fraud. The most commonly cited examples are:\n* where the company is a mere fa\u00e7ade\n* where the company is effectively just the agent of its members or controllers\n* where a representative of the company has taken some personal responsibility for a statement or action<ref>''Williams v Natural Life'' [1998] 1 WLR 830</ref>\n* where the company is engaged in fraud or other criminal wrongdoing\n* where the natural interpretation of a contract or statute is as a reference to the corporate group and not the individual company\n* where permitted by statute (for example, many jurisdictions provide for shareholder liability where a company breaches [[Environmental law|environmental protection laws]])\n\n====Capacity and powers====\n{{see also|Corporate benefit}}\nHistorically,  because companies are artificial persons created by operation of law, the law prescribed what the company could and could not do.  Usually this was an expression of the commercial purpose which the company was formed for, and came to be referred to as the company's ''objects'', and the extent of the objects are referred to as the company's [[capacity (law)|capacity]].  If an activity fell outside the company's capacity it was said to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' and [[void (law)|void]].\n\nBy way of distinction, the organs of the company were expressed to have various ''corporate powers''.  If the objects were the things that the company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them.  Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty.<ref>See the frustration expressed by the House of Lords in ''[[Cotman v. Brougham]]'' [1918] AC 514</ref> Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the things that a natural person could do, and power to do it in any way that a natural person could do it.\n\nHowever, references to corporate capacity and powers have not quite been consigned to the dustbin of legal history.  In many jurisdictions, directors can still be liable to their shareholders if they cause the company to engage in businesses outside its objects, even if the transactions are still valid as between the company and the third party.  And many jurisdictions also still permit transactions to be challenged for lack of \"[[corporate benefit]]\", where the relevant transaction has no prospect of being for the commercial benefit of the company or its shareholders.\n\nAs artificial persons, companies can only act through human agents. The main agent who deals with the company's management and business is the [[board of directors]], but in many jurisdictions other officers can be appointed too.  The board of directors is normally elected by the members, and the other officers are normally appointed by the board. These agents enter into contracts on behalf of the company with third parties.\n\nAlthough the company's agents owe duties to the company (and, indirectly, to the shareholders) to exercise those powers for a proper purpose, generally speaking third parties' rights are not impugned if it transpires that the officers were acting improperly.  Third parties are entitled to rely on the [[ostensible authority]] of agents held out by the company to act on its behalf.  A line of common law cases reaching back to ''[[Royal British Bank v Turquand]]'' established in common law that third parties were entitled to assume that the internal management of the company was being conducted properly, and the rule has now been codified into statute in most countries.\n\nAccordingly, companies will normally be liable for all the act and omissions of their officers and agents.  This will include almost all [[torts]], but the law relating to [[corporate manslaughter|crimes committed by companies]] is complex, and varies significantly between countries.\n\n====Corporate crime====\n{{main|Corporate liability|Corporate crime}}\n*[[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]\n\n===Corporate governance===\n{{main|Corporate governance}}\nCorporate governance is primarily the study of the power relations among a corporation's senior executives, its [[board of directors]] and those who elect them ([[shareholders]] in the \"[[general meeting]]\" and [[employees]]), as well as other stakeholders, such as [[creditors]], [[consumer]]s, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the [[community]] at large.<ref> Lin, Tom C. W., [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3294317 Incorporating Social Activism] (December 1, 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018) </ref> One of the main differences between different countries in the internal form of companies is between a two-tier and a one tier board. The United Kingdom, the United States, and most Commonwealth countries have single unified boards of directors. In Germany, companies have two tiers, so that shareholders (and employees) elect a \"supervisory board\", and then the supervisory board chooses the \"management board\". There is the option to use two tiers in France, and in the new European Companies ([[Societas Europaea]]).\n\nRecent literature, especially from the United States, has begun to discuss corporate governance in the terms of [[management science]]. While post-war discourse centred on how to achieve effective \"corporate democracy\" for shareholders or other stakeholders, many scholars have shifted to discussing the law in terms of [[principal\u2013agent problem]]s. On this view, the basic issue of corporate law is that when a \"principal\" party delegates his property (usually the shareholder's capital, but also the employee's labour) into the control of an \"agent\" (i.e. the director of the company) there is the possibility that the agent will act in his own interests, be \"opportunistic\", rather than fulfill the wishes of the principal. Reducing the risks of this opportunism, or the \"agency cost\", is said to be central to the goal of corporate law.\n\n\n====Constitution====\n{{main|Corporate constitution}}\n[[Image:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]], dating from 7 November 1623, for the amount of 2,400 [[Dutch gulden|florins]]]]\nThe rules for corporations derive from two sources. These are the country's statutes: in the US, usually the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] (DGCL); in the UK, the [[Companies Act 2006]] (CA 2006); in Germany, the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/aktg/ Aktiengesetz  (AktG)] and the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg/index.html Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung (GmbH-Gesetz, GmbHG).] The law will set out which rules are mandatory, and which rules can be derogated from. Examples of important rules which cannot be derogated from would usually include how to fire the [[board of directors]], what duties directors owe to the company or when a company must be dissolved as it approaches bankruptcy. Examples of rules that members of a company would be allowed to change and choose could include, what kind of procedure [[general meeting]]s should follow, when dividends get paid out, or how many members (beyond a minimum set out in the law) can amend the constitution.  Usually, the statute will set out [[Model Articles|model articles]], which the corporation's constitution will be assumed to have if it is silent on a bit of particular procedure.\n\nThe United States, and a few other common law countries, split the corporate constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The [[memorandum of Association]] (or [[articles of incorporation]]) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. \"this company makes automobiles\") and specifies the [[authorised share capital]] of the company. The [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] (or [[bylaw|by-laws]]) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails<ref>''[[Ashbury v. Watson]]'' (1885) 30 Ch D 376</ref> and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the [[charter]].\n\nIt is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as ''[[shareholders' agreement]]s'', whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way.  Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.<ref>''Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley'' [1924] NZLR 561</ref>  One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of ''[[voting trust]]s'', although these are relatively uncommon outside the [[United States]] and certain [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]]. Some jurisdictions consider the [[company seal]] to be a part of the \"constitution\" (in the loose sense of the word) of the company, but the requirement for a seal has been abrogated by legislation in most countries.\n\n====Balance of power====\n[[Image:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf Berle]] in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' argued that the separation of control of companies from the investors who were meant to own them endangered the American economy and led to a mal-[[distribution of wealth]].]]\nThe most important rules for corporate governance are those concerning the balance of power between the [[board of directors]] and the members of the company. Authority is given or \"delegated\" to the board to manage the company for the success of the investors. Certain specific decision rights are often reserved for shareholders, where their interests could be fundamentally affected. There are necessarily rules on when directors can be removed from office and replaced. To do that, meetings need to be called to vote on the issues. How easily the constitution can be amended and by whom necessarily affects the relations of power.\n\nIt is a principle of corporate law that the directors of a company have the right to manage. This is expressed in statute in the [[Delaware General Corporation Law|DGCL]], where \u00a7141(a)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml#TopOfPage|title=TITLE  8 - CHAPTER 1. GENERAL CORPORATION LAW - Subchapter IV. Directors and Officers|website=delcode.delaware.gov}}</ref> states,\n\n<blockquote>(a) The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.</blockquote>\n\nIn [[Germany]], \u00a776 [[Aktiengesellschaft|AktG]] says the same for the management board, while under \u00a7111 AktG the supervisory board's role is stated to be to \"oversee\" (''\u00fcberwachen''). In the [[United Kingdom]], the right to manage is not laid down in law, but is found in Part.2 of the [[Model Articles]]. This means it is a default rule, which companies can opt out of (s.20 [[Companies Act 2006|CA 2006]]) by reserving powers to members, although companies rarely do. UK law specifically reserves shareholders right and duty to approve \"substantial non cash asset transactions\" (s.190 CA 2006), which means those over 10% of company value, with a minimum of \u00a35,000 and a maximum of \u00a3100,000.<ref>See also, [[Listing Rule]] 10 for public companies, setting out a scale of transactions requiring shareholder approval and disclosure.</ref> Similar rules, though much less stringent, exist in \u00a7271 DGCL<ref>Shareholders must approve sale of \"all or substantially all assets\", held in ''Gimbel'' (1974) to be those \"qualitatively vital to the existence and purpose\" of the corporation; which in ''[[Katz v. Bregman]]'' (1981) was held to include assets under 50% of the company's value</ref> and through case law in Germany under the so-called ''[[Holzm\u00fcller-Doktrin]]''.<ref>The ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]'' held that shareholders must approve a sale of assets amounting to 80% of the company's value</ref>\n\nProbably the most fundamental guarantee that directors will act in the members' interests is that they can easily be sacked. During the [[Great Depression]], two [[Harvard University|Harvard]] scholars, [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]] wrote ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006<ref>c.f. ''[[Bushell v. Faith]]'', and query whether the decision would still be decided the same way.</ref> Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has been a year since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where employee participation creates the need for greater boardroom stability, \u00a784(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (''ein wichtiger Grund'') though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. \u00a7122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. \u00a7141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is \"classified\", meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director's autonomy from shareholders is seen further in \u00a7216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and \u00a7211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it.<ref>See also, SEC 13d-5, dating from times when groups of investors were considered potential [[cartel]]s, saying any 5% shareholder voting block must register with the Federal financial authority, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]].</ref> The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and \u00a7242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (\u00a7179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).<ref>Though the Constitution may allow particular provisions to be further \"entrenched\", s.22; Furthermore, Art.3 of the Model Articles allows 75% of members in general meeting to give the directors specific instructions.</ref>\n\n===Director duties===\n{{main|Board of directors|Directors' duties}}\nIn most jurisdictions, directors owe [[fiduciary|strict duties of good faith]], as well as duties of care and skill, to safeguard the interests of the company and the members. In many developed countries outside the English speaking world, company boards are appointed as representatives of both shareholders and employees to \"[[Codetermination|codetermine]]\" company strategy.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume2/issue2/MertensSchanze2J.Comp.Corp.L.&Sec.Reg.75(1979).pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Comparative Corporate Law and Securities Regulation|volume=2|date=1979|pages=75-88|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|title=The German Codetermination Act OF 1976|author1=Hans-Joachim Mertens|author2=Erich Schanze}}</ref> Corporate law is often divided into [[corporate governance]] (which concerns the various power relations within a corporation) and [[corporate finance]] (which concerns the rules on how capital is used).\nDirectors also owe strict duties not to permit any [[conflict of interest]] or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.  This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.  In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that, {{Quote frame|\"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal.  And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into...\"}} However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle.<ref>Goode ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn Sweet & Maxwell, 2013) 214</ref>  It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution. \nThe standard of skill and care that a director owes is usually described as acquiring and maintaining sufficient knowledge and understanding of the company's business to enable him to properly discharge his duties. This duty enables the company to seek compensation from its director if it can be proved that a director has not shown reasonable skill or care which in turn has caused the company to incur a loss.<ref>''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]'' [1983] Ch 258</ref> In many jurisdictions, where a company continues to trade despite foreseeable [[bankruptcy]], the directors can be forced to account for trading losses personally. Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose.  For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but in order to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.<ref>''[[Harlowe's Nominees Pty v. Woodside]]'' (1968) 121 CLR 483 (Aust HC)</ref>\n\n==Company law theory==\n\n[[Ronald Coase]] has pointed out, all business organizations represent an attempt to avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide [[limited liability]] to both members of the organization and external investors. Business organizations originated with [[Agency (law)|agency law]], which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behaviour.\n\n==Litigation==\n{{main|Derivative suit|Unfair prejudice}}\nMembers of a company generally have rights against each other and against the company, as framed under the company's constitution.  However, members cannot generally claim against third parties who cause damage to the company which results in a diminution in the value of their shares or others membership interests because this is treated as \"[[reflective loss]]\" and the law normally regards the company as the proper claimant in such cases.\n\nIn relation to the exercise of their rights, minority shareholders usually have to accept that, because of the limits of their voting rights, they cannot direct the overall control of the company and must accept the will of the majority (often expressed as ''majority rule'').  However, majority rule can be iniquitous, particularly where there is one controlling shareholder. Accordingly, a number of exceptions have developed in law in relation to the general principle of majority rule.\n\n* Where the majority shareholder(s) are exercising their votes to perpetrate a fraud on the minority, the courts may permit the minority to sue<ref>''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' (1843) 2 Hare 461</ref>\n* members always retain the right to sue if the majority acts to invade their personal rights, e.g. where the company's affairs are not conducted in accordance with the company's constitution (this position has been debated because the extent of a personal right is not set in law). ''Macdougall v Gardiner'' and ''Pender v Lushington'' present irreconcilable differences in this area.\n* in many jurisdictions it is possible for minority shareholders to take a ''representative'' or ''[[derivative action]]'' in the name of the company, where the company is controlled by the alleged wrongdoers\n\n==Corporate finance==\n{{main|Corporate finance}}\n{{see|Financial law}}\nThrough the operational life of the corporation, perhaps the most crucial aspect of corporate law relates to raising capital for the business to operate. The law, as it relates to corporate finance, not only provides the framework for which a business raises funds - but also provides a forum for principles and policies which drive the fundraising, to be taken seriously. Two primary methods of financing exists with regard to corporate financing, these are:\n*Equity financing; and\n*Debt financing \nEach has relative advantages and disadvantages, both at law and economically. Additional methods of raising capital necessary to finance its operations is that of retained profits<ref>Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 5-41</ref> Various combinations of [[Financial law|financing structures]] have the capacity to produce fine-tuned transactions which, using the advantages of each form of financing, support the limitations of the corporate form, its industry, or economic sector.<ref name=Gullifer>Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 38</ref>. A mix of both debt and equity is crucial to the sustained health of the company, and its overall market value is independent of its capital structure. One notable difference is that interest payments to debt is tax deductible whilst payment of dividends are not, this will incentivise a company to issue debt financing rather than [[preferred shares]] in order to reduce their tax exposure. \n===Shares and share capital===\n\n{{main|Stock}}\nA company limited by shares, whether public or private, must have at least one issued share; however, depending on the [[corporate structure]], the formatting may differ. If a company wishes to raise capital through equity, it will usually be done by issuing shares.  (sometimes called \"stock\" (not to be confused with stock-in-trade)) or [[warrant (finance)|warrants]]. In the common law, whilst a shareholder is often colloquially referred to as the owner of the company - it is clear that the shareholder is not an owner of the company but makes the shareholder a member of the company and entitles them to enforce the provisions of the company's constitution against the company and against other members.<ref name=Gullifer/><ref>Salomon v Salomon </ref> A share is an item of property, and can be sold or transferred. Shares also normally have a nominal or par value, which is the limit of the shareholder's liability to contribute to the debts of the company on an insolvent liquidation. Shares usually confer a number of rights on the holder.  These will normally include:\n* voting rights\n* rights to [[dividend]]s (or payments made by companies to their shareholders) declared by the company\n* rights to any return of [[capital (economics)|capital]] either upon redemption of the share, or upon the liquidation of the company\n* in some countries, shareholders have preemption rights, whereby they have a preferential right to participate in future share issues by the company\nCompanies may issue different types of shares, called \"classes\" of shares, offering different rights to the shareholders depending on the underlying regulatory rules pertaining to corporate structures, taxation, and capital market rules. A company might issue both ordinary shares and preference shares, with the two types having different voting and/or economic rights. It might provide that preference shareholders shall each receive a cumulative preferred dividend of a certain amount per annum, but the ordinary shareholders shall receive everything else. Corporations will structure capital raising in this way in order to appeal to different lenders in the market by providing different incentives for investment.<ref name=Gullifer/> The total value of issued shares in a company is said to represent its ''equity capital''.  Most jurisdictions regulate the minimum amount of capital which a company may have,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} although some jurisdictions prescribe minimum amounts of capital for companies engaging in certain types of business (e.g. [[banking]], [[insurance]] etc.).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\nSimilarly, most jurisdictions regulate the maintenance of equity capital, and prevent companies returning funds to shareholders by way of distribution when this might leave the company financially exposed. Often this extends to prohibiting a company from providing [[financial assistance (share purchase)|financial assistance]] for the purchase of its own shares.<ref>Janet Dine, Marios Koutsias ''Company Law''(Macmillan International Higher Education 2014), 77</ref>\n\n==Matters affecting the continuation of the Corporate form==\nEvents such as mergers, acquisitions, insolvency, or the commission of a crime will adversely affect the corporation in its current form. At the end of the corporate lifecycle, a corporation may be \"wound up\" and enter into bankruptcy liquidation. This often arises when the corporation is unable to discharge its debts in a timely manner. Comparatively, a merger or acquisition can often mean the altering or extinguishing of the corporation. In addition to the creation of the corporation, and its financing, these events serve as a transition phase into either dissolution, or some other material shift. \n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\n{{main|Mergers and acquisitions}}\n\n===Corporate insolvency===\n{{main|Insolvency law}}\nLiquidation is the normal means by which a company's existence is brought to an end. It is also referred to (either alternatively or concurrently) in some jurisdictions as ''winding up'' or ''dissolution''. Liquidations generally come in two forms \u2014 either ''compulsory liquidations'' (sometimes called ''creditors' liquidations'') and ''voluntary liquidations'' (sometimes called ''members' liquidations'', although a voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent will also be controlled by the creditors, and is properly referred to as a ''creditors' voluntary liquidation''). Where a company goes into liquidation, normally a [[Liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is appointed to gather in all the company's assets and settle all claims against the company. If there is any surplus after paying off all the creditors of the company, this surplus is then distributed to the members.\n\nAs its names imply, applications for compulsory liquidation are normally made by [[creditor]]s of the company when the company is unable to pay its debts.  However, in some jurisdictions, regulators have the power to apply for the liquidation of the company on the grounds of public good, i.e., where the company is believed to have engaged in unlawful conduct, or conduct which is otherwise harmful to the public at large.\n\nVoluntary liquidations occur when the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up the affairs of the company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become [[insolvent]], or it may be on economic grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.\n\nSome jurisdictions also permit companies to be wound up on \"just and equitable\" grounds.<ref>In England, see ''Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries'' [1973] AC 360</ref> Generally, applications for just and equitable winding-up are brought by a member of the company who alleges that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a prejudicial manner, and asking the court to bring an end to the company's existence.  For obvious reasons, in most countries, the courts have been reluctant to wind up a company solely on the basis of the disappointment of one member, regardless of how well-founded that member's complaints are.  Accordingly, most jurisdictions that permit just and equitable winding up also permit the court to impose other remedies, such as requiring the majority shareholder(s) to buy out the disappointed minority shareholder at a fair value.\n\n===Insider dealing===\n{{main|Insider dealing}}\n'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[corporation]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (e.g., [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with potential access to non-public information about the company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal if this trading is done in a way that does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on [[Materiality (law)|material]] non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a [[fiduciary]] or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm Insider Trading] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed May 7, 2008</ref> Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.<ref>[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf \"The World Price of Insider Trading\"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the Journal of Finance, Vol. LVII, No. 1 (Feb. 2002)</ref>\n\nIn the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders (in the United States, defined as beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the firm's equity securities) must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. Many investors follow the summaries of these insider trades in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable. While \"legal\" insider trading cannot be based on [[material non-public information]], some investors believe corporate insiders nonetheless may have better insights into the health of a corporation (broadly speaking) and that their trades otherwise convey important information (e.g., about the pending retirement of an important officer selling shares, greater commitment to the corporation by officers purchasing shares, etc.)\n\n== United States ==\n{{main|US corporate law}}{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], most corporations are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], or organized, under the laws of a particular [[U.S. state|state]].

This group was on its way to the gold fields in [[Coloma, California]], and it included Francois Gendron, Philibert Courteau, and Claude Chana. The young Chana discovered gold on May 16, 1848. After finding the gold deposits in the soil, the  trio decided to stay for more prospecting and mining.\n\n[[Placer deposit|Placer mining]] in the Auburn area was very good, with the camp first becoming known as the North Fork Dry Diggings. This name was changed to the Woods Dry Diggings, after John S. Wood settled down, built a cabin, and started to mine in the ravine.  The area soon developed into a mining camp, and it was officially named Auburn in August 1849. By 1850, the town's population had grown to about 1,500 people, and in 1851, Auburn was chosen as the seat of [[Placer County]]. Gold mining operations moved up the ravine to the site of present-day Auburn. In 1865, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the western leg of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], reached Auburn, as it was being built east from [[Sacramento]] toward [[Ogden, Utah]].\n\nThe restored Old Town has houses and retail buildings from the middle of the 19th century.

This group was on its way to the gold fields in [[Coloma, California]], and it included Francois Gendron, Philibert Courteau, and Claude Chana. The young Chana discovered gold on May 16, 1848. After finding the gold deposits in the soil, the  trio decided to stay for more prospecting and mining.\n\n[[Placer deposit|Placer mining]] in the Auburn area was very good, with the camp first becoming known as the North Fork Dry Diggings. This name was changed to the Woods Dry Diggings, after John S. Wood settled down, built a cabin, and started to mine in the ravine.  The area soon developed into a mining camp, and it was officially named Auburn in August 1849. By 1850, the town's population had grown to about 1,500 people, and in 1851, Auburn was chosen as the seat of [[Placer County]]. Gold mining operations moved up the ravine to the site of present-day Auburn. In 1865, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the western leg of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], reached Auburn, as it was being built east from [[Sacramento]] toward [[Ogden, Utah]].\n\nThe restored Old Town has houses and retail buildings from the middle of the 19th century.  The  oldest fire station and the Post Office date from the Gold Rush years. Casual gold-mining accessories, as well as American Indian and Chinese artifacts, can also be viewed by visitors at the Placer County Museum.\nAuburn was the home and birthplace of noted science fiction and fantasy poet and writer [[Clark Ashton Smith]]. A memorial to him is located near Old Town.\n\n==Landmarks==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Auburn statue.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue at the former Auburn Amtrak station honoring the 10,000+ Chinese workers (known then as \"Celestials\") who helped build the Central Pacific Railroad.]] -->\nAuburn is home to [[Placer High School]], which is one of the oldest high schools in California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://placer.puhsd.k12.ca.us/home/test/our-history|title=Our History - Placer High: Home of the Hillmen|website=placer.puhsd.k12.ca.us|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nLocal dentist Kenneth H.

Corrie and her sister Betsie opened their home to Jewish and Gentile refugees who were members of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]], and as a result they were sought after by the [[Gestapo]] and its Dutch counterpart. The secret room was in Corrie's bedroom behind a false wall and would hold 6 people. A ventilation system was installed for the occupants. A buzzer could be heard in the house to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible during security sweeps through the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corrie ten Boom Biography |url=https://www.biography.com/activist/corrie-ten-boom |website=Biography |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> They had plenty of room, but wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a family with a disabled daughter, whose father was a civil servant who was now in charge of the local ration-card office.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, \"I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'\" ten Boom wrote in ''The Hiding Place''. \"But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'\"<ref>Boom, Corrie ten.

Corrie received a letter one day in prison, \"All the watches in your cabinet are safe\", meaning that the refugees had managed to escape and were safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations.

After three months, she was taken to her first hearing.

The refuge housed concentration-camp survivors and exclusively sheltered jobless Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans during the Occupation until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946 and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbr\u00fcck, one of whom had been particularly cruel to Betsie.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this period.\n\nOne of these books is entitled \u201cTramp for the Lord\u201d and was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each chapter tells a short, different story about her world travels and sharing the Gospel message in Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and even in difficult to reach and dangerous countries such as Russia (then-[[USSR]]), Cuba, and China. It features photographs of Corrie and her important messages of forgiveness, hope, Love, and Salvation through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.\n\nCorrie told the story of her family members and their [[World War II]] work in her bestselling book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'' (1971), which was made into a 1975 [[World Wide Pictures]] film, ''[[The Hiding Place (film)|The Hiding Place]]'', starring [[Jeannette Clift]] as Corrie and [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Betsie. In 1977, the 85-year-old Corrie migrated to [[Placentia, California]]. In 1978, she suffered two [[stroke]]s, the first rendered her unable to speak, and the second resulted in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after suffering a third stroke.\n\nA sequel film, ''[[Return to the Hiding Place|Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)]]'', was released in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in 2013 it was released in the [[United States]].

watchmaker and later a writer who worked with her father, [[Casper ten Boom]], her sister [[Betsie ten Boom]] and other family members to help many [[Jews]] escape the [[Nazism|Nazis]] from [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] by hiding them in her home. They were caught, and she was arrested and sent to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]]. Her most famous book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'', is a biography that recounts the story of her family's efforts and how she found hope while she was imprisoned at the concentration camp.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:CorrieTenBoom.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Corrie ten Boom c. 1921]]\nCorrie ten Boom was born on 15 April 1892 to a working-class family in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, near [[Haarlem]]. Named after her mother, Cornelia, but known as Corrie all her life, she was the youngest child of [[Casper ten Boom]], a jeweler and watchmaker.<ref name=\"auto0\">{{Citation|  url = https://www.biography.com/people/corrie-ten-boom-21358155 | publisher = A&E Television Networks, LLC. | title =  Corrie ten Boom Biography}}</ref> Her father was fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and often became so engrossed in his work that he forgot to charge customers for his services.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=117}}</ref>\n\nShe trained to be a watchmaker herself, and in 1922, she became the first woman to be licensed as a watchmaker in The Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=23970|title=The Watchmaker's Secret Room: Corrie ten Boom, The Holocaust Rescuer Behind \"The Hiding Place\"|website=www.amightygirl.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref> Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father's shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction and classes in the performing arts, sewing, and handicrafts.<ref name=\"auto0\"/> She and her family were [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Christians]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and their faith inspired them to serve their society, which they did by offering shelter, food and money to those who were in need.<ref name=\"auto0\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Righteous Among the Nations}}\nIn May 1940, the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Germans invaded the Netherlands]]. One of their restrictions was the banning of the youth club.<ref>ten Boom, Corrie. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} In May 1942, a well-dressed woman came to the ten Booms' with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a [[Judaism|Jew]], her husband had been arrested several months earlier, her son had gone into hiding and Occupation authorities had recently visited her so she was afraid to go back. She heard that the ten Booms had previously helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they could help her too. Casper  readily agreed that she could stay with them although the police headquarters was only half a block away.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=118}}</ref> A devoted reader of the [[Old Testament]], he believed that the Jews were the \"[[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]]\" and told the woman, \"In this household, God's people are always welcome\".<ref>Boom, Corrie ten.

Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 88</ref> The family then became very active in the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] hiding refugees and honouring the Jewish [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A622388 | publisher = The British Broadcasting Company | title = DNA | contribution = H2G2}}.</ref> The family never sought to convert any of the Jews who stayed with them.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=119}}</ref>\n\nThus the ten Booms created \"The Hiding Place\" (Dutch: ''De Schuilplaats'' or ''de B\u00e9j\u00e9'', pronounced \"bayay\", an abbreviation of the street , [[Barteljorisstraat]]). Corrie and her sister Betsie opened their home to Jewish and Gentile refugees who were members of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]], and as a result they were sought after by the [[Gestapo]] and its Dutch counterpart. The secret room was in Corrie's bedroom behind a false wall and would hold 6 people. A ventilation system was installed for the occupants. A buzzer could be heard in the house to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible during security sweeps through the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corrie ten Boom Biography |url=https://www.biography.com/activist/corrie-ten-boom |website=Biography |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> They had plenty of room, but wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a family with a disabled daughter, whose father was a civil servant who was now in charge of the local ration-card office.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, \"I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'\" ten Boom wrote in ''The Hiding Place''. \"But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'\"<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 92</ref> He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.\n\nThe refugee work which ten Boom and her sister did at the Beje became known by the [[Dutch Resistance]], which sent an architect to the ten Boom home to build a secret room adjacent to the room for the Jews who were in hiding and an alert buzzer that could be used to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Arrest, detention and release===\nOn February 28th, 1944, a Dutch informant, Jan Vogel, told the Nazis about the ten Booms' work; at around 12:30 p.m. of that day, the Nazis arrested the entire ten Boom family. They were sent to [[Scheveningen]] Prison when Resistance materials and extra [[ration cards]] were found at the home.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=120}}</ref> Nollie and Willem were released immediately, along with Corrie's nephew Peter; Casper died ten days later. The group of six people hidden by the ten Booms, made up of both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered. Corrie received a letter one day in prison, \"All the watches in your cabinet are safe\", meaning that the refugees had managed to escape and were safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the [[Gestapo]] arrested some 30 people who were in the family home that day.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006914 | publisher = The Holocaust Memorial | title = Holocaust Memorial - Corrie ten Boom}}</ref>\n\nTen Boom was initially held in [[solitary confinement]]. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. At her trial, ten Boom spoke about her work with the mentally disabled; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed, because the Nazis had been [[Aktion T4|killing mentally disabled individuals]] for years in accordance with their [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] policies.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=121}}</ref> Ten Boom defended her work by saying that in the eyes of [[God]], a mentally disabled person might be more valuable \"than a watchmaker. Or a lieutenant.\"<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nCorrie and Betsie were sent from Scheveningen to [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]], a political [[concentration camp]] (also known as Kamp Vught) and finally to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]], a women's labor camp in [[Germany]]. There, they held worship services after the hard days at work by using a [[Bible]] that they had managed to smuggle in.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> While they were imprisoned at Ravensbruck, Betsie and her sister began to discuss plans for finding a place of healing after the war. Betsie's health continued to deteriorate, and she died on 16 December 1944 at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|pages=121\u2013122}}</ref> Before she died, she told Corrie, \"There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still.\" Fifteen days later, Corrie was released. Afterwards, she was told that her release was because of a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p 240</ref>\n\nCorrie returned home in the midst of the \"[[Dutch famine of 1944\u201345|hunger winter]]\". She still opened her doors to the mentally disabled who were in hiding for fear of execution.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=122}}</ref>\n\n==Life after the war==\nAfter the war, Corrie returned to the Netherlands to set up a [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] centre in [[Bloemendaal]]. The refuge housed concentration-camp survivors and exclusively sheltered jobless Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans during the Occupation until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946 and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbr\u00fcck, one of whom had been particularly cruel to Betsie.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this period.\n\nOne of these books is entitled \u201cTramp for the Lord\u201d and was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each chapter tells a short, different story about her world travels and sharing the Gospel message in Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and even in difficult to reach and dangerous countries such as Russia (then-[[USSR]]), Cuba, and China. It features photographs of Corrie and her important messages of forgiveness, hope, Love, and Salvation through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.\n\nCorrie told the story of her family members and their [[World War II]] work in her bestselling book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'' (1971), which was made into a 1975 [[World Wide Pictures]] film, ''[[The Hiding Place (film)|The Hiding Place]]'', starring [[Jeannette Clift]] as Corrie and [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Betsie. In 1977, the 85-year-old Corrie migrated to [[Placentia, California]]. In 1978, she suffered two [[stroke]]s, the first rendered her unable to speak, and the second resulted in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after suffering a third stroke.\n\nA sequel film, ''[[Return to the Hiding Place|Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)]]'', was released in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in 2013 it was released in the [[United States]].

{"title_page": "Easter Vigil", "text_new": "{{short description|Liturgy held in Christian churches}}\n[[File:Easter Vigil in Altoona, PA.PNG|thumb|An Easter Fire is featured in this [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], Roman Catholic Vigil service.]]\n'''Easter Vigil''', also called the '''Paschal Vigil''' or the '''Great Vigil of Easter''', is a [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] held in [[Christian worship#Sacramental tradition|traditional]] [[Christianity|Christian]] churches as the first official celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].  Historically, it is during this liturgy that people are [[baptism|baptized]] and that adult [[catechumen]]s are received into full communion with the Church. It is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on [[Holy Saturday]] and sunrise on [[Easter Day]] \u2013 most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight \u2013 and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset.\n\nAmong liturgical [[Western Christianity|western]] churches including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, the Easter Vigil is the most important [[Christian worship#Types of Christian worship|liturgy of public worship]] and [[mass (liturgy)|Masses]] of the [[liturgical year]], marked by the first use since the beginning of [[Lent]] of the exclamatory \"[[Alleluia]]\", a distinctive feature of the [[Eastertide|Easter season]].\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]],  and other traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]], the extremely festive [[Canonical hours|ceremonies]] and [[Divine Liturgy]] which are celebrated during the Easter Vigil are unique to that night and are the most elaborate and important of the [[liturgical year]].\n\n==Earliest known form of the Easter Vigil==\nThe original twelve Old Testament readings for the Easter Vigil survive in an ancient manuscript belonging to the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]].  The Armenian Easter Vigil also preserves what is believed to be the original length of the traditional gospel reading of the Easter Vigil, i.e., from the Last Supper account to the end of the Gospel according to Matthew.\n\nIn the earliest Jerusalem usage the vigil began with Psalm 117 [118] sung with the response, \"This is the day which the Lord has made.\"  Then followed twelve Old Testament readings, all but the last being followed by a prayer with kneeling.\n<blockquote>\n(1) Genesis 1:1--3:24 (the story of creation); (2) Genesis 22:1-18 (the binding of Isaac); (3) Exodus 12:1-24 (the Passover charter narrative); (4) Jonah 1:1--4:11 (the story of Jonah); (5)  Exodus 14:24--15:21 (crossing of the Red Sea); (6) Isaiah 60:1-13 (the promise to Jerusalem); (7) Job 38:2-28 (the Lord's answer to Job); (8) 2 Kings 2:1-22 (the assumption of Elijah); (9) [[Jeremiah 31:31-34]] (the [[New Covenant]]); (10) Joshua 1:1-9 (entry into the Promised Land); (11) Ezekiel 37:1-14 (the valley of dry bones); (12) Daniel 3:1-29 (the story of the three youths).\n</blockquote>The twelfth reading leads into the ''Song of the Three Children'' and is not followed by a prayer with kneeling, but is immediately followed by the [[prokeimenon]] of the Eucharistic liturgy.  Thomas Talley stresses the importance of this series of reading as representing the oldest known series and the one evidently having the very greatest influence on the development of all subsequent series of readings.<ref>Thomas J. Talley, ''The Origins of the Liturgical Year'', New York: Pueblo Publishing Company, Inc., 1986, pp.48-49.</ref>\n\nAccording to Byzantine historian Andrew Ekonomou, the Easter Vespers was unknown in Rome prior to its introduction in the mid-7th century, and solemnization by [[Pope Vitalian]] during the period when Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. The Paschal vespers was long celebrated in Constantinople prior to this and the liturgy itself has details that appear eastern in origin.<ref>Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington books, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Western churches==\n\n===Catholic Church===\n[[File:Bendici\u00f3n del fuego nuevo.JPG|thumb|Lighting of a paschal candle in [[Mexico City]].]]\n\nThe Roman Missal states: \"Of this night\u2019s Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be only one celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that after the Lucernarium and the \"Exsultet\", The Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this Vigil), Holy Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his people from the beginning, trusting in his word and promise (the second part, that is, the Liturgy of the Word) until, as day approaches, with new members reborn in Baptism (the third part), the Church is called to the table the Lord has prepared for his people, the memorial of his Death and Resurrection until he comes again (the fourth part).\"<ref>Roman Missal, The Easter Vigil in the Holy Night, 2</ref>\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy, the Easter Vigil consists of four parts:\n\n#The Service of Light\n#The [[Liturgy of the Word]]\n#Christian Initiation and the Renewal of Baptismal Vows\n#[[Eucharist]]\n\nThe vigil begins between sunset on [[Holy Saturday]] and sunrise on [[Easter Sunday]] outside the church, where an [[Easter fire]] is kindled and the [[Paschal candle]] is blessed and then lit. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life\".\n\nOnce the candle has been lit, it is carried by a deacon through the nave of the church, itself in complete darkness, stopping three times to chant the acclamation 'Light of Christ' ([[Lumen Christi]]), to which the assembly responds 'Thanks be to God' or 'Deo Gratias'. As the candle proceeds through the church, the small candles held by those present are gradually lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads, darkness is decreased.\n\nThe deacon, priest, or a cantor now chants the [[Exsultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\" or \"Paschal Praeconium\"), after which the people sit for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nOnce the paschal candle has been placed on its stand in the sanctuary, the lights in the church are switched on and the congregation extinguish their candles (although in some churches, the custom is to continue the liturgy by candlelight or without any lights until the Gloria).\n\nThe [[Liturgy of the Word]] consists of seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., 1.  Genesis 1:1-2:2; 2. Genesis 22:1-18; 3. Exodus 14:15-15:1; 4. Isaiah 54:4a.5-14; 5. Isaiah 55:1-11; 6. Baruch 3:9-15.32-4:4; 7. Ezekiel 36:16-17a, 18-28),<ref>Thomas Talley claims that the original readings of the Roman paschal vigil were Genesis 1, Genesis 22, Exodus 14, Deuteronomy 31, Isaiah 4, Isaiah 54 and Baruch 3.</ref> although it is permitted to reduce this number for pastoral reasons to at least three, or for ''very'' pressing pastoral reasons two. The account of the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea may never be omitted, since this event is at the centre of the Jewish [[Passover]], of which Christians believe Christ's death and resurrection is the fulfillment. Each reading is followed by a psalm or biblical canticle (i.e., Psalm 10, Exodus 15:1-18, Psalm 30, Isaiah 12:2-6, Psalm 19, Psalm 42 & 43) sung responsorially and by a prayer that relates what has been read in the Old Testament to the mystery of Christ. After these readings conclude, the altar candles are lit and the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung for the first time since before Lent (with the exception of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], as well as any solemnities or feasts that occurred during Lent), and the church bells and the organ, silent since that point on Holy Thursday, are sounded again - although it is customary in some churches to have no organ playing during Lent at all, except when accompanying hymns. (In the pre-Vatican II rite, the statues, which have been covered during [[Passiontide]], are unveiled at this time.)  The collect is sung or recited.  The reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] (Romans 6:3-11) is proclaimed, followed by the chanting of [[Psalm]] 118. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since before Lent and with special solemnity. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8 or Luke 24:1-12 follows, along with a [[homily]].\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is solemnly blessed, and any [[catechumen]]s and candidates for full communion are initiated into the church by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the [[asperges|sprinkling of]] [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The prayer of the faithful (of whom the newly baptised are now part) follow.\n\nAfter the prayers, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptized receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\nThe 20th century saw two major revisions of the Roman-Rite Easter Vigil liturgy. The first occurred in the 1950s under [[Pope Pius XII]]. Previously, the Vigil liturgy was held on Holy Saturday morning. Outside the church the Easter fire was lit and blessed, and five grains of incense were also blessed. All lamps and candles within the church were quenched, so as to be relit later with the new fire. (The rubrics did not envisage electricity or gas lighting.) At the church entrance, in the centre of the church, and then at the altar, each of the candles on a triple candlestick was in turn lit from a candle that had been lit from the new fire, and on each occasion this was followed by a genuflection and the chanting of \"Lumen Christi\". During the singing of the Exsultet, which then followed, the five grains of incense were placed in the paschal candle and the paschal candle was lit from one of the candles on the triple candlestick.\nThe Liturgy of the word consisted of twelve readings, for the most part without responsory chants: the seven mentioned above except the fourth and seventh, plus the account of the Flood (Gen 5-8) as the second; followed by a different one from Ezekiel (37:1-14), plus Isaiah 4:1-6, Exodus 12:1-11 (the introduction of the Paschal rites, also read then on Good Friday but now on Holy Thursday), Jonah 3:1-10, Deuteronomy 31:22-30, Daniel 3:1-24. The prayers after the readings were preceded by ''Flectamus genua'' and a genuflection, except for the last. After the Old Testament readings the baptismal font was blessed, and the conferral of baptism was envisaged, though rarely performed. The Litany of the Saints followed. Violet vestments were worn except for the deacon (or the priest performing the deacon's functions) who wore a white dalmatic in the procession and at the Exsultet. The priest, unless acting as deacon, wore a violet cope. After this, white Mass vestments were put on, and Mass followed. The Mass was in the then normal form (including the prayers at the foot of the altar), but without Introit, Agnus Dei, Postcommunion and Last Gospel. Its Epistle was Colossians 3:1-4, and the Gospel Matthew 28:1-7. Mass was followed immediately by abbreviated Vespers.\n\nPope Pius XII changed the hour of the celebration to after sunset. He separated the blessing and lighting of the Candle from the Exsultet to the beginning, the present position. The triple candlestick was no longer used. It was from the Paschal candle that, at the chanting of \"Lumen Christi\" (without genuflection) the priest would light his own candle at the Paschal candle; for the second, the rest of the clergy plus altar servers would, and for the third, the entire congregation. The Exsultet's function was turned (without change in the text) into a jubilant praise of the Paschal candle already blessed and lit. Of the Old Testament readings, only four were kept: what had been the first (story of Creation - now still the first), the fourth (Red Sea - now the third), the eighth (second from Isaiah) and the eleventh (Deuteronomy). Then followed the first part of the Litany of the Saints (only the names of the saints), the blessing of the font, possible baptisms, renewal of baptismal promises (a novelty with respect to the past and the first inclusion of the vernacular language in the general Roman liturgy), and the second part of the litany. After this came Mass (without prayers at the foot of the altar), followed by Easter lauds (no longer Holy Saturday Vespers). In virtue of the 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', this form may, under certain conditions, still be used because of its inclusion in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]] of [[Pope John XXIII]].\n\n===Anglicanism===\nAlthough the Easter Vigil is not universal in the [[Anglican Communion]], its use has become far more common in recent decades. Formerly it was only common in parishes in the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition, having been abandoned at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and recovered by the 19th-century [[Tractarian movement]].\n\nThe service, as provided for example in the current version of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (TEC), the [[Book of Alternative Services]] of the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] and the ''Times and Seasons'' volume of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Common Worship]], follows more or less the same form as the Roman Catholic liturgy described above, with some variations in texts and ritual.<ref>[http://www.churchofengland.org/media/41157/tseasterlit.pdf Times and Seasons: The Easter Liturgy]</ref> The four-part structure of the Vigil is retained, though in the TEC rite the service of [[baptism]] may follow immediately after the readings from the Old Testament.\n\nThe service normally consists of four parts:\n\n#The Service of Light.\n#The Service of Lessons.\n#Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows.\n#The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion.\n\nSome of the other particular differences from the Roman Catholic observance include:\n#If the service of baptism takes place after the Old Testament readings, the Gloria is sung after the Baptism or Renewal of Baptismal Vows. The Te Deum Laudamus or the Pascha Nostrum may be used in place of the Gloria.\n#The number and particular passages in the Service of Lessons differs. There are up to nine (as opposed to seven) readings from the Hebrew Bible.\n\n[[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmations]] occur only when the bishop is present, because, in the Anglican tradition, only a bishop may administer confirmation.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon with Easter candle]]\n[[File:Gemeinde osternacht.JPG|thumb|right|Congregation with small Easter candles]]\nThe Easter Vigil, like the Christmas Vigil, remained a popular festive worship service in the [[Lutheran]] churches during and after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It was often celebrated in the early morning hours of Easter Sunday. As in all Lutheran services of this period, vernacular language was used in combination with traditional liturgical texts in Latin (such as the [[Exsultet]]). Elements which were considered unbiblical and superstitious were eliminated, such as the blessing of the new fire, the consecration of the candles or of water. Emphasis was placed on the scriptural readings, congregational singing and on the Easter sermon. In [[Wittenberg]] the Easter [[Gospel]] (Matthew 28. 1 - 10; 16 - 20) was sung in the German language in a tone similar to the tone of the [[Exsultet]] - a gospel tone only used for this worship service. The devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]] also led to a decline in worship culture in the Lutheran Churches in Germany. The [[rationalism]] of the 18th century also brought about a change in worship habits and customs. The liturgical movement that arose in the German Lutheran Churches after World War I rediscovered the Easter Vigil in its reformational form. In an article from 1934 for the Liturgical Conference of [[Lower Saxony]] and for the [[Berneuchen Movement]] [[Wilhelm St\u00e4hlin]] appealed to fellow Lutherans for an Easter service on early Easter Sunday or on [[Holy Saturday]] night using elements from the [[Missal]], the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] tradition and from reformational service orders. An order for the Easter Vigil was published in 1936, and several Lutheran congregations in [[Hannover]] observed the Easter Vigil in 1937. Since then the Easter Vigil has experienced a revival in many parishes throughout Germany. This movement within the German Lutheran Churches contributed to a revival and revision of the [[Roman Catholic]] order for the Easter Vigil by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1951. The \"Agende II\" for the Evangelical Lutheran Churches and Parishes in Germany from 1960 gave the \"Osternacht\" (German for \"Easter Vigil\") a normative form. The most recent agenda for the Easter Vigil was published by the \"Vereinigte Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche\" in 2008.<ref>Mahrenholz, Christhard: Agende II f\u00fcr evangelisch-lutherische Kirchen und Gemeinden, Lutherisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1960, pp. 304 - 306; Schmidt-Lauber, Hans-Christoph: Die Zukunft des Gottesdienstes, Calwer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1990, pp. 395 - 396</ref> The order for the Easter Vigil is comparable to the order of service used by American Lutherans. It is characterized, however, by a number of [[Gregorian chants]], medieval and reformational [[hymns]] which have been in use in German worship services for centuries.\n\nIn North America the [[Lutherans]], similarly to the Anglicans, have in many places returned to the observance of the Easter Vigil [including the restoration of the blessing of the new fire].

It is during this liturgy that catechumens are baptized and that fact, together with the lengthy Old Testament readings, shows that this liturgy is analogous to the Easter vigil described in the previous sections,<ref>See the section on the original eschatological character of the Paschal Vigil in [[Quartodecimans]]</ref> seemingly representing development from a common tradition.\n\nIn the Byzantine tradition these Old Testament readings are:\n\n1. Genesis 1:1-13;\n2. Isaiah 60:1-16;\n3. Exodus 12:1-11;\n4. Jonah 1:1-4:11;\n5. Joshua 5:10-15;\n6. Exodus 13:20-15:19;\n7. Zephaniah 3:8-15;\n8. 3 Kings 17:8-24;\n9. Isaiah 61:10-62:5;\n10. Genesis 22:1-18;\n11. Isaiah 61:1-9;\n12. 4 Kings 4:8-37;\n13. Isaiah 63:11-64:5;\n14. Jeremiah 31:31-34;\n15. Daniel 3:1-68.\n\nIt is during these readings that catechumens may be baptized and chrismated, the order of which is given in the Book of Needs (''\u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd''; ''\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a'') and is performed while most of the faithful and clergy remain in the church for the readings, the newly baptised being led back into the church during the singing of \"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\" (sung in place of the [[Trisagion]]).<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a</ref>\n\nThis liturgy recounts the [[Harrowing of Hell]], at which time, according to Orthodox theology, the righteous dead were raised from [[Hades]] and entered into [[Paradise]]. This [[Gospel|Good News]] of Christ's triumph over death, the Church teaches, was at that time revealed only to the departed. The revelation to the living occurred when his tomb was found empty \"very early in the morning, on the first day of the week\" ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:2|KJV}}) and this vigil recounts that discovery of the empty tomb. Also commemorated is the Passover of the Law, which according to the Gospel of John, was on the Sabbath when Christ lay in the tomb, and among the Old Testament readings is the story of the Exodus out of Egypt, that reading ending with the antiphonal singing of the [[Song of the sea|Song of Moses]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|15:1-19}}).\n\nAlthough this vespers liturgy begins Sunday in the usual manner, including the resurrectional [[Sticheron|stichera]] of the first [[Echos|tone]], the feast of Pascha begins in the middle of the night, at the time Christ rose from the dead, while the text of and rubrics for Saturday's liturgy are found in the [[Triodion]], the Lenten liturgical book.\n\nBefore the Gospel reading, in place of the \"Alleluia\" sung at every other Liturgy of the year, is a [[prokeimenon]] during which, in the Russian tradition, all vestments and decorations of the church are quickly and dramatically changed from black to white.<ref>Sokolof, p 105</ref>  Another feature unique to this Liturgy is that the usual [[Cherubikon|Cherubic Hymn]] is replaced by that from the [[Liturgy of St. James]], \"[[Let all mortal flesh keep silence]]\".\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch receives the [[Holy Fire]] and subsequently celebrates the Divine Liturgy at the [[Holy Sepulchre]] (''i.e.'', empty tomb) of Christ on the very place where his body lay at the time of his Resurrection.\n\nAt the closing of this vespers/liturgy is a modified [[artoklasia]] at which bread, wine, and dates or figs are blessed and partaken of by the faithful as sustenance for the remainder of the fast.<ref name=\"\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 456\"/>  Thereafter is prescribed the reading of the Acts of the Apostles, which Saint [[John Chrysostom]] stated was the best proof of the Resurrection, and which is prescribed as the reading between vespers and matins at Sunday vigils for all of the fifty days of Pentecost.<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 472, for the subsequent Sundays, \"Are read from the Acts from the beginning or from the Commentaries of Chrysostom</ref>  In ancient times, the faithful would remain in the church throughout the night and thus the Paschal Vigil would have actually begun on the afternoon of Saturday and not ended until towards dawn on Sunday morning. In contemporary practice, however, there is typically a gap of some hours before this reading commences.\n\n===Saturday Midnight===\nThe order of the Paschal Vigil is as follows (with some minor local variations):\n\n#After the reading of the Acts of the Apostles the [[Midnight Office#Holy Saturday|Midnight Office]] is served \"at the fourth hour of the night\",<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 457</ref> generally, in practice, timed to end shortly before midnight,<ref>The Lenten Triodion, p 660</ref> during which is sung again the Canon of Holy Saturday and are read commentaries of Saints [[Epiphanius of Cyprus]] and [[John Chrysostom]].<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 457-458</ref>\n##The [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios (shroud)]] depicting the dead body of Christ is solemnly venerated for a last time and then ceremoniously taken into the altar and laid on the Holy Table towards the end of the canon.\n##After the dismissal of the midnight office all the lights in the church are extinguished except for the ''[[Sanctuary lamp|unsleeping flame]]'' on the [[Holy Table]] (altar), and all wait in silence and darkness. Where possible, the [[Holy Fire|Holy Light]] arrives from the [[Holy Sepulchre]] during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the unsleeping flame.\n#At the \"time for matins\",<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 458</ref> usually in practice at the stroke of midnight,<ref>Sokolof, p 106</ref> the priest [[censes]] around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the unsleeping flame. The [[Holy Doors]] are opened, after which the priest exclaims \"Come receive the light from the light that is never overtaken by night, and glorify Christ, Who is risen from the dead!\" or a similar variation depending on tradition. After this proclamation, the priest approaches the congregation with the [[Paschal trikirion]] (lit from the unsleeping flame), and the people light their candles from the flame.\n#Two vessels of incense, one in the altar, the other in the middle of the church, are lit.  The priest takes the blessing cross and the deacon a candle, and other priests take the Gospel Book and icon of the Resurrection, and process westward, opening the doors of the nave and the exterior doors and together with the people exit the church and go in [[Procession#Eastern Orthodox|procession]] three times around it while singing the hymn of the resurrection: \"Thy resurrection, O Christ our Saviour, the angels sing in the heavens, and us on earth make worthy to glorify Thee with pure hearts\" during which the [[church bell]]s ring incessantly. This procession recounts the journey of the [[Myrrhbearers]] to the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]]. During and after the procession, the priest carries a special triple candlestick, known as the [[Paschal trikirion]], and the deacon also carries a special [[Paschal candle]]. The candles lit at midnight are held by the people throughout the entire liturgy, just as is done by the newly baptized.\n#Before the front doors of the church, the priest gives the [[ekphonesis|blessing]] for the beginning of [[Matins]].  The clergy, followed by the people, sing the [[Paschal troparion]] with the Paschal Verses, and the [[Paschal greeting]] \"Christ is risen!\" \"Truly He is risen!\" is exchanged for the first time.  Then, everyone enters the church singing the troparion.\n#The rest of [[Matins]] is celebrated according to special Paschal [[rubric]]s. Everything in the liturgy is intended to be exultant and full of light. Nothing in the liturgy is read, but everything is sung joyfully. During the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], the priests cense the church, continually exchanging the Paschal greeting with the faithful. Towards the end of matins the [[Paschal Homily]] of [[St. John Chrysostom]] is proclaimed.\n#[[Egg as food|Eggs]] which have been dyed red are blessed and are usually distributed to the people for the breaking of the [[Great Lent]]en [[fasting|fast]].\n#The [[Paschal Hours]], which are of entirely different text than their usual order, are sung where it is the custom.\n#The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. [[John Chrysostom]] is celebrated as usual, but with special features added that are unique to the Paschal season.\n#At the end of the liturgy, the ''[[Artos]]'', a large loaf of leavened bread, which represents the Resurrected Christ, is blessed. This is then set next to the Icon of the Resurrection and is venerated by the faithful and carried in processions throughout [[Bright Week]].\n#Baskets of food for the feast that follows are blessed with [[holy water]].\n\nThe liturgy typically finishes at 3:00 or 4:00&nbsp;a.m. There is no prescribed liturgy on Sunday morning, everything for the feast having been celebrated during the Vigil. On Sunday afternoon there is a special, Paschal [[Vespers]], at which the [[Gospel]] ({{bibleverse||John|20:19-25}}) is chanted in many languages (called \"Vespers of Love\" in some traditions).\n\nThe week that begins on the Sunday of Pascha<ref>The Catholic scholar, [[Jean Danielou]] suggested in an article (\"Les quatre-temps de septembre et la fete des tabernacles,\" in ''La Maison Dieu'' 46 (1956)121, 124-127, that the Evangelist John composed his gospel so that the reading of his gospel in the Christian community for which wrote it would correspond with the Jewish legal calendar which began at Passover.  If this is true, then the Byzantine tradition of reading the opening chapters of John's Gospel at the Divine Liturgy on the Sunday of Pascha and during Bright Week would go back to the time of the very writing of the Gospel itself.</ref> is called [[Bright Week]], and is considered to be one continuous day.  The [[Holy Doors]] of the [[iconostasis]] are left open from the moment they were opened at midnight throughout all of Bright Week, being closed only at the end of the [[Ninth Hour]] on [[Bright Saturday]].  Most of the unique features of the Paschal liturgies continue through the week and following the Liturgy there is a festive [[Procession#Eastern Orthodox|procession]] around the outside of the church every day and the entire week is a fast-free period, even on Wednesday and Friday, which are normally [[fast day]]s throughout the year.\n\n==Oriental Orthodoxy==\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] consist of several different liturgical traditions.\n\n===Indian Orthodox Church===\nIn the [[Indian Orthodox Church]] the vigil begins in the evening after the liturgy on Good Friday. The faithful spend time in the church reading from the scriptures and singing hymns.\n\nThe church celebrates this most important festival in the church calendar, as per the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nTraditionally, the principal liturgy which corresponds to the Easter Vigil in Eastern and Western rites would be conducted in the early hours of the morning, typically at around 3 a.m. on Sunday. In many cities, however, the liturgy is conducted after 6:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday; this is also the case for practical reasons in former Christian lands of the Oriental Orthodox rite which now have Muslim majorities.\n\nEaster marks the change in the set of prayers said and sung before the Eucharist.  From Easter to the [[Feast of the Cross]] on September 14, the prayers follow the Liturgy of Easter.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEstrAnnouncement.JPG|thumb|220px|\"News Of Great Joy!\"]]Traditionally the Prayers of the Night and Midnight Hours are said. Then follows the most dramatic moment in the liturgy, the Announcement, when all the lights in the church are extinguished other than from the [[Altar candles]] and those held by those serving at the altar. The veil separating the sanctuary from the congregation is drawn aside. The chief celebrant stands in the centre of the sanctuary, holding a cross covered in a red embroidered cloth. This is the cross which has been used in the Good Friday liturgy for the procession commemorating the Carrying of the Cross to Calvary and then ritually embalmed and buried in a small coffin-shaped box behind the altar, to commemorate the Burial. The chief celebrant is flanked by the altar-servers, holding candles and hand-bells. In a loud voice, the chief celebrant announces to the congregation, \u201cDearly beloved, I bring you all news of great joy. Our Lord Jesus Christ has resurrected from the dead and defeated His enemies.\u201d Amid the ringing of the hand-bells and church-bells, the congregation responds, \"Truly, we believe that He is risen!\u201d This is done three times.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEstrPrcsn.jpg|frame|left|An Indian Orthodox Easter procession]]The Easter Procession follows, in which the entire congregation, holding lighted candles, participates with the celebrants and the altar servers. The cross, covered in the red veil, used in the Announcement, is carried in procession around the church. The hymn sung during the procession describes Christ's answer to Mary Magdalene, when she sees him at the tomb and mistakes him for the gardener:\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEasterCross.JPG|thumb|120px|An Easter Cross]]\n:O Mary! I am the Gardener truly,\n:I am the One, Who established Paradise.\n:I am the One Who was killed,\n:I am the One Who entered the grave.\n:Touch Me not, for I have not ascended to the Father.\n:That I have gloriously arisen from that grave,\n:Give thou this good news to the disciples.\n\nFollowing this, the chief celebrant \"celebrates\" the Cross, by blessing the four directions while the Trisagion is said.\n\nThe chief celebrant gives the Kiss of Peace, commemorating Christ's wishing peace on the Apostles.  This is passed on to the congregation.  On this day alone the Kiss of Peace is given twice.\n\nPrayers of the Morning hours follow, and the [[Holy Qurbana]] is then conducted as usual.\n\nSince Easter also marks the end of the Great 50-day Lent the Service of Reconciliation (Shubhkono) is also held on this day. Special prayers are said.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEasterBlessing.jpg|frame|left|Blessings from the Easter Cross]]At the end of the liturgy, instead of the normal touching by the Chief Celebrant's hand of the foreheads of each member of the congregation in blessing, the Easter Cross is used.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthGolgothaInSanctuary.jpg|frame|The Easter Cross on its stand in the sanctuary]]From Easter to the Feast of Ascension, the Easter Cross is moved from the centre of the church to a stand inside the sanctuary. This stand, called Golgotha, is itself shaped as a large cross.  The Easter Cross is set on its head, and the whole structure looks like a Patriarchal Cross. It had been set up in mid-Lent in the centre of the church and the faithful would kiss the cloth covering it while entering and leaving the church.\n\n==Citations==\n\n*{{Citation\n|year=1907\n|title=\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0456\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0432\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The [[Typicon]] which is the Order)\n|publisher=\u0421v\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442v\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444i\u044f (The Synodal Printing House)\n|publication-place=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n|pages=1154\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|year=1606\n|title=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The [Book of] Needs)\n|publisher=\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442v\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444i\u044f (The Patriarchal Printing Press)\n|publication-place=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|year=1978\n|publication-date=1987\n|title=The Lenten Triodion, translated from the Original Greek by Mother Mary and Archimandrite Kallistos Ware\n|publisher=[[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary|Saint Tikhon's Seminary Press]]\n|publication-place=[[South Canaan Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania|South Canaan, Pennsylvania]], USA\n|page=193\n|isbn=1-878997-51-3\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Sokolof\n|first=Archpriest Dimitrii\n|year=1899\n|publication-date=2001\n|title=Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n|pages=132\u2013136\n|place=[[Jordanville, New York]]\n|publisher=[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n|isbn=0-88465-067-7\n|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/sokolof/services.toc.html\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Ware\n|first=Timothy\n|year=1963\n|publication-date=1987\n|title=The Orthodox Church\n|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]\n|publication-place=[[London]], UK\n|page=193\n|isbn=978-0-14-013529-9\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.liturgies.net/Lent/EasterVigil.htm An Easter Vigil service (Episcopal)]\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Lutheran Church}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Easter liturgy]]\n[[Category:Mass in the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:Mass (liturgy)]]\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Christian liturgies]]\n[[Category:Lutheran liturgy and worship]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Liturgy held in Christian churches}}\n[[File:Easter Vigil in Altoona, PA.PNG|thumb|An Easter Fire is featured in this [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] Roman Catholic Vigil Service.]]\n'''Easter Vigil''', also called the '''Paschal Vigil''' or the '''Great Vigil of Easter''', is a [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] held in [[Christian worship#Sacramental tradition|traditional]] [[Christianity|Christian]] churches as the first official celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].  Historically, it is during this liturgy that people are [[baptism|baptized]] and that adult [[catechumen]]s are received into full communion with the Church. It is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on [[Holy Saturday]] and sunrise on [[Easter Day]] \u2013 most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight \u2013 and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset.\n\nAmong liturgical [[Western Christianity|western]] churches including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, the Easter Vigil is the most important [[Christian worship#Types of Christian worship|liturgy of public worship]] and [[mass (liturgy)|Masses]] of the [[liturgical year]], marked by the first use since the beginning of [[Lent]] of the exclamatory \"[[Alleluia]]\", a distinctive feature of the [[Eastertide|Easter season]].\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]],  and other traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]], the extremely festive [[Canonical hours|ceremonies]] and [[Divine Liturgy]] which are celebrated during the Easter Vigil are unique to that night and are the most elaborate and important of the [[liturgical year]].\n\n==Earliest known form of the Easter Vigil==\nThe original twelve Old Testament readings for the Easter Vigil survive in an ancient manuscript belonging to the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]].  The Armenian Easter Vigil also preserves what is believed to be the original length of the traditional gospel reading of the Easter Vigil, i.e., from the Last Supper account to the end of the Gospel according to Matthew.\n\nIn the earliest Jerusalem usage the vigil began with Psalm 117 [118] sung with the response, \"This is the day which the Lord has made.\"  Then followed twelve Old Testament readings, all but the last being followed by a prayer with kneeling.\n<blockquote>\n(1) Genesis 1:1--3:24 (the story of creation); (2) Genesis 22:1-18 (the binding of Isaac); (3) Exodus 12:1-24 (the Passover charter narrative); (4) Jonah 1:1--4:11 (the story of Jonah); (5)  Exodus 14:24--15:21 (crossing of the Red Sea); (6) Isaiah 60:1-13 (the promise to Jerusalem); (7) Job 38:2-28 (the Lord's answer to Job); (8) 2 Kings 2:1-22 (the assumption of Elijah); (9) [[Jeremiah 31:31-34]] (the [[New Covenant]]); (10) Joshua 1:1-9 (entry into the Promised Land); (11) Ezekiel 37:1-14 (the valley of dry bones); (12) Daniel 3:1-29 (the story of the three youths).\n</blockquote>The twelfth reading leads into the ''Song of the Three Children'' and is not followed by a prayer with kneeling, but is immediately followed by the [[prokeimenon]] of the Eucharistic liturgy.  Thomas Talley stresses the importance of this series of reading as representing the oldest known series and the one evidently having the very greatest influence on the development of all subsequent series of readings.<ref>Thomas J. Talley, ''The Origins of the Liturgical Year'', New York: Pueblo Publishing Company, Inc., 1986, pp.48-49.</ref>\n\nAccording to Byzantine historian Andrew Ekonomou, the Easter Vespers was unknown in Rome prior to its introduction in the mid-7th century, and solemnization by [[Pope Vitalian]] during the period when Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. The Paschal vespers was long celebrated in Constantinople prior to this and the liturgy itself has details that appear eastern in origin.<ref>Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington books, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Western churches==\n\n===Catholic Church===\n[[File:Bendici\u00f3n del fuego nuevo.JPG|thumb|Lighting of a paschal candle in [[Mexico City]].]]\n\nThe Roman Missal states: \"Of this night\u2019s Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be only one celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that after the Lucernarium and the \"Exsultet\", The Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this Vigil), Holy Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his people from the beginning, trusting in his word and promise (the second part, that is, the Liturgy of the Word) until, as day approaches, with new members reborn in Baptism (the third part), the Church is called to the table the Lord has prepared for his people, the memorial of his Death and Resurrection until he comes again (the fourth part).\"<ref>Roman Missal, The Easter Vigil in the Holy Night, 2</ref>\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy, the Easter Vigil consists of four parts:\n\n#The Service of Light\n#The [[Liturgy of the Word]]\n#Christian Initiation and the Renewal of Baptismal Vows\n#[[Eucharist]]\n\nThe vigil begins between sunset on [[Holy Saturday]] and sunrise on [[Easter Sunday]] outside the church, where an [[Easter fire]] is kindled and the [[Paschal candle]] is blessed and then lit. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life\".\n\nOnce the candle has been lit, it is carried by a deacon through the nave of the church, itself in complete darkness, stopping three times to chant the acclamation 'Light of Christ' ([[Lumen Christi]]), to which the assembly responds 'Thanks be to God' or 'Deo Gratias'. As the candle proceeds through the church, the small candles held by those present are gradually lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads, darkness is decreased.\n\nThe deacon, priest, or a cantor now chants the [[Exsultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\" or \"Paschal Praeconium\"), after which the people sit for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nOnce the paschal candle has been placed on its stand in the sanctuary, the lights in the church are switched on and the congregation extinguish their candles (although in some churches, the custom is to continue the liturgy by candlelight or without any lights until the Gloria).\n\nThe [[Liturgy of the Word]] consists of seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., 1.  Genesis 1:1-2:2; 2. Genesis 22:1-18; 3. Exodus 14:15-15:1; 4. Isaiah 54:4a.5-14; 5. Isaiah 55:1-11; 6. Baruch 3:9-15.32-4:4; 7. Ezekiel 36:16-17a, 18-28),<ref>Thomas Talley claims that the original readings of the Roman paschal vigil were Genesis 1, Genesis 22, Exodus 14, Deuteronomy 31, Isaiah 4, Isaiah 54 and Baruch 3.</ref> although it is permitted to reduce this number for pastoral reasons to at least three, or for ''very'' pressing pastoral reasons two. The account of the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea may never be omitted, since this event is at the centre of the Jewish [[Passover]], of which Christians believe Christ's death and resurrection is the fulfillment. Each reading is followed by a psalm or biblical canticle (i.e., Psalm 10, Exodus 15:1-18, Psalm 30, Isaiah 12:2-6, Psalm 19, Psalm 42 & 43) sung responsorially and by a prayer that relates what has been read in the Old Testament to the mystery of Christ. After these readings conclude, the altar candles are lit and the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung for the first time since before Lent (with the exception of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], as well as any solemnities or feasts that occurred during Lent), and the church bells and the organ, silent since that point on Holy Thursday, are sounded again - although it is customary in some churches to have no organ playing during Lent at all, except when accompanying hymns. (In the pre-Vatican II rite, the statues, which have been covered during [[Passiontide]], are unveiled at this time.)  The collect is sung or recited.  The reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] (Romans 6:3-11) is proclaimed, followed by the chanting of [[Psalm]] 118. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since before Lent and with special solemnity. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8 or Luke 24:1-12 follows, along with a [[homily]].\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is solemnly blessed, and any [[catechumen]]s and candidates for full communion are initiated into the church by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the [[asperges|sprinkling of]] [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The prayer of the faithful (of whom the newly baptised are now part) follow.\n\nAfter the prayers, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptized receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\nThe 20th century saw two major revisions of the Roman-Rite Easter Vigil liturgy. The first occurred in the 1950s under [[Pope Pius XII]]. Previously, the Vigil liturgy was held on Holy Saturday morning. Outside the church the Easter fire was lit and blessed, and five grains of incense were also blessed. All lamps and candles within the church were quenched, so as to be relit later with the new fire. (The rubrics did not envisage electricity or gas lighting.) At the church entrance, in the centre of the church, and then at the altar, each of the candles on a triple candlestick was in turn lit from a candle that had been lit from the new fire, and on each occasion this was followed by a genuflection and the chanting of \"Lumen Christi\". During the singing of the Exsultet, which then followed, the five grains of incense were placed in the paschal candle and the paschal candle was lit from one of the candles on the triple candlestick.\nThe Liturgy of the word consisted of twelve readings, for the most part without responsory chants: the seven mentioned above except the fourth and seventh, plus the account of the Flood (Gen 5-8) as the second; followed by a different one from Ezekiel (37:1-14), plus Isaiah 4:1-6, Exodus 12:1-11 (the introduction of the Paschal rites, also read then on Good Friday but now on Holy Thursday), Jonah 3:1-10, Deuteronomy 31:22-30, Daniel 3:1-24. The prayers after the readings were preceded by ''Flectamus genua'' and a genuflection, except for the last. After the Old Testament readings the baptismal font was blessed, and the conferral of baptism was envisaged, though rarely performed. The Litany of the Saints followed. Violet vestments were worn except for the deacon (or the priest performing the deacon's functions) who wore a white dalmatic in the procession and at the Exsultet. The priest, unless acting as deacon, wore a violet cope. After this, white Mass vestments were put on, and Mass followed. The Mass was in the then normal form (including the prayers at the foot of the altar), but without Introit, Agnus Dei, Postcommunion and Last Gospel. Its Epistle was Colossians 3:1-4, and the Gospel Matthew 28:1-7. Mass was followed immediately by abbreviated Vespers.\n\nPope Pius XII changed the hour of the celebration to after sunset. He separated the blessing and lighting of the Candle from the Exsultet to the beginning, the present position. The triple candlestick was no longer used. It was from the Paschal candle that, at the chanting of \"Lumen Christi\" (without genuflection) the priest would light his own candle at the Paschal candle; for the second, the rest of the clergy plus altar servers would, and for the third, the entire congregation. The Exsultet's function was turned (without change in the text) into a jubilant praise of the Paschal candle already blessed and lit. Of the Old Testament readings, only four were kept: what had been the first (story of Creation - now still the first), the fourth (Red Sea - now the third), the eighth (second from Isaiah) and the eleventh (Deuteronomy). Then followed the first part of the Litany of the Saints (only the names of the saints), the blessing of the font, possible baptisms, renewal of baptismal promises (a novelty with respect to the past and the first inclusion of the vernacular language in the general Roman liturgy), and the second part of the litany. After this came Mass (without prayers at the foot of the altar), followed by Easter lauds (no longer Holy Saturday Vespers). In virtue of the 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', this form may, under certain conditions, still be used because of its inclusion in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]] of [[Pope John XXIII]].\n\n===Anglicanism===\nAlthough the Easter Vigil is not universal in the [[Anglican Communion]], its use has become far more common in recent decades. Formerly it was only common in parishes in the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition, having been abandoned at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and recovered by the 19th-century [[Tractarian movement]].\n\nThe service, as provided for example in the current version of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (TEC), the [[Book of Alternative Services]] of the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] and the ''Times and Seasons'' volume of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Common Worship]], follows more or less the same form as the Roman Catholic liturgy described above, with some variations in texts and ritual.<ref>[http://www.churchofengland.org/media/41157/tseasterlit.pdf Times and Seasons: The Easter Liturgy]</ref> The four-part structure of the Vigil is retained, though in the TEC rite the service of [[baptism]] may follow immediately after the readings from the Old Testament.\n\nThe service normally consists of four parts:\n\n#The Service of Light.\n#The Service of Lessons.\n#Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows.\n#The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion.\n\nSome of the other particular differences from the Roman Catholic observance include:\n#If the service of baptism takes place after the Old Testament readings, the Gloria is sung after the Baptism or Renewal of Baptismal Vows. The Te Deum Laudamus or the Pascha Nostrum may be used in place of the Gloria.\n#The number and particular passages in the Service of Lessons differs. There are up to nine (as opposed to seven) readings from the Hebrew Bible.\n\n[[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmations]] occur only when the bishop is present, because, in the Anglican tradition, only a bishop may administer confirmation.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon with Easter candle]]\n[[File:Gemeinde osternacht.JPG|thumb|right|Congregation with small Easter candles]]\nThe Easter Vigil, like the Christmas Vigil, remained a popular festive worship service in the [[Lutheran]] churches during and after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It was often celebrated in the early morning hours of Easter Sunday. As in all Lutheran services of this period, vernacular language was used in combination with traditional liturgical texts in Latin (such as the [[Exsultet]]). Elements which were considered unbiblical and superstitious were eliminated, such as the blessing of the new fire, the consecration of the candles or of water. Emphasis was placed on the scriptural readings, congregational singing and on the Easter sermon. In [[Wittenberg]] the Easter [[Gospel]] (Matthew 28. 1 - 10; 16 - 20) was sung in the German language in a tone similar to the tone of the [[Exsultet]] - a gospel tone only used for this worship service. The devastation caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]] also led to a decline in worship culture in the Lutheran Churches in Germany. The [[rationalism]] of the 18th century also brought about a change in worship habits and customs. The liturgical movement that arose in the German Lutheran Churches after World War I rediscovered the Easter Vigil in its reformational form. In an article from 1934 for the Liturgical Conference of [[Lower Saxony]] and for the [[Berneuchen Movement]] [[Wilhelm St\u00e4hlin]] appealed to fellow Lutherans for an Easter service on early Easter Sunday or on [[Holy Saturday]] night using elements from the [[Missal]], the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] tradition and from reformational service orders. An order for the Easter Vigil was published in 1936, and several Lutheran congregations in [[Hannover]] observed the Easter Vigil in 1937. Since then the Easter Vigil has experienced a revival in many parishes throughout Germany. This movement within the German Lutheran Churches contributed to a revival and revision of the [[Roman Catholic]] order for the Easter Vigil by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1951. The \"Agende II\" for the Evangelical Lutheran Churches and Parishes in Germany from 1960 gave the \"Osternacht\" (German for \"Easter Vigil\") a normative form. The most recent agenda for the Easter Vigil was published by the \"Vereinigte Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche\" in 2008.<ref>Mahrenholz, Christhard: Agende II f\u00fcr evangelisch-lutherische Kirchen und Gemeinden, Lutherisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1960, pp. 304 - 306; Schmidt-Lauber, Hans-Christoph: Die Zukunft des Gottesdienstes, Calwer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1990, pp. 395 - 396</ref> The order for the Easter Vigil is comparable to the order of service used by American Lutherans. It is characterized, however, by a number of [[Gregorian chants]], medieval and reformational [[hymns]] which have been in use in German worship services for centuries.\n\nIn North America the [[Lutherans]], similarly to the Anglicans, have in many places returned to the observance of the Easter Vigil [including the restoration of the blessing of the new fire]. The recent service books of both the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] assume the service as normative.\n\nIn the [[Lutheran Service Book]], the Altar Book, the Vigil comprises the Service of Light with the [[Exsultet]]; the Service or Readings with up to 12 readings; the Service of Holy Baptism at which candidates may be baptized, the baptized confirmed, and the congregation remember its [[Baptism]] into [[Jesus]]; the Service of Prayer, featuring an Easter [[litany]]; and concluding with the Service of the Sacrament, at which the [[Holy Eucharist]] is celebrated.\n\n===Methodism===\nIn Methodism, the Easter Vigil is the first service of [[Eastertide]].<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\">{{cite book|title=The United Methodist Book of Worship|year=1992|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9780687035724|pages=[https://archive.org/details/churchofperfects0000unse/page/368 368\u2013376]|url=https://archive.org/details/churchofperfects0000unse/page/368}}</ref> The liturgy contained in [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]] divides the Easter Vigil into four parts:<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>\n\n#The Service of Light<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>\n#The Service of the Word<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>\n#The Service of the Baptismal Covenant<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>\n#The Service of the Table<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>\n\nThe Service of Light begins in silence outside of the church building in the nighttime and there, a new fire is kindled and each member of the congregation is given a candle; a greeting, opening prayer and lighting of the [[Paschal Candle]] from the new fire then solemnly occurs.<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/> The clergy and congregation receive the new light from the Paschal candle and then take part in a [[Procession#Christian processions|procession]] into the church, as a hymn is sung.<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/> The [[Exsultet|Easter Proclamation]] is then chanted by a [[deacon]] (if there is no deacon, a [[concelebration|concelebraing]] minister does the task and if there is no concelebrating minister, it is entrusted to a lay [[Cantor (Christianity)|cantor]]).<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/> The Service of the Word contains [[lection|readings]] explicating the following topics: \"The Creation\", \"The Covenant between God and the Earth\", \"Abraham's Trust in God\", \"Israel's Deliverance at the Red Sea\", \"Salvation Offered Freely to All\", \"A New Heart and a New Spirit\", \"New Life for God's People\", and \"Buried and Raised with Christ in Baptism\".<ref name=\"UMBOW1992\"/>  After each reading, a canticle is sung and then a prayer is offered.

It is during this liturgy that catechumens are baptized and that fact, together with the lengthy Old Testament readings, shows that this liturgy is analogous to the Easter vigil described in the previous sections,<ref>See the section on the original eschatological character of the Paschal Vigil in [[Quartodecimans]]</ref> seemingly representing development from a common tradition.\n\nIn the Byzantine tradition these Old Testament readings are:\n\n1. Genesis 1:1-13;\n2. Isaiah 60:1-16;\n3. Exodus 12:1-11;\n4. Jonah 1:1-4:11;\n5. Joshua 5:10-15;\n6. Exodus 13:20-15:19;\n7. Zephaniah 3:8-15;\n8. 3 Kings 17:8-24;\n9. Isaiah 61:10-62:5;\n10. Genesis 22:1-18;\n11. Isaiah 61:1-9;\n12. 4 Kings 4:8-37;\n13. Isaiah 63:11-64:5;\n14. Jeremiah 31:31-34;\n15. Daniel 3:1-68.\n\nIt is during these readings that catechumens may be baptized and chrismated, the order of which is given in the Book of Needs (''\u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd''; ''\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a'') and is performed while most of the faithful and clergy remain in the church for the readings, the newly baptised being led back into the church during the singing of \"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\" (sung in place of the [[Trisagion]]).<ref>\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a</ref>\n\nThis liturgy recounts the [[Harrowing of Hell]], at which time, according to Orthodox theology, the righteous dead were raised from [[Hades]] and entered into [[Paradise]]. This [[Gospel|Good News]] of Christ's triumph over death, the Church teaches, was at that time revealed only to the departed. The revelation to the living occurred when his tomb was found empty \"very early in the morning, on the first day of the week\" ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:2|KJV}}) and this vigil recounts that discovery of the empty tomb. Also commemorated is the Passover of the Law, which according to the Gospel of John, was on the Sabbath when Christ lay in the tomb, and among the Old Testament readings is the story of the Exodus out of Egypt, that reading ending with the antiphonal singing of the [[Song of the sea|Song of Moses]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|15:1-19}}).\n\nAlthough this vespers liturgy begins Sunday in the usual manner, including the resurrectional [[Sticheron|stichera]] of the first [[Echos|tone]], the feast of Pascha begins in the middle of the night, at the time Christ rose from the dead, while the text of and rubrics for Saturday's liturgy are found in the [[Triodion]], the Lenten liturgical book.\n\nBefore the Gospel reading, in place of the \"Alleluia\" sung at every other Liturgy of the year, is a [[prokeimenon]] during which, in the Russian tradition, all vestments and decorations of the church are quickly and dramatically changed from black to white.<ref>Sokolof, p 105</ref>  Another feature unique to this Liturgy is that the usual [[Cherubikon|Cherubic Hymn]] is replaced by that from the [[Liturgy of St. James]], \"[[Let all mortal flesh keep silence]]\".\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch receives the [[Holy Fire]] and subsequently celebrates the Divine Liturgy at the [[Holy Sepulchre]] (''i.e.'', empty tomb) of Christ on the very place where his body lay at the time of his Resurrection.\n\nAt the closing of this vespers/liturgy is a modified [[artoklasia]] at which bread, wine, and dates or figs are blessed and partaken of by the faithful as sustenance for the remainder of the fast.<ref name=\"\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 456\"/>  Thereafter is prescribed the reading of the Acts of the Apostles, which Saint [[John Chrysostom]] stated was the best proof of the Resurrection, and which is prescribed as the reading between vespers and matins at Sunday vigils for all of the fifty days of Pentecost.<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 472, for the subsequent Sundays, \"Are read from the Acts from the beginning or from the Commentaries of Chrysostom</ref>  In ancient times, the faithful would remain in the church throughout the night and thus the Paschal Vigil would have actually begun on the afternoon of Saturday and not ended until towards dawn on Sunday morning. In contemporary practice, however, there is typically a gap of some hours before this reading commences.\n\n===Saturday Midnight===\nThe order of the Paschal Vigil is as follows (with some minor local variations):\n\n#After the reading of the Acts of the Apostles the [[Midnight Office#Holy Saturday|Midnight Office]] is served \"at the fourth hour of the night\",<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 457</ref> generally, in practice, timed to end shortly before midnight,<ref>The Lenten Triodion, p 660</ref> during which is sung again the Canon of Holy Saturday and are read commentaries of Saints [[Epiphanius of Cyprus]] and [[John Chrysostom]].<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 457-458</ref>\n##The [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios (shroud)]] depicting the dead body of Christ is solemnly venerated for a last time and then ceremoniously taken into the altar and laid on the Holy Table towards the end of the canon.\n##After the dismissal of the midnight office all the lights in the church are extinguished except for the ''[[Sanctuary lamp|unsleeping flame]]'' on the [[Holy Table]] (altar), and all wait in silence and darkness. Where possible, the [[Holy Fire|Holy Light]] arrives from the [[Holy Sepulchre]] during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the unsleeping flame.\n#At the \"time for matins\",<ref>\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a, p 458</ref> usually in practice at the stroke of midnight,<ref>Sokolof, p 106</ref> the priest [[censes]] around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the unsleeping flame. The [[Holy Doors]] are opened, after which the priest exclaims \"Come receive the light from the light that is never overtaken by night, and glorify Christ, Who is risen from the dead!\" or a similar variation depending on tradition. After this proclamation, the priest approaches the congregation with the [[Paschal trikirion]] (lit from the unsleeping flame), and the people light their candles from the flame.\n#Two vessels of incense, one in the altar, the other in the middle of the church, are lit.  The priest takes the blessing cross and the deacon a candle, and other priests take the Gospel Book and icon of the Resurrection, and process westward, opening the doors of the nave and the exterior doors and together with the people exit the church and go in [[Procession#Eastern Orthodox|procession]] three times around it while singing the hymn of the resurrection: \"Thy resurrection, O Christ our Saviour, the angels sing in the heavens, and us on earth make worthy to glorify Thee with pure hearts\" during which the [[church bell]]s ring incessantly. This procession recounts the journey of the [[Myrrhbearers]] to the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]]. During and after the procession, the priest carries a special triple candlestick, known as the [[Paschal trikirion]], and the deacon also carries a special [[Paschal candle]]. The candles lit at midnight are held by the people throughout the entire liturgy, just as is done by the newly baptized.\n#Before the front doors of the church, the priest gives the [[ekphonesis|blessing]] for the beginning of [[Matins]].  The clergy, followed by the people, sing the [[Paschal troparion]] with the Paschal Verses, and the [[Paschal greeting]] \"Christ is risen!\" \"Truly He is risen!\" is exchanged for the first time.  Then, everyone enters the church singing the troparion.\n#The rest of [[Matins]] is celebrated according to special Paschal [[rubric]]s. Everything in the liturgy is intended to be exultant and full of light. Nothing in the liturgy is read, but everything is sung joyfully. During the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], the priests cense the church, continually exchanging the Paschal greeting with the faithful. Towards the end of matins the [[Paschal Homily]] of [[St. John Chrysostom]] is proclaimed.\n#[[Egg as food|Eggs]] which have been dyed red are blessed and are usually distributed to the people for the breaking of the [[Great Lent]]en [[fasting|fast]].\n#The [[Paschal Hours]], which are of entirely different text than their usual order, are sung where it is the custom.\n#The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. [[John Chrysostom]] is celebrated as usual, but with special features added that are unique to the Paschal season.\n#At the end of the liturgy, the ''[[Artos]]'', a large loaf of leavened bread, which represents the Resurrected Christ, is blessed. This is then set next to the Icon of the Resurrection and is venerated by the faithful and carried in processions throughout [[Bright Week]].\n#Baskets of food for the feast that follows are blessed with [[holy water]].\n\nThe liturgy typically finishes at 3:00 or 4:00&nbsp;a.m. There is no prescribed liturgy on Sunday morning, everything for the feast having been celebrated during the Vigil. On Sunday afternoon there is a special, Paschal [[Vespers]], at which the [[Gospel]] ({{bibleverse||John|20:19-25}}) is chanted in many languages (called \"Vespers of Love\" in some traditions).\n\nThe week that begins on the Sunday of Pascha<ref>The Catholic scholar, [[Jean Danielou]] suggested in an article (\"Les quatre-temps de septembre et la fete des tabernacles,\" in ''La Maison Dieu'' 46 (1956)121, 124-127, that the Evangelist John composed his gospel so that the reading of his gospel in the Christian community for which wrote it would correspond with the Jewish legal calendar which began at Passover.  If this is true, then the Byzantine tradition of reading the opening chapters of John's Gospel at the Divine Liturgy on the Sunday of Pascha and during Bright Week would go back to the time of the very writing of the Gospel itself.</ref> is called [[Bright Week]], and is considered to be one continuous day.  The [[Holy Doors]] of the [[iconostasis]] are left open from the moment they were opened at midnight throughout all of Bright Week, being closed only at the end of the [[Ninth Hour]] on [[Bright Saturday]].  Most of the unique features of the Paschal liturgies continue through the week and following the Liturgy there is a festive [[Procession#Eastern Orthodox|procession]] around the outside of the church every day and the entire week is a fast-free period, even on Wednesday and Friday, which are normally [[fast day]]s throughout the year.\n\n==Oriental Orthodoxy==\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] consist of several different liturgical traditions.\n\n===Indian Orthodox Church===\nIn the [[Indian Orthodox Church]] the vigil begins in the evening after the liturgy on Good Friday. The faithful spend time in the church reading from the scriptures and singing hymns.\n\nThe church celebrates this most important festival in the church calendar, as per the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nTraditionally, the principal liturgy which corresponds to the Easter Vigil in Eastern and Western rites would be conducted in the early hours of the morning, typically at around 3 a.m. on Sunday. In many cities, however, the liturgy is conducted after 6:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday; this is also the case for practical reasons in former Christian lands of the Oriental Orthodox rite which now have Muslim majorities.\n\nEaster marks the change in the set of prayers said and sung before the Eucharist.  From Easter to the [[Feast of the Cross]] on September 14, the prayers follow the Liturgy of Easter.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEstrAnnouncement.JPG|thumb|220px|\"News Of Great Joy!\"]]Traditionally the Prayers of the Night and Midnight Hours are said. Then follows the most dramatic moment in the liturgy, the Announcement, when all the lights in the church are extinguished other than from the [[Altar candles]] and those held by those serving at the altar. The veil separating the sanctuary from the congregation is drawn aside. The chief celebrant stands in the centre of the sanctuary, holding a cross covered in a red embroidered cloth. This is the cross which has been used in the Good Friday liturgy for the procession commemorating the Carrying of the Cross to Calvary and then ritually embalmed and buried in a small coffin-shaped box behind the altar, to commemorate the Burial. The chief celebrant is flanked by the altar-servers, holding candles and hand-bells. In a loud voice, the chief celebrant announces to the congregation, \u201cDearly beloved, I bring you all news of great joy. Our Lord Jesus Christ has resurrected from the dead and defeated His enemies.\u201d Amid the ringing of the hand-bells and church-bells, the congregation responds, \"Truly, we believe that He is risen!\u201d This is done three times.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEstrPrcsn.jpg|frame|left|An Indian Orthodox Easter procession]]The Easter Procession follows, in which the entire congregation, holding lighted candles, participates with the celebrants and the altar servers. The cross, covered in the red veil, used in the Announcement, is carried in procession around the church. The hymn sung during the procession describes Christ's answer to Mary Magdalene, when she sees him at the tomb and mistakes him for the gardener:\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEasterCross.JPG|thumb|120px|An Easter Cross]]\n:O Mary! I am the Gardener truly,\n:I am the One, Who established Paradise.\n:I am the One Who was killed,\n:I am the One Who entered the grave.\n:Touch Me not, for I have not ascended to the Father.\n:That I have gloriously arisen from that grave,\n:Give thou this good news to the disciples.\n\nFollowing this, the chief celebrant \"celebrates\" the Cross, by blessing the four directions while the Trisagion is said.\n\nThe chief celebrant gives the Kiss of Peace, commemorating Christ's wishing peace on the Apostles.  This is passed on to the congregation.  On this day alone the Kiss of Peace is given twice.\n\nPrayers of the Morning hours follow, and the [[Holy Qurbana]] is then conducted as usual.\n\nSince Easter also marks the end of the Great 50-day Lent the Service of Reconciliation (Shubhkono) is also held on this day. Special prayers are said.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthEasterBlessing.jpg|frame|left|Blessings from the Easter Cross]]At the end of the liturgy, instead of the normal touching by the Chief Celebrant's hand of the foreheads of each member of the congregation in blessing, the Easter Cross is used.\n\n[[Image:IndOrthGolgothaInSanctuary.jpg|frame|The Easter Cross on its stand in the sanctuary]]From Easter to the Feast of Ascension, the Easter Cross is moved from the centre of the church to a stand inside the sanctuary. This stand, called Golgotha, is itself shaped as a large cross.  The Easter Cross is set on its head, and the whole structure looks like a Patriarchal Cross. It had been set up in mid-Lent in the centre of the church and the faithful would kiss the cloth covering it while entering and leaving the church.\n\n==Citations==\n\n*{{Citation\n|year=1907\n|title=\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0456\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0432\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The [[Typicon]] which is the Order)\n|publisher=\u0421v\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442v\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444i\u044f (The Synodal Printing House)\n|publication-place=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n|pages=1154\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|year=1606\n|title=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The [Book of] Needs)\n|publisher=\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442v\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444i\u044f (The Patriarchal Printing Press)\n|publication-place=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|year=1978\n|publication-date=1987\n|title=The Lenten Triodion, translated from the Original Greek by Mother Mary and Archimandrite Kallistos Ware\n|publisher=[[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary|Saint Tikhon's Seminary Press]]\n|publication-place=[[South Canaan Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania|South Canaan, Pennsylvania]], USA\n|page=193\n|isbn=1-878997-51-3\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Sokolof\n|first=Archpriest Dimitrii\n|year=1899\n|publication-date=2001\n|title=Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n|pages=132\u2013136\n|place=[[Jordanville, New York]]\n|publisher=[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n|isbn=0-88465-067-7\n|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/sokolof/services.toc.html\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Ware\n|first=Timothy\n|year=1963\n|publication-date=1987\n|title=The Orthodox Church\n|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]\n|publication-place=[[London]], UK\n|page=193\n|isbn=978-0-14-013529-9\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.liturgies.net/Lent/EasterVigil.htm An Easter Vigil service (Episcopal)]\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Lutheran Church}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Easter liturgy]]\n[[Category:Mass in the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:Mass (liturgy)]]\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Christian liturgies]]\n[[Category:Lutheran liturgy and worship]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "Punctuation and capitalization", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Vigil"}

Jahangir Visiting the Ascetic Jadrup. ca. 1616-20, Musee Guimet, Paris.jpg|330px|thumb|[[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Emperor [[Jahangir]] visiting the ascetic Jadrup, c. 1616-20]]\n\n'''Mughal painting''' is a particular style of South Asian, particularly Indian, painting confined to [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums ([[muraqqa]]). It emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself partly of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]) and developed in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref>\n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted. Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint.\n[[File:Shahjahan on globe, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|''The Emperor Shah Jahan standing on a globe'', with a halo and European-style ''[[putti]]'', c.&nbsp;1618-19 to 1629.]]\n\nThe Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India. It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined. These are often described as \"post-Mughal\", \"sub-Mughal\" or \"provincial Mughal\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n==Subjects==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:25 Abu'l Hasan.

This had never been a feature of either [[Persian miniature]] or earlier Indian painting. The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 23-30</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref><ref>Abid.

Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 66</ref> There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 68</ref> Another new type of image showed the [[Jharokha Darshan]] (literally \"balcony view/worship\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb. In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits. Like the increasingly large [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] these emperors were given in single portraits, the [[iconography]] reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of [[Allah]] on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves.<ref>Hansen, Waldemar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA102 ''The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India'', 102, 1986, Motilal Banarsidass] {{ISBN|978-81-208-0225-4}}</ref><ref name=Kaur>{{Cite web|last= Kaur \n|first= Manpreet |url=http://www.ijifr.com/pdfsave/01-03-2015778V2-E6-064.pdf|format=pdf|title=\nRomancing The Jharokha: From Being A Source Of Ventilation And Light To The Divine Conception|date= February 2015|publisher=International Journal of Informative & Futuristic Research}}</ref> Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or [[Durbar (court)|in durbar]], or formal council. These and royal portraits incorporated in hunting scenes became highly popular types in later [[Rajput painting]] and other post-Mughal styles.\n\n===Animals and plants===\n[[File:\"Study of a Nilgai (Blue Bull)\", Folio from the Shah Jahan Album MET DT4808.jpg|thumb|[[Nilgai]] by [[Ustad Mansur]] (fl.&nbsp;1590-1624), who specialized in birds and animal studies for albums.]]\nAnother popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; the text of the ''[[Baburnama]]'' includes a number of descriptions of such subjects, which were illustrated in the copies made for Akbar. These subjects also had specialist artists, including [[Ustad Mansur]]. [[Milo C. Beach]] argues that \"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed. Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\". He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.<ref>Beach, 32-37, 37 quoted</ref>\n\n===Illustrated books===\nIn the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], was a ''[[Tutinama]]'' with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures. In contrast the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures. The work was \"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of [[Muhammad]].<ref>Beach, 61</ref> Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond. These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580.\n\nOther large projects included biographies or memoirs of the [[Mughal dynasty]]. [[Babur]], its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each. The ''[[Akbarnama]]'' was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with [[Jahangir]]'s autobiography ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama'') and a celebratory biography of [[Shah Jahan]], called the ''[[Padshahnama]]'', which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650. Akbar commissioned a copy of the ''[[Zafarnama (Yazdi biography)|Zafarnama]]'', a biography of his distant ancestor [[Timur]], but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father [[Humayun]], no illustrated manuscript survives.\n\nVolumes of the classics of [[Persian poetry]] usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions. Four are known of the ''[[Razmnama]]'', a ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617. Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the ''[[Ramayana]]''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0443\u0445 \u0411\u0435\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435. 1589. \u0413\u0430\u043b. \u0421\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|''Babur Receives a Courtier'' by [[Farrukh Beg]] c.&nbsp;1580-85.

Still using the style of [[Persian miniature]].]] \nMughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting. These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious. They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive.\n\nIn contrast Mughal painting was \"almost entirely secular\",<ref>Harle, 372</ref> although religious figures were sometimes portrayed. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], especially in portraits of both people and animals, became a key aim, far more than in Persian painting, let alone the Indian traditions.<ref>Harle, 372</ref> There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate of Delhi]] which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. These paintings were painted on loose-leaf paper, and were usually placed between decorated wooden covers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to [[Timur]] and were fully assimilated into [[Persianate]] culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.\n\nThe style of the Mughal school developed within the royal [[atelier]].

[[British Museum]]]]\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in [[Kabul]]), an unusually large painting on cloth of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]]. Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century [[Jahangir]] had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 50</ref> When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him. His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.<ref>Grove</ref> Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,<ref>Grove</ref> a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.<ref>Beach, 58</ref>\n\n===Akbar (r. 1556-1605)===\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.<ref>Beach, 49</ref>\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\".<ref>Grove</ref> \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 cotton [[Bookbinding|folio]]s, unusually large at 69&nbsp;cm x 54&nbsp;cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\". By the end, the style reached maturity, and \"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\".<ref>Losty, 15</ref>\n\n[[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570\u20131585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.<ref>Eastman</ref>\n\nAkbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire.\n<ref>Ebba Koch, Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Ebba |title=Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited |journal=Art Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n===Jahangir (1605\u20131625)===\n[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama''), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

The illustrations from the \"Padshanama\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view.\n\nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.<ref>Britannica</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state.\n\n==Later paintings==\n[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|A [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] scene with the newly crowned Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign.]]\n[[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings. After 1681 he moved to the [[Deccan]] to pursue his slow conquest of the [[Deccan Sultanates]], never returning to live in the north.<ref>Losty, 147, 149</ref>\n\nMughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary] by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]</ref> There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719\u201348), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759\u20131806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence. Late Mughal style often shows increased use of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and recession under Western influence.\n\n==Artists==\n[[File:Colophon portrait from the Khamsa of Nizami - BL Or.

Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded. Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.<ref>Losty, 31; Crill and Jariwala, 27; Britannica</ref>\n\nThis was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the ''[[Tutinama]]'', ''[[Baburnama]]'', ''[[Hamzanama]]'', ''[[Razmnama]]'', and ''[[Akbarnama]]''. For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work.<ref>Losty, 31</ref> An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}</ref>\n\nConveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature. Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters. For example, the [[Razmnamah (British Library, Or. 12076)|incomplete ''Razmnama'']] in the [[British Library]] contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.<ref>[https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/04/razmnamah-the-persian-mahabharata.html \"Razmnamah: the Persian Mahabharata\"], British Library ''Asian and African studies blog'', by Ursula Sims-Williams, April 2016 - see table near bottom</ref>\n\nOther important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:<ref>Diamind, Maurice.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].\n\n==Mughal style today==\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Painting of Akbar Mughal Period, National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|Portrait of Akbar\nFile:A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.jpg|A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.

It emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself partly of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]) and developed in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref>\n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted. Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint.\n[[File:Shahjahan on globe, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|''The Emperor Shah Jahan standing on a globe'', with a halo and European-style ''[[putti]]'', c.&nbsp;1618-19 to 1629.]]\n\nThe Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India. It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined. These are often described as \"post-Mughal\", \"sub-Mughal\" or \"provincial Mughal\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n==Subjects==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:25 Abu'l Hasan.

This had never been a feature of either [[Persian miniature]] or earlier Indian painting. The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 23-30</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref><ref>Abid.

Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 66</ref> There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 68</ref> Another new type of image showed the [[Jharokha Darshan]] (literally \"balcony view/worship\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb. In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits. Like the increasingly large [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] these emperors were given in single portraits, the [[iconography]] reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of [[Allah]] on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves.<ref>Hansen, Waldemar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AV--abKg9GEC&pg=PA102 ''The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India'', 102, 1986, Motilal Banarsidass] {{ISBN|978-81-208-0225-4}}</ref><ref name=Kaur>{{Cite web|last= Kaur \n|first= Manpreet |url=http://www.ijifr.com/pdfsave/01-03-2015778V2-E6-064.pdf|format=pdf|title=\nRomancing The Jharokha: From Being A Source Of Ventilation And Light To The Divine Conception|date= February 2015|publisher=International Journal of Informative & Futuristic Research}}</ref> Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or [[Durbar (court)|in durbar]], or formal council.

These subjects also had specialist artists, including [[Ustad Mansur]]. [[Milo C. Beach]] argues that \"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed. Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\". He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.<ref>Beach, 32-37, 37 quoted</ref>\n\n===Illustrated books===\nIn the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], was a ''[[Tutinama]]'' with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures. In contrast the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures. The work was \"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of [[Muhammad]].<ref>Beach, 61</ref> Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond. These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580.\n\nOther large projects included biographies or memoirs of the [[Mughal dynasty]]. [[Babur]], its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each. The ''[[Akbarnama]]'' was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with [[Jahangir]]'s autobiography ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama'') and a celebratory biography of [[Shah Jahan]], called the ''[[Padshahnama]]'', which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650. Akbar commissioned a copy of the ''[[Zafarnama (Yazdi biography)|Zafarnama]]'', a biography of his distant ancestor [[Timur]], but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father [[Humayun]], no illustrated manuscript survives.\n\nVolumes of the classics of [[Persian poetry]] usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions. Four are known of the ''[[Razmnama]]'', a ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617. Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the ''[[Ramayana]]''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0443\u0445 \u0411\u0435\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435. 1589. \u0413\u0430\u043b. \u0421\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|''Babur Receives a Courtier'' by [[Farrukh Beg]] c.&nbsp;1580-85.

Still using the style of [[Persian miniature]].]] \nMughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting. These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious. They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive.\n\nIn contrast Mughal painting was \"almost entirely secular\",<ref>Harle, 372</ref> although religious figures were sometimes portrayed. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], especially in portraits of both people and animals, became a key aim, far more than in Persian painting, let alone the Indian traditions.<ref>Harle, 372</ref> There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate of Delhi]] which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. These paintings were painted on loose-leaf paper, and were usually placed between decorated wooden covers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

[[British Museum]]]]\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in [[Kabul]]), an unusually large painting on cloth of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]]. Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century [[Jahangir]] had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors.<ref>Crill and Jariwala, 50</ref> When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him. His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.<ref>Grove</ref> Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,<ref>Grove</ref> a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.<ref>Beach, 58</ref>\n\n===Akbar (r. 1556-1605)===\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.<ref>Beach, 49</ref>\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\".<ref>Grove</ref> \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 cotton [[Bookbinding|folio]]s, unusually large at 69&nbsp;cm x 54&nbsp;cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\". By the end, the style reached maturity, and \"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\".<ref>Losty, 15</ref>\n\n[[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570\u20131585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.<ref>Eastman</ref>\n\nAkbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire.\n<ref>Ebba Koch, Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Ebba |title=Visual Strategies of Imperial Self-Representation:The Windsor P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma Revisited |journal=Art Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n===Jahangir (1605\u20131625)===\n[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'' (or ''Jahangirnama''), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyller|first=John|date=1999|title=Workshop and Patron in Mughal India: The Freer R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Other Illustrated Manuscripts of 'Abd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm|journal=Artibus Asiae.

The illustrations from the \"Padshanama\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view.\n\nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.<ref>Britannica</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state.\n\n==Later paintings==\n[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|A [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] scene with the newly crowned Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign.]]\n[[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings. After 1681 he moved to the [[Deccan]] to pursue his slow conquest of the [[Deccan Sultanates]], never returning to live in the north.<ref>Losty, 147, 149</ref>\n\nMughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary] by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]</ref> There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719\u201348), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759\u20131806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence. Late Mughal style often shows increased use of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and recession under Western influence.\n\n==Artists==\n[[File:Colophon portrait from the Khamsa of Nizami - BL Or.

Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded. Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.<ref>Losty, 31; Crill and Jariwala, 27; Britannica</ref>\n\nThis was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the ''[[Tutinama]]'', ''[[Baburnama]]'', ''[[Hamzanama]]'', ''[[Razmnama]]'', and ''[[Akbarnama]]''. For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work.<ref>Losty, 31</ref> An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}</ref>\n\nConveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature. Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters. For example, the [[Razmnamah (British Library, Or. 12076)|incomplete ''Razmnama'']] in the [[British Library]] contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.<ref>[https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/04/razmnamah-the-persian-mahabharata.html \"Razmnamah: the Persian Mahabharata\"], British Library ''Asian and African studies blog'', by Ursula Sims-Williams, April 2016 - see table near bottom</ref>\n\nOther important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:<ref>Diamind, Maurice.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].\n\n==Mughal style today==\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Painting of Akbar Mughal Period, National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|Portrait of Akbar\nFile:A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.jpg|A noble lady, Mughal dynasty, India. 17th century.
