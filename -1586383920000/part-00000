At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 61, based on seven reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]]'s Neil Yeung reviewed the album positively, stating that the production of the album was better than Horan's 2017 debut album, ''[[Flicker (album)|Flicker]]'', adding that \"despite the often dour and forlorn lyrical content, the songs are full-blooded and more energetic than the average breakup album\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Chris DeVille, writing for ''[[Stereogum]]'', stated that the album is \"much better\" than ''Flicker,'' commenting that ''Heartbreak Weather'''s writing, production, and performance all represented \"an upgrade\". However, he felt that \"Horan is capable of evolving\" but added that \"such flourishes suggest this boy-band alumnus may someday grow up to be the man after all \u2014 or at the very least he won't be desperate for a reunion tour\". Jason Scott, writing for ''[[American Songwriter]]'', named the record \"a stylistic leveling-up\" while complimenting Horan's take on heartbreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/niall-horan-heartbreak-weather-album-review/|title=Niall Horan Levels Up With Second Album, 'Heartbreak Weather'|website=[[American Songwriter]]|last=Scott|first=Jason|date=13 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Michael Cragg of ''[[The Guardian]]'' highlighted that the album contains \"hints of experimentation, such as the swaggering hybrid of [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[Kasabian]] in \"Nice To Meet Ya\", but it's the excellent title track's flirtation with glossy, [[Synthesizer|synth]]-tinged MOR that suggests where Horan might be headed next. Proof that it's often the quiet ones you need to keep an eye on\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Mike Wass, writing for [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]], wrote that the record \"just might be pop\u2019s first, feel-good breakup album\" and that \"there's no sophomore slump here\" while calling it \"a winning collection of love songs from multiple perspectives with very few skips.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idolator.com/7908098/album-review-niall-horan-lightens-up-on-breezy-heartbreak-weather?safari=1|title=Album Review: Niall Horan Lightens Up On Breezy \u2018Heartbreak Weather\u2019|website=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|last=Wass|first=Mike|date=15 March 2020|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Mark Kennedy of the [[Associated Press]] called the album an \"overall bright collection\" and felt that Horan made \"14 perfectly fine tracks, if not volcanic ones\" and that it \"is in no way a disaster\" but that \"it's just not an improvement on his debut effort\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/00539b12b29a24f73718aec32e89984c|title=Music Review: Niall Horan endures a stormy 2nd solo album|website=[[Associated Press]]|last=Kennedy|first=Mark|date=10 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Ella Kemp of ''[[NME]]'' called the album \"a mixed bag\" and felt that there was \"a great voice let down by some not great songs\", writing that Horan's \"lyrical landscape is somewhat thinner and the production even more impenetrable\" than that of ''Flicker''. She concluded by complimenting Horan's \"incredible\" and \"convincing\" voice, adding that the album \"isn't an entirely lost cause, but one to build upon for a more inspiring future all the same\".<ref name=\"NME\"/> Adam White, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', described ''Heartbreak Weather'' as \"a tranquilliser of an album that only occasionally sparks to life\" and \"largely drab\", explaining that Horan \"struggles to define his musical identity on his shiny if haphazard second album\" which is \"entirely stuck on safe mode\". Nevertheless, White specifically praised \"New Angel\" and \"Arms of a Stranger\", calling the latter \"concert-ready and irresistibly shiny\".<ref name=\"ind\"/> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Neil McCormick felt like the album lacks \"any particular character\" and that \"everything sounds like something you might have heard somewhere before\", stating that the record is \"the closest thing to a [[One Direction]] album since the band split\".<ref name=\"TDT\"/> Ed Power of the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' wrote that Horan \"ticks the boxes but doesn't cause a

''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', felt the Horan \"spends too much of the record bouncing between sounds and songwriting concepts to feel distinct\" but did compliment the album's final track,

However, he felt that \"Horan is capable of evolving\" but added that \"such flourishes suggest this boy-band alumnus may someday grow up to be the man after all \u2014 or at the very least he won't be desperate for a reunion tour\". Jason Scott, writing for ''[[American Songwriter]]'', named the record \"a stylistic leveling-up\" while complimenting Horan's take on heartbreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/niall-horan-heartbreak-weather-album-review/|title=Niall Horan Levels Up With Second Album, 'Heartbreak Weather'|website=[[American Songwriter]]|last=Scott|first=Jason|date=13 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Michael Cragg of ''[[The Guardian]]'' highlighted that the album contains \"hints of experimentation, such as the swaggering hybrid of [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[Kasabian]] in \"Nice To Meet Ya\", but it's the excellent title track's flirtation with glossy, [[Synthesizer|synth]]-tinged MOR that suggests where Horan might be headed next. Proof that it's often the quiet ones you need to keep an eye on\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Mike Wass, writing for [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]], wrote that the record \"just might be pop\u2019s first, feel-good breakup album\" and that \"there's no sophomore slump here\" while calling it \"a winning collection of love songs from multiple perspectives with very few skips.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idolator.com/7908098/album-review-niall-horan-lightens-up-on-breezy-heartbreak-weather?safari=1|title=Album Review: Niall Horan Lightens Up On Breezy \u2018Heartbreak Weather\u2019|website=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|last=Wass|first=Mike|date=15 March 2020|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Mark Kennedy of the [[Associated Press]] called the album an \"overall bright collection\" and felt that Horan made \"14 perfectly fine tracks, if not volcanic ones\" and that it \"is in no way a disaster\" but that \"it's just not an improvement on his debut effort\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/00539b12b29a24f73718aec32e89984c|title=Music Review: Niall Horan endures a stormy 2nd solo album|website=[[Associated Press]]|last=Kennedy|first=Mark|date=10 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Ella Kemp of ''[[NME]]'' called the album \"a mixed bag\" and felt that there was \"a great voice let down by some not great songs\", writing that Horan's \"lyrical landscape is somewhat thinner and the production even more impenetrable\" than that of ''Flicker''. She concluded by complimenting Horan's \"incredible\" and \"convincing\" voice, adding that the album \"isn't an entirely lost cause, but one to build upon for a more inspiring future all the same\".<ref name=\"NME\"/> Adam White, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', described ''Heartbreak Weather'' as \"a tranquilliser of an album that only occasionally sparks to life\" and \"largely drab\", explaining that Horan \"struggles to define his musical identity on his shiny if haphazard second album\" which is \"entirely stuck on safe mode\". Nevertheless, White specifically praised \"New Angel\" and \"Arms of a Stranger\", calling the latter \"concert-ready and irresistibly shiny\".<ref name=\"ind\"/> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Neil McCormick felt like the album lacks \"any particular character\" and that \"everything sounds like something you might have heard somewhere before\", stating that the record is \"the closest thing to a [[One Direction]] album since the band split\".<ref name=\"TDT\"/> Ed Power of the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' wrote that Horan \"ticks the boxes but doesn't cause a

''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', felt the Horan \"spends too much of the record bouncing between sounds and songwriting concepts to feel distinct\" but did compliment the album's final track, \"Still,\" calling it \"the realest, rawest moment on the record and a small bit of proof that Horan has the potential to make it on his own.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\n==Commercial

While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of [[Jesus]]. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked.

Valentinus replied that all of the [[Idolatry|idols]] around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo the Christian sacrament of [[baptism]]. The judge obeyed and, as a result of his fasting and prayer, freed all the [[Christians|Christian]] inmates under his authority.

The very brief ''vita'' of St Valentine states that he was executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the \"Emperor Claudius\"<ref>Under the circumstances, Emperor Claudius was a detail meant to enhance verisimilitude. Attempts to identify him with the only 3rd-century Claudius, [[Claudius Gothicus]], who spent his brief reign (268\u2013270) away from Rome winning his [[cognomen]], are illusions in pursuit of a literary phantom: \"No evidence outside several late saints' legends suggests that Claudius II reversed the policy of toleration established by the policy of his predecessor [[Gallienus]]\", Jack Oruch states, in \"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February\", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981), p. 536, referencing [[William H. C. Frend]], ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church'' (New York, 1967, p. 326.</ref> in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of \"Valentine\", \"as containing valor\".\n\nA popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus]].<!--is the following in the Nuremberg Chronicle?--> He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]]. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.<ref>Jack Oruch, \"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February\", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp. 534\u2013565 [535]).</ref>\n\nThere are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly performed [[Christian views on marriage|Christian weddings]] for couples, allowing the husbands involved to escape conscription into the pagan army.

While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of [[Jesus]].

Valentinus replied that all of the [[Idolatry|idols]] around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo the Christian sacrament of [[baptism]]. The judge obeyed and, as a result of his fasting and prayer, freed all the [[Christians|Christian]] inmates under his authority.

The very brief ''vita'' of St Valentine states that he was executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the \"Emperor Claudius\"<ref>Under the circumstances, Emperor Claudius was a detail meant to enhance verisimilitude. Attempts to identify him with the only 3rd-century Claudius, [[Claudius Gothicus]], who spent his brief reign (268\u2013270) away from Rome winning his [[cognomen]], are illusions in pursuit of a literary phantom: \"No evidence outside several late saints' legends suggests that Claudius II reversed the policy of toleration established by the policy of his predecessor [[Gallienus]]\", Jack Oruch states, in \"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February\", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981), p. 536, referencing [[William H.

Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of \"Valentine\", \"as containing valor\".\n\nA popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus]].<!--is the following in the Nuremberg Chronicle?--> He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]]. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.<ref>Jack Oruch, \"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February\", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp. 534\u2013565 [535]).</ref>\n\nThere are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly performed [[Christian views on marriage|Christian weddings]] for couples, allowing the husbands involved to escape conscription into the pagan army.

A self-described [[Metagrobology|metagrobologist]], he has a huge personal collection of [[mechanical puzzle]]s and books of [[brain teaser]]s. He is most famous for being an early adopter and enthusiastic promoter of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. His ''Notes on Rubik's \"Magic Cube\"'' which he began compiling in 1979 provided the first mathematical analysis of the Cube as well as providing one of the first published solutions. The book contained [[Singmaster notation|his cube notation]] which allowed the recording of [[Rubik's Cube]] moves, and which quickly became the standard.\n\nHe is both a [[puzzle]] historian and a composer of puzzles, and many of his puzzles have been published in newspapers and magazines.

A self-described [[Metagrobology|metagrobologist]], he has a huge personal collection of [[mechanical puzzle]]s and books of [[brain teaser]]s. He is most famous for being an early adopter and enthusiastic promoter of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. His ''Notes on Rubik's \"Magic Cube\"'' which he began compiling in 1979 provided the first mathematical analysis of the Cube as well as providing one of the first published solutions. The book contained [[Singmaster notation|his cube notation]] which allowed the recording of [[Rubik's Cube]] moves, and which quickly became the standard.\n\nHe is both a [[puzzle]] historian and a composer of puzzles, and many of his puzzles have been published in newspapers and magazines. In [[combinatorial number theory]], [[Singmaster's conjecture]] states that there is an upper bound on the number of times a number other than 1 can appear in [[Pascal's triangle]].\n\n==Career==\nDavid Singmaster was a student at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in the late 1950s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/449/1/1958_02_20_59_17.pdf|title=Candidates' statements - treasurer|page=9|publisher=The California Tech|date=20 February 1958}}</ref> His intention was to become a civil engineer, but he became interested in chemistry and then physics.<ref name=\"twisty\"/><ref name=\"g4g2018\">{{cite interview |last=Singmaster |first=David |subject= |subject-link= |interviewer=Dana Richards |title=An Interview with David Singmaster |type= |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=abWpHc1XGyo |format= |work=G4G Celebration |publisher=[[Gathering 4 Gardner]] |location= |date=April 2018 |access-date=25 June 2018 |quote=}}</ref> However he was thrown out of college in his third year for \"lack of academic ability\".<ref name=\"g4g2018\"/> After a year working, he switched to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"g4g2018\"/> He only became really interested in mathematics in his final year when he took some courses in [[algebra]] and [[number theory]].<ref name=\"twisty\"/> In the autumn semester, his number theory teacher [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Dick Lehmer]] posed a prize problem which Singmaster won.<ref name=\"twisty\"/><ref name=\"g4g2018\"/> In his last semester, his algebra teacher posed a question the teacher didn't know the answer to and Singmaster solved it, eventually leading to two papers.<ref name=\"twisty\"/> He gained his [[PhD]] from Berkeley, in 1966.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=32103}}</ref>\n\nSingmaster moved to [[London]] in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.footnotesaudiowalks.co.uk/about.php|title=About the Footnotes team|publisher=Footnotes audio walks|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> The \"Polytechnic of the South Bank\" had been created from a merger of institutions in 1970, and Singmaster became a lecturer in the department of Mathematical Sciences.<ref name=\"morallessons\"/>\n\nAround 1972 he attended the Istituto di Matematica in [[Pisa]] for a year having won a research scholarship.<ref name=\"twisty\"/> He was promoted to a Readership (a Research Professorship) at the South Bank polytechnic in September 1984.<ref name=\"circ78\"/> The polytechnic became [[London South Bank University]] in 1992, and Singmaster was the professor of mathematics at the \"School of Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics\".
