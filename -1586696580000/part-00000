{"title_page": "Culture of the Netherlands", "text_new": "[[File:Hollande04.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture.]]\n{{Culture of the Netherlands}}\n{{Life in the Netherlands}}\nThe '''culture of the Netherlands''' is diverse, reflecting regional differences as well as the foreign influences built up by centuries of the [[Dutch people]]'s [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] and [[Exploration|explorative]] spirit. The [[Netherlands]] and its people have long played an important role as centre of cultural liberali00o0ooodjssdicciddocb. The [[Dutch Golden Age]] is popularly regarded as its zenith.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Languages of the Netherlands|Dutch dialects}}\n[[File:Dutcharea.png|left|220px|thumb|A map illustrating the area in which Dutch is spoken.]]\nThe [[official language]] of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is also spoken and official in [[Aruba]], [[Brussels]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Flanders]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Suriname]]. It is a [[West Germanic]], [[Low Franconian]] language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is also a recognized language and it is used by the government in the province of [[Friesland]]. Several dialects of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] (''Nedersaksisch'' in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another Dutch dialect granted the status of regional language is [[Limburgish]], which is spoken in the south-eastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. However, both [[Dutch Low Saxon]] and [[Limburgish]] spread across the Dutch-German border and belong to a common Dutch-[[Low German]] [[dialect continuum]].\n\nLastly, a [[sister language]] of Dutch, [[Afrikaans]], has emerged in recent years. Originally an amalgamation of languages used on the ports of [[Cape Town]] by employees of the United East India Company\u00a0(Dutch:\u00a0Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie;\u00a0VOC), the language developed from a 16th-century Lingua Franca (only shortly after the first Dutch Bible translation in 1637) into a myriad of local dialects (including variations spoken by populations of Khoi). During the time of the [[Boer Republics]], some populations favoured [[Modern Dutch]], while others identified more closely with \"kitchen Dutch\". At the height of the unity of these Republics, a language almost 300 years in the making (consisting of isolated [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Khoi]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[French language|French]] etc. influence) underwent broad reformation (which included the adoption of some synthetic attributes) into the established language recognised as such today. Following the reformation, Afrikaans shares a notably large lexicon with Modern Dutch, confusing many novice linguists into mistakingly classifying Afrikaans a daughter language of Modern Dutch (though this may arguably be a case of [[hubris]]).\n\nThere is a tradition of learning foreign languages in the Netherlands: about 89% of the total population have good knowledge of [[English language|English]], 70% of [[German language|German]], 29% of [[French language|French]] and 5% of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:St Servaas 20080913 choir.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] (built 570) in Maastricht is the oldest church in the Netherlands.]]\n[[File:Nederlandgodsdienst1849-en.PNG|thumb|Dutch religion in 1849]]\n{{Pie chart\n|caption = Beliefs in the Netherlands (2015)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5091/Religie/article/detail/3830831/2015/01/16/Ongelovigen-halen-de-gelovigen-in.dhtml|title=Ongelovigen halen de gelovigen in|website=Trouw|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Atheism]]\n|value1 = 25\n|color1 = Gold\n|label2 = [[Agnostic]]\n|value2 = 31\n|color2 = Skyblue\n|label3 = [[Ietsism]]\n|value3 = 27\n|color3 = Forestgreen\n|label4 = [[Theism]]\n|value4 = 17\n|color4 = Orangered\n}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religions in the Netherlands (2015)<ref name=\"BerntsA\"/>\n|label1 = [[Irreligion]]\n|value1 = 67.8\n|color1 = Gold\n|label2 = [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]\n|value2 = 11.7\n|color2 = DarkOrchid\n|label3 = [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]]\n|value3 = 8.6\n|color3 = DodgerBlue\n|label5 =  [[Islam in the Netherlands|Islam]]\n|value5 = 5.8\n|color5 = Green\n|label4 = Other Christian denominations \n|value4 = 4.2\n|color4 = Red\n|label6 = [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]\n|value6 = 2.0\n|color6 = Turquoise\n}}\n{{main|Religion in the Netherlands}}\nBetween the Celtic and Germanic peoples and later the Roman conquerors a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and each other's myths took place among the various tribes, coming from the Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. From the 4th to the 6th century AD [[Migration Period|The Great Migration]] took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the [[Franks]], the [[Frisians]] and the [[Saxons]]. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the [[Somme river|Somme]] embraced [[Christianity]] under the auspices of King [[Clovis I]]. However, it would take at least until AD 1000 before all the pagans were actually Christianized and the Frisian and Saxon religions became extinct, although elements were incorporated into the local [[Christian religion]]. The following centuries Catholic Christianity was the only mainstream religion in the Netherlands.\nThe rebellious Netherlands that had united in the [[Union of Utrecht]] (1579) declared their independence from [[Spain]] in 1581, during the [[Eighty Years' War]]; Spain finally accepted this in 1648. The Dutch revolt was partially religiously motivated: during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] many of the Dutch had adopted [[Lutheran]], [[Anabaptist]], [[Calvinist]] or [[Mennonite]] forms of [[Protestantism]]. These religious movements were suppressed by the Spanish, who supported the [[Counter Reformation]]. After independence the Netherlands adopted [[Calvinism]] as a quasi [[state religion]] (although never formally), but practiced a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Calvinists.\n\nThe predominant religion in the Netherlands was [[Christianity]] until late into the 20th century. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline in religious adherence. In 2006, 34% of the Dutch population identified as Christian,<ref name=\"nos.nl\">{{cite news|title=Hoe God (bijna) verdween uit Nederland|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2092498-hoe-god-bijna-verdween-uit-nederland.html|accessdate=3 April 2016|publisher=NOS|date=13 March 2016}}</ref> decreasing till in 2015 almost 25% of the population adhered to one of the Christian faiths (11.7% Roman Catholic, 8.6% PKN, 4.2% other small Christian denominations), 5% is Muslim and 2% adheres to Hinduism or Buddhism, based on independent in-depth interviewing by [[Radboud University]] and [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"BerntsA\"/> Approximately 67.8% of the population in 2015 has [[irreligion|no religious affiliation]], up from 61% in 2006, 53% in 1996, 43% 1979 and 33% in 1966.<ref name=\"BerntsA\"/> The Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (Social and Cultural Planning Agency, SCP) expects the number of non-affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020.<ref>Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, God in Nederland (2006/2007)</ref>\n\nA large majority of the Dutch population believes that religion should not have a determining role to play in politics and education.

(2006)</ref>\nThe Dutch constitution guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], and two small parties, [[ChristianUnion]] and [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]]) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, [[Pentecost]] and the [[Ascension of Jesus]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beleven.org/feesten/lijsten/landen.php?land=Nederland |title=Feestdagen Nederland |publisher=Beleven.org |accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> In the late 19th century atheism began to rise as secularism, [[Pillarisation|liberalism and socialism]] grew; in the 1960s and 1970s Protestantism and Catholicism notably began to decline.

The provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and some of their people might still consider the Catholic Church as a base for their [[Cultural Christian|cultural identity]]. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (PKN), a [[United and uniting churches|United]] church which is [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] in orientation.<ref name=\"CBS 2009\">{{cite news |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37944&D1=0-5,10&D2=29-40&VW=T |title=Kerkelijke gezindte en kerkbezoek; vanaf 1849; 18 jaar of ouder |date=15 October 2010}}</ref> It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands|a smaller Lutheran Church]].

Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are [[Indo-Surinamese]]. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and some Western adherents of [[Hinduism in the West|Hinduism-oriented new religious movements]] such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] in the Netherlands.\n\n==Art and media==\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Dutch art}}\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''View of Delft'' ([[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]) 1660-1661]]\n[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the seventeenth century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the [[Baroque]] style typified by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in neighboring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, [[still life]]s and [[Genre works|genre painting]]s. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1672, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.\n\nDutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting him/her be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century. A great many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city's civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The amount paid determined each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western seacoast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.\n\n[[File:Van Gogh - Starry Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Starry Night]]'', 1889, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City]]\nThe [[Hague School]] were around at the start of the nineteenth century. They showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] was current during the middle of the Nineteenth century at about the same time as [[French Impressionism]]. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. [[Vincent van Gogh]] was a [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. In the 20th century, the Netherlands produced many fine painters and artists including (but not limited to): [[Roelof Frankot]], [[Salomon Garf]], [[Pyke Koch]] and many more. Around 1905-1910 pointillism was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including [[cubism]], [[futurism]] and [[expressionism]]. After World War I, [[De Stijl]] (''the style'') was led by [[Piet Mondrian]] and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colors.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{main|Architecture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|left|thumb|210px|''Koninklijk Paleis'' (Royale Palace) by [[Jacob van Campen]]]]\n\nThe [[Dutch Golden Age]] roughly spanned the 17th century. Due to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls and storehouses were built, and many new canals were dug out in and around various cities such as [[Delft]], [[Leiden]] and [[Amsterdam]] for defence and transport purposes. Many wealthy merchants had a new house built along these canals. These houses were generally very narrow and had ornamented fa\u00e7ades that befitted their new status. The reason they were narrow was because a house was taxed on the width of the fa\u00e7ade. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was marked by sobriety and restraint, and was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from [[classical antiquity]]. In general, architecture in the [[Low Countries]], both in the [[Counter-Reformation]]-influenced [[Spanish Netherlands|south]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] forms that predated the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Baroque architecture|High Baroque]] style of [[Borromini]] and [[Bernini]]. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the [[House of Orange]] and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in [[Antwerp]]. At the end of the 19th century there was a remarkable [[neo-gothic]] stream or [[Gothic Revival]] both in church and in public architecture, notably by the Roman Catholic [[Pierre Cuypers]], who was inspired by the Frenchman [[Viollet le Duc]]. The Amsterdam [[Rijksmuseum]] (1876\u20131885) and [[Amsterdam Centraal]] Station (1881\u20131889) belong to his main buildings.\n\n[[File:HilversumCityHall-front.jpg|thumb|210px|Hilversum City Hall by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]]]]\nDuring the 20th century Dutch architects played a leading role in the development of modern architecture. Out of the early 20th century rationalist architecture of [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], architect of the [[Beurs van Berlage]], three separate groups developed during the 1920s, each with their own view on which direction modern architecture should take. Expressionist architects like M. de Klerk and P.J. Kramer in [[Amsterdam]] (''See [[Amsterdam School]]''). Functionalist architects (''[[Nieuwe Zakelijkheid]]'' or ''Nieuwe Bouwen'') like [[Mart Stam]], L.C. van der Vlugt, [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and Johannes Duiker had good ties with the international modernist group [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]]. A third group came out of the [[De Stijl]] movement, among them J.J.P Oud and [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. Both architects later built in a functionalist style. During the '50s and '60s a new generation of architects like [[Aldo van Eyck]], [[J.B. Bakema]] and Herman Hertzberger, known as the \u2018Forum generation\u2019 (named after a magazine called Forum) formed a connection with international groups like [[Team 10]]. From the '80s to the present [[Rem Koolhaas]] and his [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture]] (OMA) became one of the leading world architects. With him, formed a new generation of Dutch architects working in a modernist tradition.\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Dutch literature}}\n[[File:Eduard Douwes Dekker - 001.jpg|frame|210px|Eduard Douwes Dekker, also known as [[Multatuli]]]]\nSome of the most important and internationally awarded writers are:\n\n16th Century:\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]]\n17th Century:\n* [[Baruch de Spinoza]]\n* [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]]\n* [[Joost van den Vondel]]\n19th Century:\n* [[Multatuli]]\n20th Century:\n* [[Louis Couperus]]\n* [[Martinus Nijhoff]]\n* [[Simon Vestdijk]]\n* [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]\n* [[Gerard Reve]]\n* [[Hella Haasse]]\n* [[Harry Mulisch]]\n* [[Jan Wolkers]]\n* [[Cees Nooteboom]]\n\n===Comic strips===\n{{main|Dutch comics}}\nThe Dutch have a distinct [[comics|comic book]] tradition as well.

Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and the late [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n[[Image:Anouk at fesival mundial 2008.JPG|thumb|Rock singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] at Festival Mundial in 2008]]\nMore than most other non-English speaking European countries, the Netherlands has remained closely in tune with American and British trends since the 1950s. Contemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], (the) [[Golden Earring]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.<br />\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Within Temptation]], as well as [[Jazz]] / pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having some international success. Contemporary local heroes include rock singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]], country pop singer [[Ilse DeLange]], rock band [[Kane (Dutch band)|Kane]] and Dutch language duo [[Nick & Simon]].\n\nEarly 1990s Dutch and [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[house music]] came together in [[Eurodance]] project [[2 Unlimited]].

Tracks like \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the 21st century, artists with North African, Caribbean and Middle Eastern origins have profoundly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s Dutch [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance music (EDM)]] conquered the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]].

It is celebrated on the evening before Sinterklaas' birthday on December 5, especially in families with little children. Sinterklaas has a companion known as [[Zwarte Piet]], which in recent years has come under scrutiny in light of accusations of racist caricatures.

Beschuit is a typical Dutch type of biscuit, muisjes are sugared [[anise]] seeds.

This holiday is celebrated in some parts of [[Groningen]], [[North Holland]] and the southern and middle part of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and to a lesser extent in [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].

The southern regions of the Netherlands for example share dishes with Flanders and vice versa. The Southern Dutch cuisine is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an [[haute cuisine]], as it is influenced by both [[German cuisine]] and [[French cuisine]], and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants. Dutch food is traditionally characterized by the high consumption of vegetables when compared to the consumption of meat. Dairy products are also eaten to great extent, Dutch cheeses are world-renowned with famous cheeses such as [[Gouda cheese|Gouda]], [[Edam cheese|Edam]] and [[Leyden cheese|Leiden]]. Dutch pastry is extremely rich and is eaten in great quantities. When it comes to alcoholic beverages wine has long been absent in Dutch cuisine (but this is changing during the last decades); traditionally there are many brands of [[beer]] and strong alcoholic spirits such as [[jenever]] and [[Brandy|brandewijn]].\nThe Dutch have all sorts of pastry and cookies (the word \"''[[cookie]]''\" is in fact derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), many of them filled with marzipan, almond and chocolate. A truly huge amount of different [[pie]]s and [[cake]]s can be found, most notably in the southern provinces, especially the so-called Limburgish ''vlaai''.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in the Netherlands}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Notable Dutch football teams and clubs include: [[AFC Ajax|Amsterdamsche Football club Ajax]] in 1900, [[Feyenoord|Feyenoord Rotterdam]] in 1908 and [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 1913.\n\nAnother almost national sport is [[speedskating]]. It is common for Northern Dutch children to learn how to skate at an early age. Long distance skating and all-round tournaments are the most popular and most successful areas for the Dutch. In the history of the world championships the champion of the 10&nbsp;km has always been a Dutchman. Notable athletes are [[Sven Kramer]], [[Rintje Ritsma]] and [[Ard Schenk]]\n\nAlso popular are swimming, field hockey, judo and cycling. {{Further|Netherlands national football team|Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands at the FIFA World Cup|Football in the Netherlands|Sport in the Netherlands}}\n\nA typical Dutch sport is \"[[korfball]]\", a mixed sport played by girls and boys.

The [[Netherlands]] and its people have long played an important role as centre of cultural liberalism and tolerance. The [[Dutch Golden Age]] is popularly regarded as its zenith.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Languages of the Netherlands|Dutch dialects}}\n[[File:Dutcharea.png|left|220px|thumb|A map illustrating the area in which Dutch is spoken.]]\nThe [[official language]] of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is also spoken and official in [[Aruba]], [[Brussels]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Flanders]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Suriname]]. It is a [[West Germanic]], [[Low Franconian]] language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is also a recognized language and it is used by the government in the province of [[Friesland]]. Several dialects of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] (''Nedersaksisch'' in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another Dutch dialect granted the status of regional language is [[Limburgish]], which is spoken in the south-eastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. However, both [[Dutch Low Saxon]] and [[Limburgish]] spread across the Dutch-German border and belong to a common Dutch-[[Low German]] [[dialect continuum]].\n\nLastly, a [[sister language]] of Dutch, [[Afrikaans]], has emerged in recent years. Originally an amalgamation of languages used on the ports of [[Cape Town]] by employees of the United East India Company\u00a0(Dutch:\u00a0Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie;\u00a0VOC), the language developed from a 16th-century Lingua Franca (only shortly after the first Dutch Bible translation in 1637) into a myriad of local dialects (including variations spoken by populations of Khoi). During the time of the [[Boer Republics]], some populations favoured [[Modern Dutch]], while others identified more closely with \"kitchen Dutch\". At the height of the unity of these Republics, a language almost 300 years in the making (consisting of isolated [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Khoi]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[French language|French]] etc. influence) underwent broad reformation (which included the adoption of some synthetic attributes) into the established language recognised as such today. Following the reformation, Afrikaans shares a notably large lexicon with Modern Dutch, confusing many novice linguists into mistakingly classifying Afrikaans a daughter language of Modern Dutch (though this may arguably be a case of [[hubris]]).\n\nThere is a tradition of learning foreign languages in the Netherlands: about 89% of the total population have good knowledge of [[English language|English]], 70% of [[German language|German]], 29% of [[French language|French]] and 5% of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:St Servaas 20080913 choir.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] (built 570) in Maastricht is the oldest church in the Netherlands.]]\n[[File:Nederlandgodsdienst1849-en.PNG|thumb|Dutch religion in 1849]]\n{{Pie chart\n|caption = Beliefs in the Netherlands (2015)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5091/Religie/article/detail/3830831/2015/01/16/Ongelovigen-halen-de-gelovigen-in.dhtml|title=Ongelovigen halen de gelovigen in|website=Trouw|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Atheism]]\n|value1 = 25\n|color1 = Gold\n|label2 = [[Agnostic]]\n|value2 = 31\n|color2 = Skyblue\n|label3 = [[Ietsism]]\n|value3 = 27\n|color3 = Forestgreen\n|label4 = [[Theism]]\n|value4 = 17\n|color4 = Orangered\n}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religions in the Netherlands (2015)<ref name=\"BerntsA\"/>\n|label1 = [[Irreligion]]\n|value1 = 67.8\n|color1 = Gold\n|label2 = [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]\n|value2 = 11.7\n|color2 = DarkOrchid\n|label3 = [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]]\n|value3 = 8.6\n|color3 = DodgerBlue\n|label5 =  [[Islam in the Netherlands|Islam]]\n|value5 = 5.8\n|color5 = Green\n|label4 = Other Christian denominations \n|value4 = 4.2\n|color4 = Red\n|label6 = [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]\n|value6 = 2.0\n|color6 = Turquoise\n}}\n{{main|Religion in the Netherlands}}\nBetween the Celtic and Germanic peoples and later the Roman conquerors a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and each other's myths took place among the various tribes, coming from the Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. From the 4th to the 6th century AD [[Migration Period|The Great Migration]] took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the [[Franks]], the [[Frisians]] and the [[Saxons]]. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the [[Somme river|Somme]] embraced [[Christianity]] under the auspices of King [[Clovis I]]. However, it would take at least until AD 1000 before all the pagans were actually Christianized and the Frisian and Saxon religions became extinct, although elements were incorporated into the local [[Christian religion]]. The following centuries Catholic Christianity was the only mainstream religion in the Netherlands.\nThe rebellious Netherlands that had united in the [[Union of Utrecht]] (1579) declared their independence from [[Spain]] in 1581, during the [[Eighty Years' War]]; Spain finally accepted this in 1648. The Dutch revolt was partially religiously motivated: during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] many of the Dutch had adopted [[Lutheran]], [[Anabaptist]], [[Calvinist]] or [[Mennonite]] forms of [[Protestantism]]. These religious movements were suppressed by the Spanish, who supported the [[Counter Reformation]]. After independence the Netherlands adopted [[Calvinism]] as a quasi [[state religion]] (although never formally), but practiced a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Calvinists.\n\nThe predominant religion in the Netherlands was [[Christianity]] until late into the 20th century. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline in religious adherence.

Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], and two small parties, [[ChristianUnion]] and [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]]) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, [[Pentecost]] and the [[Ascension of Jesus]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beleven.org/feesten/lijsten/landen.php?land=Nederland |title=Feestdagen Nederland |publisher=Beleven.org |accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> In the late 19th century atheism began to rise as secularism, [[Pillarisation|liberalism and socialism]] grew; in the 1960s and 1970s Protestantism and Catholicism notably began to decline.

The largest of these is the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (PKN), a [[United and uniting churches|United]] church which is [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] in orientation.<ref name=\"CBS 2009\">{{cite news |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37944&D1=0-5,10&D2=29-40&VW=T |title=Kerkelijke gezindte en kerkbezoek; vanaf 1849; 18 jaar of ouder |date=15 October 2010}}</ref> It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands|a smaller Lutheran Church]]. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]] from [[Zeeland]] to the northern parts of the province [[Overijssel]], in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.\n \n[[Islam]] is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslims]] in the Netherlands (5% of the population).<ref name=CBS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/vrije-tijd-cultuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3759-wm.htm|title=Een op de zes bezoekt regelmatig kerk of moskee|work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands|year=2012|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref> Muslim numbers increased from the 1960 as a consequence of large numbers of [[Demographics of the Netherlands#Im- and Emigration|migrant workers]]. This included migrants from former [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]], such as [[Surinam]] and [[Indonesia]], but mainly migrant workers from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]]. During the 1990s, [[Muslim refugees]] arrived from countries like [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], and [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scp.nl/publicaties/boeken/9037702597/Godsdienstige_veranderingen.pdf |title=Godsdienstige veranderingen in Nederland |format=PDF |accessdate=17 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070125142251/http://www.scp.nl/publicaties/boeken/9037702597/Godsdienstige_veranderingen.pdf |archivedate = 25 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nOther religions account for some 6% of the Dutch people. Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are [[Indo-Surinamese]]. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and some Western adherents of [[Hinduism in the West|Hinduism-oriented new religious movements]] such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] in the Netherlands.\n\n==Art and media==\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Dutch art}}\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''View of Delft'' ([[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]) 1660-1661]]\n[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the seventeenth century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the [[Baroque]] style typified by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in neighboring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, [[still life]]s and [[Genre works|genre painting]]s. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1672, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.\n\nDutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting him/her be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century. A great many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city's civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The amount paid determined each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western seacoast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.\n\n[[File:Van Gogh - Starry Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Starry Night]]'', 1889, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City]]\nThe [[Hague School]] were around at the start of the nineteenth century. They showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] was current during the middle of the Nineteenth century at about the same time as [[French Impressionism]]. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. [[Vincent van Gogh]] was a [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. In the 20th century, the Netherlands produced many fine painters and artists including (but not limited to): [[Roelof Frankot]], [[Salomon Garf]], [[Pyke Koch]] and many more. Around 1905-1910 pointillism was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including [[cubism]], [[futurism]] and [[expressionism]]. After World War I, [[De Stijl]] (''the style'') was led by [[Piet Mondrian]] and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colors.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{main|Architecture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|left|thumb|210px|''Koninklijk Paleis'' (Royale Palace) by [[Jacob van Campen]]]]\n\nThe [[Dutch Golden Age]] roughly spanned the 17th century. Due to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls and storehouses were built, and many new canals were dug out in and around various cities such as [[Delft]], [[Leiden]] and [[Amsterdam]] for defence and transport purposes. Many wealthy merchants had a new house built along these canals. These houses were generally very narrow and had ornamented fa\u00e7ades that befitted their new status. The reason they were narrow was because a house was taxed on the width of the fa\u00e7ade. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was marked by sobriety and restraint, and was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from [[classical antiquity]]. In general, architecture in the [[Low Countries]], both in the [[Counter-Reformation]]-influenced [[Spanish Netherlands|south]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] forms that predated the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Baroque architecture|High Baroque]] style of [[Borromini]] and [[Bernini]]. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the [[House of Orange]] and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in [[Antwerp]]. At the end of the 19th century there was a remarkable [[neo-gothic]] stream or [[Gothic Revival]] both in church and in public architecture, notably by the Roman Catholic [[Pierre Cuypers]], who was inspired by the Frenchman [[Viollet le Duc]]. The Amsterdam [[Rijksmuseum]] (1876\u20131885) and [[Amsterdam Centraal]] Station (1881\u20131889) belong to his main buildings.\n\n[[File:HilversumCityHall-front.jpg|thumb|210px|Hilversum City Hall by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]]]]\nDuring the 20th century Dutch architects played a leading role in the development of modern architecture. Out of the early 20th century rationalist architecture of [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], architect of the [[Beurs van Berlage]], three separate groups developed during the 1920s, each with their own view on which direction modern architecture should take. Expressionist architects like M. de Klerk and P.J. Kramer in [[Amsterdam]] (''See [[Amsterdam School]]''). Functionalist architects (''[[Nieuwe Zakelijkheid]]'' or ''Nieuwe Bouwen'') like [[Mart Stam]], L.C. van der Vlugt, [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and Johannes Duiker had good ties with the international modernist group [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]]. A third group came out of the [[De Stijl]] movement, among them J.J.P Oud and [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. Both architects later built in a functionalist style. During the '50s and '60s a new generation of architects like [[Aldo van Eyck]], [[J.B. Bakema]] and Herman Hertzberger, known as the \u2018Forum generation\u2019 (named after a magazine called Forum) formed a connection with international groups like [[Team 10]]. From the '80s to the present [[Rem Koolhaas]] and his [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture]] (OMA) became one of the leading world architects. With him, formed a new generation of Dutch architects working in a modernist tradition.\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Dutch literature}}\n[[File:Eduard Douwes Dekker - 001.jpg|frame|210px|Eduard Douwes Dekker, also known as [[Multatuli]]]]\nSome of the most important and internationally awarded writers are:\n\n16th Century:\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]]\n17th Century:\n* [[Baruch de Spinoza]]\n* [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]]\n* [[Joost van den Vondel]]\n19th Century:\n* [[Multatuli]]\n20th Century:\n* [[Louis Couperus]]\n* [[Martinus Nijhoff]]\n* [[Simon Vestdijk]]\n* [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]\n* [[Gerard Reve]]\n* [[Hella Haasse]]\n* [[Harry Mulisch]]\n* [[Jan Wolkers]]\n* [[Cees Nooteboom]]\n\n===Comic strips===\n{{main|Dutch comics}}\nThe Dutch have a distinct [[comics|comic book]] tradition as well. Although there is an abundance of Flemish, [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]], and American comics, they also created their own. Examples are [[Agent 327|Secret agent 327]] and [[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]], written by [[Martin Lodewijk]] and [[Jack, Jacky and the Juniors]] by [[Jan Kruis]], as well as cartoons with a more literary style, like [[Viking]] series ''[[Eric de Noorman]]'' by [[Hans G. Kresse]] and ''Tom Poes & Heer Bommel'' ([[Tom Puss]]/[[Oliver B. Bumble]]) created by [[Marten Toonder]]. The nations love of football also translated into comics, like [[Roel Dijkstra]] and ''F.C. Knudde''.\n\nChildren's comic book series [[Miffy]] (Dutch: ''Nijntje'') by [[Dick Bruna]] has been published in over 50 languages,<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3557810/Dick-Bruna-creator-of-the-Miffy-books-talks-about-his-life-and-work.html |title=Dick Bruna, creator of the Miffy books, talks about his life and work |date=July 31, 2008 |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=18 September 2010 |location=London |first=H. |last=Harrod}}</ref> and predates the similarly drawn [[Hello Kitty]] by over ten years.\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{main|Music of the Netherlands|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles|Dance in the Netherlands}}\nThe Netherlands has multiple [[music]]al traditions, ranging from folk and dance to classical music and ballet. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and the late [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n[[Image:Anouk at fesival mundial 2008.JPG|thumb|Rock singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] at Festival Mundial in 2008]]\nMore than most other non-English speaking European countries, the Netherlands has remained closely in tune with American and British trends since the 1950s. Contemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], (the) [[Golden Earring]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.<br />\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Within Temptation]], as well as [[Jazz]] / pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having some international success. Contemporary local heroes include rock singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]], country pop singer [[Ilse DeLange]], rock band [[Kane (Dutch band)|Kane]] and Dutch language duo [[Nick & Simon]].\n\nEarly 1990s Dutch and [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[house music]] came together in [[Eurodance]] project [[2 Unlimited]].

Tracks like \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the 21st century, artists with North African, Caribbean and Middle Eastern origins have profoundly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s Dutch [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance music (EDM)]] conquered the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]].

Celebrated Dutch conductors, past and present, include [[Willem Mengelberg]], [[Eduard van Beinum]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Jac van Steen]] and [[Jaap van Zweden]]. Notable violinists are [[Janine Jansen]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Rieu]].

In [[North-Brabant]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and some other parts of the Netherlands people celebrate [[carnival in the Netherlands|Carnaval]] similar to the [[carnival]] of the German [[Rhineland]] and Belgium [[Flanders]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Dutch cuisine}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Stroopwafels 01.jpg|caption1=''[[Stroopwafel]]s'' (syrup waffles) are a treat consisting of waffles with caramel-like syrup filling in the middle.\n| image2 = Poffertjes-Melkhuis_(cropped).jpg|caption2=''[[Poffertjes]]'' are made in a special, so-called, ''[[skillet|poffertjespan]]''.\n| image3 = 13-06-27-gouda-by-RalfR-125.jpg|caption3=The [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] cheese market.\n| image4 = Bitterballen mosterd mayo.jpg|caption4=''[[Bitterballen]]'' are usually served with [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n}}\nDutch cuisine is characterized by its somewhat limited diversity; however, it varies greatly from region to region. The southern regions of the Netherlands for example share dishes with Flanders and vice versa. The Southern Dutch cuisine is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an [[haute cuisine]], as it is influenced by both [[German cuisine]] and [[French cuisine]], and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants. Dutch food is traditionally characterized by the high consumption of vegetables when compared to the consumption of meat. Dairy products are also eaten to great extent, Dutch cheeses are world-renowned with famous cheeses such as [[Gouda cheese|Gouda]], [[Edam cheese|Edam]] and [[Leyden cheese|Leiden]]. Dutch pastry is extremely rich and is eaten in great quantities. When it comes to alcoholic beverages wine has long been absent in Dutch cuisine (but this is changing during the last decades); traditionally there are many brands of [[beer]] and strong alcoholic spirits such as [[jenever]] and [[Brandy|brandewijn]].\nThe Dutch have all sorts of pastry and cookies (the word \"''[[cookie]]''\" is in fact derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), many of them filled with marzipan, almond and chocolate. A truly huge amount of different [[pie]]s and [[cake]]s can be found, most notably in the southern provinces, especially the so-called Limburgish ''vlaai''.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in the Netherlands}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Notable Dutch football teams and clubs include: [[AFC Ajax|Amsterdamsche Football club Ajax]] in 1900, [[Feyenoord|Feyenoord Rotterdam]] in 1908 and [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 1913.\n\nAnother almost national sport is [[speedskating]]. It is common for Northern Dutch children to learn how to skate at an early age. Long distance skating and all-round tournaments are the most popular and most successful areas for the Dutch. In the history of the world championships the champion of the 10&nbsp;km has always been a Dutchman. Notable athletes are [[Sven Kramer]], [[Rintje Ritsma]] and [[Ard Schenk]]\n\nAlso popular are swimming, field hockey, judo and cycling. {{Further|Netherlands national football team|Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands at the FIFA World Cup|Football in the Netherlands|Sport in the Netherlands}}\n\nA typical Dutch sport is \"[[korfball]]\", a mixed sport played by girls and boys. It's invented in the Netherlands, but now it's also played in countries such as Belgium, Germany and Japan. At the [[IKF Korfball World Championship]] the Dutch team has won in all cases except once.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calvinism]]\n* [[Dutch customs and etiquette]]\n* [[Dutch people]]\n* [[List of Dutch people]]\n* [[Atheism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Ad Welschen, 2000\u20132005: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam.\n\n==External links==\n* Architecture: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050423214556/http://www.archined.nl/archined/2.1.html?taal=en ArchiNed]\n* Cabaret: [http://netherlandsbynumbers.com/2015/02/25/dutch-cabaret-in-8-steps/ Dutch cabaret in 8 steps] article on 'The Netherlands by numbers' (2015)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203703/http://www.nlplanet.com/nlguides/dutch-culture NL Planet - Dutch Culture]\n\n{{Netherlands topics}}\n{{Culture of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Dutch culture]]\n", "name_user": "2806:106e:b:9b69:5034:4d25:d6dc:2cc0", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Netherlands"}

The erection of his magnificent tomb by [[Nicholas Brigham]] in 1556 (to where Chaucer's remains were then transferred) and the nearby burial of [[Edmund Spenser]] in 1599 began a tradition that still continues. The area also houses the tombs of several [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] and [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]]s of the Abbey, as well as the grave of [[Old Tom Parr|Thomas Parr]] who, it is said, died at the age of 152 in 1635 after having seen ten sovereigns on the throne.\n\nBurial or commemoration in the Abbey does not always occur at or soon after the time of death. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], for example, whose poetry was admired but who maintained a scandalous lifestyle, died in 1824 but was not given a memorial until 1969.  Even [[William Shakespeare]], buried at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1616, was not honoured with a monument until 1740 when one designed by [[William Kent]] was constructed in Poets' Corner (though shortly after Shakespeare's death [[William Basse]] had suggested Shakespeare should be buried there.) [[Samuel Horsley]], [[Dean of Westminster]] in 1796, was said to have tartly refused the request for actress [[Kitty Clive]] to be buried in the Abbey:\n:if we do not draw some line in this ''theatrical'' ambition to ''mortuary fame'', we shall soon make ''Westminster Abbey'' little better than a ''Gothic [[Green Room]]''!<ref>''The Times'', 26 March 1796, p. 3</ref>\n\nNot all poets appreciated memorialisation and [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]]'s epitaph for [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], who supposedly died in poverty, continued Butler's satiric tone:\n\n:While Butler, needy wretch, was yet alive,\n:No generous patron would a dinner give;\n:See him, when starv'd to death, and turn'd to dust,\n:Presented with a monumental bust.\n:The poet's fate is here in emblem shown,\n:He ask'd for bread, and he received a stone.\n\nSome of those buried in Poets' Corner also had memorials erected to them over or near their grave, either around the time of their death or later. In some cases, such as [[Joseph Addison]], the burial took place elsewhere in Westminster Abbey, with a memorial later erected in Poets' Corner. In some cases a full burial of a body took place, in other cases the body was cremated and the ashes buried. There are also cases where there was support for a particular individual to be buried in Poets' Corner, but the decision was made to bury them elsewhere in the Abbey, such as [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]. Other notable poets and writers, such as [[Aphra Behn]], are buried elsewhere in the Abbey. At least two of the memorials (both to individuals buried in Poets' Corner \u2013 [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Rowe]] and [[John Gay|Gay]]) were later moved to a location elsewhere in the Abbey due to the discovery of old paintings on the wall behind them.\n\n==Memorial types==\n\nThe memorials can take several forms. Some are stone slabs set in the floor with a name and inscription carved on them, while others are more elaborate and carved stone monuments, or hanging stone tablets, or memorial busts. Some are commemorated in groups, such as the joint memorial for the [[Bront\u00eb sisters]] (commissioned in 1939, but not unveiled until 1947 due to the war), the sixteen First World War poets inscribed on a stone floor slab and unveiled in 1985, and the four founders of the [[Royal Ballet]], commemorated together in 2009.<ref>[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/press/news/news/2009/november/a-service-to-dedicate-a-memorial-to-the-founders-of-the-royal-ballet A Service to Dedicate a Memorial to the Founders of the Royal Ballet], Westminster Abbey press release, November 2009, accessed 16 March 2010</ref>\n\nThe grave of [[Ben Jonson]] is not in Poets' Corner, but is in the north aisle of the nave. It has the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson\" ''(perhaps the original spelling)'' on the slab above it. It has been suggested that this could be read \"Orare Ben Johnson\" (pray for Ben Johnson), which would indicate a deathbed return to Catholicism, but the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".<ref name=DCWA>{{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = \n  | title = Monuments & Gravestones: Ben Jonson\n  | work = Westminster Abbey 1065 to today\n  | publisher = Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate =26 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 January 2008}}</ref> The fact that he was buried in an upright grave could be an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death<ref>[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J.

The erection of his magnificent tomb by [[Nicholas Brigham]] in 1556 (to where Chaucer's remains were then transferred) and the nearby burial of [[Edmund Spenser]] in 1599 began a tradition that still continues. The area also houses the tombs of several [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] and [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]]s of the Abbey, as well as the grave of [[Old Tom Parr|Thomas Parr]] who, it is said, died at the age of 152 in 1635 after having seen ten sovereigns on the throne.\n\nBurial or commemoration in the Abbey does not always occur at or soon after the time of death. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], for example, whose poetry was admired but who maintained a scandalous lifestyle, died in 1824 but was not given a memorial until 1969.  Even [[William Shakespeare]], buried at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1616, was not honoured with a monument until 1740 when one designed by [[William Kent]] was constructed in Poets' Corner (though shortly after Shakespeare's death [[William Basse]] had suggested Shakespeare should be buried there.) [[Samuel Horsley]], [[Dean of Westminster]] in 1796, was said to have tartly refused the request for actress [[Kitty Clive]] to be buried in the Abbey:\n:if we do not draw some line in this ''theatrical'' ambition to ''mortuary fame'', we shall soon make ''Westminster Abbey'' little better than a ''Gothic [[Green Room]]''!<ref>''The Times'', 26 March 1796, p. 3</ref>\n\nNot all poets appreciated memorialisation and [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]]'s epitaph for [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], who supposedly died in poverty, continued Butler's satiric tone:\n\n:While Butler, needy wretch, was yet alive,\n:No generous patron would a dinner give;\n:See him, when starv'd to death, and turn'd to dust,\n:Presented with a monumental bust.\n:The poet's fate is here in emblem shown,\n:He ask'd for bread, and he received a stone.\n\nSome of those buried in Poets' Corner also had memorials erected to them over or near their grave, either around the time of their death or later. In some cases, such as [[Joseph Addison]], the burial took place elsewhere in Westminster Abbey, with a memorial later erected in Poets' Corner. In some cases a full burial of a body took place, in other cases the body was cremated and the ashes buried. There are also cases where there was support for a particular individual to be buried in Poets' Corner, but the decision was made to bury them elsewhere in the Abbey, such as [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]. Other notable poets and writers, such as [[Aphra Behn]], are buried elsewhere in the Abbey. At least two of the memorials (both to individuals buried in Poets' Corner \u2013 [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Rowe]] and [[John Gay|Gay]]) were later moved to a location elsewhere in the Abbey due to the discovery of old paintings on the wall behind them.\n\n==Memorial types==\n\nThe memorials can take several forms. Some are stone slabs set in the floor with a name and inscription carved on them, while others are more elaborate and carved stone monuments, or hanging stone tablets, or memorial busts. Some are commemorated in groups, such as the joint memorial for the [[Bront\u00eb sisters]] (commissioned in 1939, but not unveiled until 1947 due to the war), the sixteen First World War poets inscribed on a stone floor slab and unveiled in 1985, and the four founders of the [[Royal Ballet]], commemorated together in 2009.<ref>[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/press/news/news/2009/november/a-service-to-dedicate-a-memorial-to-the-founders-of-the-royal-ballet A Service to Dedicate a Memorial to the Founders of the Royal Ballet], Westminster Abbey press release, November 2009, accessed 16 March 2010</ref>\n\nThe grave of [[Ben Jonson]] is not in Poets' Corner, but is in the north aisle of the nave. It has the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson\" ''(perhaps the original spelling)'' on the slab above it. It has been suggested that this could be read \"Orare Ben Johnson\" (pray for Ben Johnson), which would indicate a deathbed return to Catholicism, but the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".<ref name=DCWA>{{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = \n  | title = Monuments & Gravestones: Ben Jonson\n  | work = Westminster Abbey 1065 to today\n  | publisher = Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate =26 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 January 2008}}</ref> The fact that he was buried in an upright grave could be an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death<ref>[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J.

As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')<ref name=\"TeKaraka\"/>\n\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui.

Te Hikutawatawa would later visit Waimea seeking to learn of his heritage. Te Hikutawatawa was outraged his [[mana]] being defiled by T\u016bmaro's father Kahukura-te-paku, and returned to destroy the site, killing everyone.

After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself.

She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.\n\nFighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. In 1834 Chief Iwikau of Ng\u0101ti Rangi\u0101moa (senior line of Ng\u0101i Tuahuriri), brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the [[Marlborough Sounds]], though Ng\u0101ti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found.

One of the Act's provisions covered the use of dual (M\u0101ori and English) names for geographical locations in the Ng\u0101i Tahu tribal area. The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987). ''A word-list of South Island Maori''. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand. {{ISBN|0-9597603-2-6}}</ref> However, from the 20th century until the early 21st century the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.<ref>Harlow, R.B. (1979). \"\"Regional Variation in Maori\". ''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')<ref name=\"TeKaraka\"/>\n\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui. This would send the remaining children to go to a place called Te Oreorehua in [[Wairarapa]] where Hinehou was already living, and onward to [[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]] within a few generations.<ref name=\"TeKaraka\"/>\n\n===17th century===\nA senier chief, Te Aohikuraki, the grandson of T\u016bhaitara, slept with R\u0101kaitekura, a high ranking Ng\u0101i Tahu woman while her husband T\u016bmaro was away visiting his family.

After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two tribes.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with [[Rangit\u0101ne]], Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]].

One of the Act's provisions covered the use of dual (M\u0101ori and English) names for geographical locations in the Ng\u0101i Tahu tribal area. The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987). ''A word-list of South Island Maori''. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand. {{ISBN|0-9597603-2-6}}</ref> However, from the 20th century until the early 21st century the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.<ref>Harlow, R.B. (1979). \"\"Regional Variation in Maori\". ''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

It is based on their [[soundtrack]] for the French film ''[[La Vall\u00e9e (film)|La Vall\u00e9e]]'', by [[Barbet Schroeder]]. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while they were in the midst of touring, and produced by the band members.\n\nThe album is shorter than some of their previous material, and makes heavy use of the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the songs centre around love, a common theme in the film it was inspired by. The album's only single was \"[[Free Four]]\". ''Obscured by Clouds'' has been seen as a stopgap for the band, who had started work on their next album, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973). The work is often overlooked in the band canon, primarily because of the success of their later material. Nevertheless, the album reached number six in the UK and number 46 in the US, and retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been positive, with some critics noting the similarities to their later material.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1972, [[Pink Floyd]] had recorded the soundtracks to the films ''[[The Committee (film)|The Committee]]'' (1968) and ''[[More (1969 film)|More]]'' (1969),{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=164}} and part of ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970). On the back of ''More''{{'}}s success, its director [[Barbet Schroeder]] asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}} The new film, ''[[La Vall\u00e9e (film)|La Vall\u00e9e]]'', featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in [[New Guinea]], and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music.{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}} The group had already started working on another album, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]], France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=155}} The album was then mixed from 4\u20136 April at [[Morgan Sound Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=166}}\n\nAs they had done on ''More'', the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be cross-faded at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable without the need for any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=164}} Drummer [[Nick Mason]] recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}}\n\nDuring the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station [[Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise|ORTF]] filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with bassist [[Roger Waters]] and guitarist [[David Gilmour]].{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=166}} In a snippet of interview footage at [[Abbey Road Studios]] that appeared in the 1974 theatrical version (later released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] and subsequent \"Director's Cut\" [[DVD]]) of ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'', Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained excessive [[Sibilant consonant|sibilance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2012/11/1972-pink-floyd-obc/|title=Obscured by Clouds by Pink Floyd|publisher=Classic Rock Review|date=November 2012|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as ''Obscured by Clouds'', rather than ''La Vall\u00e9e''. In response, the film was retitled ''La Vall\u00e9e (Obscured by Clouds)'' on its release.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}}\n\n==Songs==\nThe songs on ''Obscured by Clouds'' are all short and economical, in contrast to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong [[country music]] influence was present on several tracks, with prominent use of [[acoustic guitar]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=183}} The album also featured the [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}}\n\nThe title track made prominent use of the VCS 3, and featured Mason playing electronic drums.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}} The following track, \"When You're In\" is similar in style; its title came from a phrase said by roadie Chris Adamson.{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}} The two pieces were played back-to-back live in late 1972 and on the 1973 tours.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=114}} They were also part of the set used for the group's collaboration with [[Roland Petit]] and the [[Ballet National de Marseille]] at the Palais de Sports, Paris, in early 1973.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=173}}\n\n\"Burning Bridges\" was one of two songwriting collaborations on the album between keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] (who wrote the music) and Waters (who wrote the lyrics).{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=114}} \"[[Wot's... Uh the Deal?]]\" was a straightforward acoustic piece. It was never performed live by Pink Floyd, but Gilmour resurrected the piece for his solo tour in 2006.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=115}} One of these performances features on Gilmour's 2007 DVD ''[[Remember That Night]]''{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=303}} and also the vinyl version of his 2008 live album, ''[[Live in Gda\u0144sk]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/live-in-gdansk-mr0001696751|title=David Gilmour : Live in Gda\u0144sk (LP)|website=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Childhood's End (Pink Floyd song)|Childhood's End]]\" was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour until the release of ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'' in 1987. The title may have been derived from the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel [[Childhood's End|of the same name]]. It was performed live at a few gigs in late 1972 and early the following year; the drum pattern opening the track was recycled for \"Time\" on ''The Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=117\u20138}}\n\n\"[[Free Four]]\" was the first Pink Floyd song since \"[[See Emily Play]]\" to attract significant airplay in the US,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=165}} and the second (after \"[[Corporal Clegg]]\" from ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'')<ref name=\"Mabbett2\">{{Cite book|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=0-7119-4301-X|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of Pink Floyd|location=London|year=1995}}</ref> to deal with the death of Waters' father during World War II.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=165}}<ref>{{Allmusic |class=song |id=t1530656 |tab= |label=Song review |first=Stewart |last=Mason |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> The title is derived from the count-in \"One, two, 'free, four!\", spoken in a [[Cockney]] accent.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=118}} The track was released as a single in the US, as the band felt it was suitable for [[AM radio]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=184}}\n\n\"Stay\" was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. It is superficially a love song, except the protagonist cannot remember the girl's name, suggesting she might have been a [[groupie]].{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=118}} \n\n\"Absolutely Curtains\", the closing instrumental on the album, ends with a recording of the [[Mapuga]] tribe, as seen in the film.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=155}}\n\n==Cover==\nThe album's cover was, like several other Pink Floyd albums, designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] of [[Hipgnosis]]. It consists of a photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=113}}{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=184}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"am\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2043589|tab=review|label=Album review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = C<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0-89919-025-1|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2773|chapter=Pink Floyd: ''Obscured by Clouds''|accessdate=26 April 2017|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00robe_1}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Neil|date=20 May 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8790376/Pink-Floyds-14-studio-albums-rated.html|title=Pink Floyd's 14 studio albums rated|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=2011 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=9780857125958 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=RA3-PA2005-IA45&dq=Tomorrow+(Hugh+Masekela+album)&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3xcKoivjhAhXuk4sKHRs4DnkQ6AEILjAB#v=snippet&q=pink%20floyd&f=false |accessdate=22 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''\n| rev5Score = 7.0/10<ref name=\"paste\">{{cite magazine|last=Deusner|first=Stephen|date=6 October 2011|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/10/pink-floyd-obscured-by-clouds-why-pink-floyd-reiss.html|title=Pink Floyd: ''Obscured by Clouds'' ('Why Pink Floyd?'

It is based on their [[soundtrack]] for the French film ''[[La Vall\u00e9e (film)|La Vall\u00e9e]]'', by [[Barbet Schroeder]]. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while they were in the midst of touring, and produced by the band members.\n\nThe album is shorter than some of their previous material, and makes heavy use of the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the songs centre around love, a common theme in the film it was inspired by. The album's only single was \"[[Free Four]]\". ''Obscured by Clouds'' has been seen as a stopgap for the band, who had started work on their next album, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973). The work is often overlooked in the band canon, primarily because of the success of their later material. Nevertheless, the album reached number six in the UK and number 46 in the US, and retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been positive, with some critics noting the similarities to their later material.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1972, [[Pink Floyd]] had recorded the soundtracks to the films ''[[The Committee (film)|The Committee]]'' (1968) and ''[[More (1969 film)|More]]'' (1969),{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=164}} and part of ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970). On the back of ''More''{{'}}s success, its director [[Barbet Schroeder]] asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}} The new film, ''[[La Vall\u00e9e (film)|La Vall\u00e9e]]'', featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in [[New Guinea]], and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music.{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}} The group had already started working on another album, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]], France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=155}} The album was then mixed from 4\u20136 April at [[Morgan Sound Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=166}}\n\nAs they had done on ''More'', the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be cross-faded at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable without the need for any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=164}} Drummer [[Nick Mason]] recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}}\n\nDuring the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station [[Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise|ORTF]] filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with bassist [[Roger Waters]] and guitarist [[David Gilmour]].{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=166}} In a snippet of interview footage at [[Abbey Road Studios]] that appeared in the 1974 theatrical version (later released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] and subsequent \"Director's Cut\" [[DVD]]) of ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'', Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained excessive [[Sibilant consonant|sibilance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2012/11/1972-pink-floyd-obc/|title=Obscure by Clouds by Pink Floyd|publisher=Classic Rock Review|date=November 2012|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as ''Obscured by Clouds'', rather than ''La Vall\u00e9e''. In response, the film was retitled ''La Vall\u00e9e (Obscured by Clouds)'' on its release.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}}\n\n==Songs==\nThe songs on ''Obscured by Clouds'' are all short and economical, in contrast to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong [[country music]] influence was present on several tracks, with prominent use of [[acoustic guitar]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=183}} The album also featured the [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}}\n\nThe title track made prominent use of the VCS 3, and featured Mason playing electronic drums.{{sfn|Mason|2004|p=164}} The following track, \"When You're In\" is similar in style; its title came from a phrase said by roadie Chris Adamson.{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=182}} The two pieces were played back-to-back live in late 1972 and on the 1973 tours.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=114}} They were also part of the set used for the group's collaboration with [[Roland Petit]] and the [[Ballet National de Marseille]] at the Palais de Sports, Paris, in early 1973.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=173}}\n\n\"Burning Bridges\" was one of two songwriting collaborations on the album between keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] (who wrote the music) and Waters (who wrote the lyrics).{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=114}} \"[[Wot's... Uh the Deal?]]\" was a straightforward acoustic piece. It was never performed live by Pink Floyd, but Gilmour resurrected the piece for his solo tour in 2006.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=115}} One of these performances features on Gilmour's 2007 DVD ''[[Remember That Night]]''{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=303}} and also the vinyl version of his 2008 live album, ''[[Live in Gda\u0144sk]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/live-in-gdansk-mr0001696751|title=David Gilmour : Live in Gda\u0144sk (LP)|website=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Childhood's End (Pink Floyd song)|Childhood's End]]\" was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour until the release of ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'' in 1987. The title may have been derived from the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel [[Childhood's End|of the same name]]. It was performed live at a few gigs in late 1972 and early the following year; the drum pattern opening the track was recycled for \"Time\" on ''The Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=117\u20138}}\n\n\"[[Free Four]]\" was the first Pink Floyd song since \"[[See Emily Play]]\" to attract significant airplay in the US,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=165}} and the second (after \"[[Corporal Clegg]]\" from ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'')<ref name=\"Mabbett2\">{{Cite book|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=0-7119-4301-X|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of Pink Floyd|location=London|year=1995}}</ref> to deal with the death of Waters' father during World War II.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=165}}<ref>{{Allmusic |class=song |id=t1530656 |tab= |label=Song review |first=Stewart |last=Mason |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> The title is derived from the count-in \"One, two, 'free, four!\", spoken in a [[Cockney]] accent.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=118}} The track was released as a single in the US, as the band felt it was suitable for [[AM radio]].{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=184}}\n\n\"Stay\" was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. It is superficially a love song, except the protagonist cannot remember the girl's name, suggesting she might have been a [[groupie]].{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=118}} \n\n\"Absolutely Curtains\", the closing instrumental on the album, ends with a recording of the [[Mapuga]] tribe, as seen in the film.{{sfn|Povey|2006|p=155}}\n\n==Cover==\nThe album's cover was, like several other Pink Floyd albums, designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] of [[Hipgnosis]]. It consists of a photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|p=113}}{{sfn|Blake|2011|p=184}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"am\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2043589|tab=review|label=Album review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = C<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0-89919-025-1|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2773|chapter=Pink Floyd: ''Obscured by Clouds''|accessdate=26 April 2017|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00robe_1}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Neil|date=20 May 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8790376/Pink-Floyds-14-studio-albums-rated.html|title=Pink Floyd's 14 studio albums rated|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=2011 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=9780857125958 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=RA3-PA2005-IA45&dq=Tomorrow+(Hugh+Masekela+album)&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3xcKoivjhAhXuk4sKHRs4DnkQ6AEILjAB#v=snippet&q=pink%20floyd&f=false |accessdate=22 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''\n| rev5Score = 7.0/10<ref name=\"paste\">{{cite magazine|last=Deusner|first=Stephen|date=6 October 2011|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/10/pink-floyd-obscured-by-clouds-why-pink-floyd-reiss.html|title=Pink Floyd: ''Obscured by Clouds'' ('Why Pink Floyd?'

He has a crush on Sindhuja a beautiful and independent modern day girl who works in the office opposite to his. Sindhuja, eventually joins Sree's office and invites him to hangout with her at the club to which Sree happily agrees. At the club, he realises, Sindhu drinks alcohol, swears freely and is a complete party girl. He comes to know of the surprising fact that Sindhu doesn't know her own birthday because nobody except her mom knew it and her mom died when she was very young. Over time they become good friends and Sree falls head over heels in love with her.\n\nOne day the duo get stuck in an elevator and end up kissing instinctively. Sindhuja brings Sree home and they have sex after which Sree confesses his love for Sindhuja. To his shock, she rejects him saying that they are only good friends and insists that she does not love him. She refers to their sex as a casual indulgence whereupon Sree leaves her house in complete disgust. Sindhuja constantly tries to pacify him and Sree finally gives in, agreeing to continue being friends with her and begin to hang out like before. At a party, Sindhu tries to get intimate with a drunk Sree but he gets upset and shouts at her for merely using him and criticizes her character. He also reveals to everyone that he had sex with Sindhuja, making her angry. Sindhu confesses that now she also loves Sree but is disheartened by his behavior and mindset, thus ending the party on an unpleasant note.\n\nSree seeks the help of the local tailor Satish and his colleague Agathyan and attempts to reconcile with Sindhuja. He joins the dance classes conducted by Sindhu's father and eventually they patch up. As per Sindhu's wish they decide to begin a live in relationship  without the knowledge of Sree's parents since they would clearly disapprove of the idea. Sree makes a plan for his daily routine, to keep his parents oblivious of his relationship and moves into a rented house near his home with Sindhu. While Sindhu starts becoming slightly aggressive, Sree continues to steer the boat of their relationship. One night, when Sindhu is moody and irksome, Sree takes her out and reveals to her that it is her birthday and tells her that he had traced it out after a lot of difficulty. Sindhu is extremely touched and her aggressiveness comes to an end.\n\nSree constantly tries to talk Sindhu into agreeing for their marriage but she sternly refuses since she wants to achieve her dream of opening a restaurant in [[Los Angeles]]. Meanwhile, Sree's mother is hell bent on finding a good bride for him which puts Sree in a complete dilemma. Sindhu's father invites the couple for his dance show but Sree's mother falls sick and he comes in late for the show, making Sindhu upset. At the show, he pesters her about their marriage citing his mother's ill health as his imminent reason to soon marry. When Sindhu refuses to budge, he decides to break up with her for his mother's sake and to marry a girl, that his parents fix an alliance with.\n\nA day before his marriage, Sindhu turns up at his home to bid him goodbye before leaving Chennai. The two part with heavy hearts. On the day of his wedding, while Sindhu's father is driving her to the airport he confesses about how he did not acknowledge Sindhu's mother's love for him and how he regretted it after she died and asks Sindhu not to make the same mistake. Suddenly Sindhu realises she has to stop the marriage and rushes back to Sree's wedding avenue only to realize that the wedding is over and she turns to leave in tears.\n\nThree years later Sindhu has opened her dream restaurant. She eventually comes to know that Sree is getting a divorce. Sindhu's father visits Sree's parents and tells about his daughter's love for Sree, while Sree's parents lament over his failed marriage. Sree's wife had got an abortion, as revenge for an argument which Sree won. Sree's mother accepts the fact that happy live in relationships are better than unhappy marriages. Suddenly, Sree's parents and Sindhu's father realize that both of them have been missing for three days and wonder where they are. The film ends as Sree and Sindhu are seen having sex secretly as their parents call them. Their mindsets are shown to have reversed as Sree now wants a live-in relationship but Sindhu prefers marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harish Kalyan]] as Sree Kumar\n* [[Raiza Wilson]] as Sindhuja\n* [[Anand Babu]] as Sindhuja's father\n* Pandian as Sree's father\n* [[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]] as Sree's mother\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Tailor Thangaraj\n* [[Subbu Panchu]] as Manager\n* Deepz as Sathish\n* Ivaney Prem as Ivaney\n* Umadevi as Shanthi\n\n== Production ==\nIn late October 2017, musician [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]] revealed that he would produce his first feature film, which would be a co-production with Rajarajan of K Productions.

He has a crush on Sindhuja a beautiful and independent modern day girl who works in the office opposite to his. Sindhuja, eventually joins Sree's office and invites him to hangout with her at the club to which Sree happily agrees. At the club, he realises, Sindhu drinks alcohol, swears freely and is a complete party girl. He comes to know of the surprising fact that Sindhu doesn't know her own birthday because nobody except her mom knew it and her mom died when she was very young. Over time they become good friends and Sree falls head over heels in love with her.\n\nOne day the duo get stuck in an elevator and end up kissing instinctively. Sindhuja brings Sree home and they have sex after which Sree confesses his love for Sindhuja. To his shock, she rejects him saying that they are only good friends and insists that she does not love him. She refers to their sex as a casual indulgence whereupon Sree leaves her house in complete disgust. Sindhuja constantly tries to pacify him and Sree finally gives in, agreeing to continue being friends with her and begin to hang out like before. At a party, Sindhu tries to get intimate with a drunk Sree but he gets upset and shouts at her for merely using him and criticizes her character. He also reveals to everyone that he had sex with Sindhuja, making her angry. Sindhu confesses that now she also loves Sree but is disheartened by his behavior and mindset, thus ending the party on an unpleasant note.\n\nSree seeks the help of the local tailor Satish and his colleague Agathyan and attempts to reconcile with Sindhuja. He joins the dance classes conducted by Sindhu's father and eventually they patch up. As per Sindhu's wish they decide to begin a live in relationship  without the knowledge of Sree's parents since they would clearly disapprove of the idea. Sree makes a plan for his daily routine, to keep his parents oblivious of his relationship and moves into a rented house near his home with Sindhu. While Sindhu starts becoming slightly aggressive, Sree continues to steer the boat of their relationship. One night, when Sindhu is moody and irksome, Sree takes her out and reveals to her that it is her birthday and tells her that he had traced it out after a lot of difficulty. Sindhu is extremely touched and her aggressiveness comes to an end.\n\nSree constantly tries to talk Sindhu into agreeing for their marriage but she sternly refuses since she wants to achieve her dream of opening a restaurant in [[Los Angeles]]. Meanwhile, Sree's mother is hell bent on finding a good bride for him which puts Sree in a complete dilemma. Sindhu's father invites the couple for his dance show but Sree's mother falls sick and he comes in late for the show, making Sindhu upset. At the show, he pesters her about their marriage citing his mother's ill health as his imminent reason to get married soon. When Sindhu refuses to budge, he decides to break up with her for his mother's sake and get married to a girl, that his parents fix an alliance with.\n\nA day before his marriage, Sindhu turns up at his home to bid him goodbye before leaving Chennai. The two part with heavy hearts. On the day of his wedding, while Sindhu's dad is driving her to the airport he confesses about how he did not acknowledge Sindhu's mother's love for him and how he regretted it after she died and asks Sindhu not to make the same mistake. Suddenly Sindhu realises she has to stop the marriage and rushes back to Sree's wedding avenue only to realize that the wedding is over and she turns to leave in tears.\n\nThree years later Sindhu has opened her dream restaurant. She eventually comes to know that Sree is getting a divorce. Sindhu's father visits Sree's parents and tells about his daughter's love for Sree ,while Sree's parents lament over his failed marriage. Sree's wife had got an abortion, as revenge for an argument which Sree won. Sree's mother accepts the fact that happy live in relationships are better than unhappy marriages. Suddenly, Sree's parents and Sindhu's father realize that both of them have been missing for three days and wonder where they are. The film ends as Sree and Sindhu are seen having sex secretly as their parents try calling them. Their mindsets are shown to have reversed as Sree now wants a live in relationship but Sindhu wants to get married.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harish Kalyan]] as Sree Kumar\n* [[Raiza Wilson]] as Sindhuja\n* [[Anand Babu]] as Sindhuja's father\n* Pandian as Sree's father\n* [[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]] as Sree's mother\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Tailor Thangaraj\n* [[Subbu Panchu]] as Manager\n* Deepz as Sathish\n* Ivaney Prem as Ivaney\n* Umadevi as Shanthi\n\n== Production ==\nIn late October 2017, musician [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]] revealed that he would produce his first feature film, which would be a co-production with Rajarajan of K Productions.
