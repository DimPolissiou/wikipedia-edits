Directed by [[Clyde Geronimi]], [[Hamilton Luske]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it was Disney's 17th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|animated feature film]]. The film tells the story of a litter of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] puppies who are kidnapped by the villainous [[Cruella de Vil]] (\"deVille\"),<ref>Disney-produced 1961 advertising used the \"deVille\" spelling.\"101 Dalmatians\" (Orpheum Theater advertisement).

Current word count is 634 words. -->\nRoger Radcliffe is a songwriter who lives in a bachelor flat in [[London]], with his pet [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]], Pongo, who decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself, because he is bored with bachelor life. While watching various women with their female dog look-alikes out the window, he spots the perfect pair, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita eventually fall in love and marry with their dogs.\n\nLater, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the \"Twilight bark\", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.\n\nAn [[Old English Sheepdog]] named Colonel, along with his compatriots, a gray horse named Captain, and a tabby cat named Sergeant Tibbs, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place in [[Suffolk]]), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin [[fur coat]]s, the Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has arrived, and they must cross the [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour River]] which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.\n\nAfter a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In the town of Dinsford, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]s, then pile inside a [[moving van]] bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles crash into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last as the van drives away.\n\nBack in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella. They miss their canine companions, but they hear barking outside and the house is filled with dogs after their nanny opens the door. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to keep all the puppies and use the money from Roger's song to buy a larger house in the country so they can have a Dalmatian plantation.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Pongo, Roger's pet, Perdita's mate, and the father of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Cate Bauer]] as Perdita, Anita's Dalmatian pet, Pongo's mate, and the mother of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a cruel and eccentric heiress who has Pongo and Perdita's puppies kidnapped with the intention of making fur coats out of them. She has an obsession for pelts, but is only shown wearing a single, voluminous white coat. Beneath this, she wears a skintight black dress. Cruella smokes constantly and drives a long red and black car based on a 1934\u201336 [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] Cabriolet. She was also Anita's former schoolmate, which is why Anita assumes [[good-faith]] that Cruella is well-meaning despite her eccentric behavior. Roger, however, is far less trusting, and suspects her of being the one to kidnap the puppies (which she did). Gerson also voiced Mrs. Birdwell, a contestant on the show \"What's My Crime?\". [[Mary Wickes]] served as Cruella's live-action model.\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's \"pet\" (owner) and Anita's husband. He works as a songwriter and later becomes rich when creating a song about Cruella de Vil. [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] provided Roger's singing voice.\n* [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's owner and Roger's wife. [[Helene Stanley]] served as Anita's live-action model.\n* [[Martha Wentworth]] as Nanny, The Radcliffes' maid. She is very maternal and fussy, detests Cruella, has no patience for teasing, and is very attached to the puppies, but worthless in a crisis except to give the alarm. Wentworth also voiced Queenie, one of three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold, and Lucy, a goose who helps send the word along about the puppies, along with Towser.\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] and [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Horace and Jasper, respectively, Cruella's [[comic relief]] henchmen who carry out the kidnapping of the Dalmatian puppies. Jasper is tall and thin, while Horace is short and fat; otherwise, they are obviously fraternal twin brothers. They argue often. Although they appear to be stupid, Horace appears to be the more intelligent of the two, but is absolutely intimidated by his brother, who has the more ready tongue. Jasper has a closed mind to the possibility of sapience in dogs \u2014 as well as the equal possibility of cleverness in his brother. Jasper drinks alcohol, whereas Horace eats sandwiches. Both enjoy watching a weekly television program called \"What's My Crime?\", wherein the misdeeds of lawbreakers are guessed by a panel of contestants. One of the guest stars of this program, Percival \"Meathead\" Fauncewater, is an acquaintance of theirs. O'Malley also voiced The Colonel, an old [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] who aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies. Worlock also voiced Inspector Craven, a contestant on \"What's My Crime?\"\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as The Captain, a [[horse]] who also aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies.\n* [[David Frankham]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a [[tabby cat]] who is the most prominent in masterminding a rescue mission to save the puppies from Cruella.\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Lucky, a [[runt]]y puppy of Pongo and Perdita who nearly dies after being born. He is given the name \"Lucky\" because of being revived by Roger. He loves watching TV, and is portrayed as a troublemaker.\n* [[Barbara Beaird]] as Rolly, a puppy who is always hungry, and is shown as pudgier than the rest of the puppies. His collar is tight around his neck with his fat bunched up around it.\n* Mickey Maga as Patch, a puppy who loves Thunderbolt and has a spot on his eye. Patch is aggressive, barking and growling, but is often frightened by Cruella de Vil. He is the star of the animated sequel, ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''.\n* Sandra Abbott as Penny, the only puppy not named for her appearance or habits.\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Freckles, a puppy who has a pattern of spots over the bridge of her nose resembling freckles on a human child. Freckles is shown very tired, or asking many questions.\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Towser, a [[bloodhound]] who helps spread the news about the stolen puppies, along with Lucy.\n* [[George Pelling]] as Danny, a [[Great Dane]] who aids Pongo and Perdita and is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Scottie.\n* [[Queenie Leonard]] as Princess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Duchess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Rover, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Rickie Sorensen]] as Spotty, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Collie, who offers the Dalmatians shelter for the night at a [[dairy farm]]. Conway also voiced the Quizmaster, the host of \"What's My Crime?\"\n* Ramsay Hill as the [[Labrador Retriever]] who aids the Dalmatians in making it back to London.\n* [[Paul Wexler (actor)|Paul Wexler]] as Car Mechanic\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Truck Driver\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Dirty Dawson, the villain of ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'', the show that the Dalmatians watch.\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as TV Commercial Singer, who sings the \"Kanine Krunchies\" jingle.\n* [[Junius Matthews]] as Scottie, Danny's terrier friend who is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Danny.\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nDodie Smith wrote the book ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' in 1956.

Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film. The first song, \"Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor\", a [[cockney]] chant, was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion. A second song, \"Cheerio, Good-Bye, Toodle-oo, Hip Hip!\" was to be sung by the dalmatian puppies as they make their way into London.<ref name=\"Koenig\" /> A third song titled \"March of the One Hundred and One\" was meant for the dogs to sing after escaping Cruella by van.

Unlike the original film, none of the animals had speaking voices in this version. Its success in theaters led to ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', released on November 22, 2000.\n\n====TV series====\nAfter the first live-action version of the film, an animated series titled ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' was launched. The designs of the characters were stylized further to allow for economic animation and to appeal to contemporary trends.\n\n''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'' is the second TV series with a plot in the 21st century, with a new art style, and a concept loosely based in the source material. It centres on Dylan, a descendant of Pongo and Perdita, caring for his 97 younger siblings with the help of his stepsister Dolly.\n\n====Sequel====\n''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London

Directed by [[Clyde Geronimi]], [[Hamilton Luske]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it was Disney's 17th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|animated feature film]]. The film tells the story of a litter of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] puppies who are kidnapped by the villainous [[Cruella de Vil]] (\"deVille\"),<ref>Disney-produced 1961 advertising used the \"deVille\" spelling.\"101 Dalmatians\" (Orpheum Theater advertisement).

Current word count is 634 words. -->\nRoger Radcliffe is a songwriter who lives in a bachelor flat in [[London]], with his pet [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]], Pongo, who decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself, because he is bored with bachelor life. While watching various women with their female dog look-alikes out the window, he spots the perfect pair, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita eventually fall in love and marry with their dogs.\n\nLater, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the \"Twilight bark\", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.\n\nAn [[Old English Sheepdog]] named Colonel, along with his compatriots, a gray horse named Captain, and a tabby cat named Sergeant Tibbs, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place in [[Suffolk]]), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin [[fur coat]]s, the Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has arrived, and they must cross the [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour River]] which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.\n\nAfter a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In the town of Dinsford, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]s, then pile inside a [[moving van]] bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles crash into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last as the van drives away.\n\nBack in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella. They miss their canine companions, but they hear barking outside and the house is filled with dogs after their nanny opens the door. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to keep all the puppies and use the money from Roger's song to buy a larger house in the country so they can have a Dalmatian plantation.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Pongo, Roger's pet, Perdita's mate, and the father of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Cate Bauer]] as Perdita, Anita's Dalmatian pet, Pongo's mate, and the mother of 15 of the 99 puppies.\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as [[Cruella de Vil|Cruella De Vil]], a cruel and eccentric heiress who has Pongo and Perdita's puppies kidnapped with the intention of making fur coats out of them. She has an obsession for pelts, but is only shown wearing a single, voluminous white coat. Beneath this, she wears a skintight black dress. Cruella smokes constantly and drives a long red and black car based on a 1934\u201336 [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] Cabriolet. She was also Anita's former schoolmate, which is why Anita assumes [[good-faith]] that Cruella is well-meaning despite her eccentric behavior. Roger, however, is far less trusting, and suspects her of being the one to kidnap the puppies (which she did). Gerson also voiced Mrs. Birdwell, a contestant on the show \"What's My Crime?\". [[Mary Wickes]] served as Cruella's live-action model.\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's \"pet\" (owner) and Anita's husband. He works as a songwriter and later becomes rich when creating a song about Cruella de Vil. [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] provided Roger's singing voice.\n* [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's owner and Roger's wife. [[Helene Stanley]] served as Anita's live-action model.\n* [[Martha Wentworth]] as Nanny, The Radcliffes' maid. She is very maternal and fussy, detests Cruella, has no patience for teasing, and is very attached to the puppies, but worthless in a crisis except to give the alarm. Wentworth also voiced Queenie, one of three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold, and Lucy, a goose who helps send the word along about the puppies, along with Towser.\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] and [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Horace and Jasper, respectively, Cruella's [[comic relief]] henchmen who carry out the kidnapping of the Dalmatian puppies. Jasper is tall and thin, while Horace is short and fat; otherwise, they are obviously fraternal twin brothers. They argue often. Although they appear to be stupid, Horace appears to be the more intelligent of the two, but is absolutely intimidated by his brother, who has the more ready tongue. Jasper has a closed mind to the possibility of sapience in dogs \u2014 as well as the equal possibility of cleverness in his brother. Jasper drinks alcohol, whereas Horace eats sandwiches. Both enjoy watching a weekly television program called \"What's My Crime?\", wherein the misdeeds of lawbreakers are guessed by a panel of contestants. One of the guest stars of this program, Percival \"Meathead\" Fauncewater, is an acquaintance of theirs. O'Malley also voiced The Colonel, an old [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] who aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies. Worlock also voiced Inspector Craven, a contestant on \"What's My Crime?\"\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as The Captain, a [[horse]] who also aids Pongo and Perdita in finding the puppies.\n* [[David Frankham]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a [[tabby cat]] who is the most prominent in masterminding a rescue mission to save the puppies from Cruella.\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Lucky, a [[runt]]y puppy of Pongo and Perdita who nearly dies after being born. He is given the name \"Lucky\" because of being revived by Roger. He loves watching TV, and is portrayed as a troublemaker.\n* [[Barbara Beaird]] as Rolly, a puppy who is always hungry, and is shown as pudgier than the rest of the puppies. His collar is tight around his neck with his fat bunched up around it.\n* Mickey Maga as Patch, a puppy who loves Thunderbolt and has a spot on his eye. Patch is aggressive, barking and growling, but is often frightened by Cruella de Vil. He is the star of the animated sequel, ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''.\n* Sandra Abbott as Penny, the only puppy not named for her appearance or habits.\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Freckles, a puppy who has a pattern of spots over the bridge of her nose resembling freckles on a human child. Freckles is shown very tired, or asking many questions.\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Towser, a [[bloodhound]] who helps spread the news about the stolen puppies, along with Lucy.\n* [[George Pelling]] as Danny, a [[Great Dane]] who aids Pongo and Perdita and is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with Scottie.\n* [[Queenie Leonard]] as Princess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Duchess, one of the three cows who help the puppies when seeking shelter from the cold.\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Rover, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Rickie Sorensen]] as Spotty, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella kidnapped.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Collie, who offers the Dalmatians shelter for the night at a [[dairy farm]].

Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film. The first song, \"Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor\", a [[cockney]] chant, was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion. A second song, \"Cheerio, Good-Bye, Toodle-oo, Hip Hip!\" was to be sung by the dalmatian puppies as they make their way into London.<ref name=\"Koenig\" /> A third song titled \"March of the One Hundred and One\" was meant for the dogs to sing after escaping Cruella by van.

The earliest of these endeavors was the 1996 live-action remake, ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'', which starred [[Glenn Close]] as Cruella De Vil. Unlike the original film, none of the animals had speaking voices in this version. Its success in theaters led to ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', released on November 22, 2000.\n\n====TV series====\nAfter the first live-action version of the film, an animated series titled ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' was launched. The designs of the characters were stylized further to allow for economic animation and to appeal to contemporary trends.\n\n''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'' is the second TV series with a plot in the 21st century, with a new art style, and a concept loosely based in the source material. It centres on Dylan, a descendant of Pongo and Perdita, caring for his 97 younger siblings with the help of his stepsister Dolly.\n\n====Sequel====\n''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London

The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was advancing with a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army of 6,000 from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to [[York]], when he met a small force of around 580 [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in [[Piercebridge]]. The Parliamentarians, commanded by [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], were defending the bridge over the [[River Tees]]. After three hours heavy fighting, Hotham and his men retreated, allowing the Royalists a clear path to continue onto York.\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced towards Yorkshire with around 6,000 men; composed of 4,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and dragoons, and ten artillery pieces. He had to cross the [[River Tees]], on the border between [[County Durham]] and [[Yorkshire]], at [[Piercebridge]]. To defend against his advance, the Parliamentarians placed a small force of around 580 men\u2014400 infantry and 180 cavalry\u2014on the southern side of the bridge, under the command of [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]].{{sfn|Daniels|Philo|2018|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n==Battle==\nOn 1 December,{{sfn|Daniels|Philo|2018|pp=14\u201316}} Newcastle sent a [[vanguard]] into Piercebridge under the command of Colonel Sir Thomas Howard. He placed the ten artillery pieces on Carlbury Hill, to the east of the village. Howard's dragoons led the assault, followed by infantry commanded by Sir William Lambton. After a few hours of intense fighting, during which Colonel Howard was killed, the Royalists forced Hotham to retreat.

The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was advancing with a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army of 6,000 from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to [[York]], when he met a small force of around 580 [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in [[Piercebridge]]. The Parliamentarians, commanded by [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], were defending the bridge over the [[River Tees]]. After three hours heavy fighting, Hotham and his men retreated, allowing the Royalists a clear path to continue onto York.\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced towards Yorkshire with around 6,000 men; composed of 4,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and dragoons, and ten artillery pieces. He had to cross the [[River Tees]], on the border between [[County Durham]] and [[Yorkshire]], at [[Piercebridge]]. To defend against his advance, the Parliamentarians placed a small force of around 580 men\u2014400 infantry and 180 cavalry\u2014on the southern side of the bridge, under the command of [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]].{{sfn|Daniels|Philo|2018|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n==Battle==\nOn 1 December,{{sfn|Daniels|Philo|2018|pp=14\u201316}} Newcastle sent a [[vanguard]] into Piercebridge under the command of Colonel Sir Thomas Howard. He placed the ten artillery pieces on Carlbury Hill, to the east of the village. Howard's dragoons led the assault, followed by infantry commanded by Sir William Lambton. After a few hours of intense fighting, during which Colonel Howard was killed, the Royalists forced Hotham to retreat. According to Parliamentarian accounts, they suffered no losses and only minimal casualties.{{sfn|Daniels|Philo|2018|pp=14\u201316}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Parliamentarians retreated south through Yorkshire towards [[Knaresborough]].
