Like the previous season, they lost only three league games all season. Unlike in 1998\u201399 season, they won by a comfortable margin \u2013 18 points as opposed to a single point.\n\nTheir only disappointment of the season came when they lost their defence of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] following a 3\u20132 defeat against [[Real Madrid]] in the quarter finals. Manchester United had withdrawn from the 1999\u20132000 [[FA Cup]] to participate in the [[FIFA Club World Championship|FIFA World Club Championship]] at the request of the FA who wanted Manchester United to compete to support England's bid to host the World Cup. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] would go on to win the last\nFA Cup held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before its redevelopment. The [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final was won by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], for the second time in four seasons. In Europe, [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] reached the [[UEFA Cup]] semi final and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were on the losing side to Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup final.\n\nOnly one newly promoted team suffered relegation: [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], who finished in last place, and achieved a record Premiership low of just 24 points (a record since broken by Sunderland (twice) and by Derby County, Aston Villa and Huddersfield Town), despite a decent start to their campaign which saw them beat both Liverpool (at Anfield) and Chelsea. The most successful promoted team was [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who finished seventh in the final table and spent much of the season pushing for a place in European competition. [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], back in the top division for the first time since 1922, secured their Premiership survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20130 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. The result meant that Liverpool lost out on a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] place, and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were relegated after 14 years of top-division football. Second-from-bottom [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] were relegated in their penultimate game of the season, having spent 15 of the previous 16 seasons in the top division. Wednesday's season included an 8\u20130 defeat at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]]. Amazingly [[Coventry City]] went all season without an away win but still managed to secure 14th place due to an impressive home record which saw them win 12 out of their 19 matches.\n\nAs well as Premiership champions Manchester United and runners-up Arsenal, third placed Leeds United qualified for the 2000\u201301 Champions League. UEFA Cup places went to fourth placed Liverpool, F.A Cup winners Chelsea, and League Cup winners Leicester City.\n\nPromoted to the Premiership for 2000\u201301 were [[Football League First Division|First Division]] champions [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], runners-up Manchester City and playoff winners [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. For the first time since the formation of the Premiership, all of the promoted teams had been members of the Premiership before.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1998\u201399 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], returning after absences of two, seventy-seven and eleven years respectively. This was also both Bradford City and Watford's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Charlton Athletic and Nottingham Forest were immediately relegated after a season's presence while Blackburn Rovers' seven year top flight spell came to an end.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1999\u20132000 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.804222 |long=-1.759022 |label_size=80|label=[[Bradford City A.F.C.|{{nowrap|Bradford City}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.578219 |long=-1.216822 |label_size=80|label=[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.370342 |long=-1.470853 |label_size=80|label=[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|{{nowrap|Sheffield Wednesday}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.914400 |long=-1.388200 |label_size=80|label=[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.649906 |long=-0.401531 |label_size=80|label=[[Watford F.C.|Watford]]|position=left}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]<br/>\n[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.398333 |long=-0.085556|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=bottom}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Like the previous season, they lost only three league games all season. Unlike in 1998\u201399 season, they won by a comfortable margin \u2013 18 points as opposed to a single point.\n\nTheir only disappointment of the season came when they lost their defence of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] following a 3\u20132 defeat against [[Real Madrid]] in the quarter finals. Manchester United had withdrawn from the 1999\u20132000 [[FA Cup]] to participate in the [[FIFA Club World Championship|FIFA World Club Championship]] at the request of the FA who wanted Manchester United to compete to support England's bid to host the World Cup. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] would go on to win the last\nFA Cup held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before its redevelopment. The [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final was won by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], for the second time in four seasons. In Europe, [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] reached the [[UEFA Cup]] semi final and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were on the losing side to Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup final.\n\nOnly one newly promoted team suffered relegation: [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], who finished in last place, and achieved a record Premiership low of just 24 points (a record since broken by Sunderland (twice) and by Derby County, Aston Villa and Huddersfield Town), despite a decent start to their campaign which saw them beat both Liverpool (at Anfield) and Chelsea. The most successful promoted team was [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who finished seventh in the final table and spent much of the season pushing for a place in European competition. [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], back in the top division for the first time since 1922, secured their Premiership survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20130 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. The result meant that Liverpool lost out on a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] place, and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were relegated after 14 years of top-division football. Second-from-bottom [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] were relegated in their penultimate game of the season, having spent 15 of the previous 16 seasons in the top division. Wednesday's season included an 8\u20130 defeat at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]]. Amazingly [[Coventry City]] went all season without an away win but still managed to secure 14th place due to an impressive home record which saw them win 12 out of their 19 matches.\n\nAs well as Premiership champions Manchester United and runners-up Arsenal, third placed Leeds United qualified for the 2000\u201301 Champions League. UEFA Cup places went to fourth placed Liverpool, F.A Cup winners Chelsea, and League Cup winners Leicester City.\n\nPromoted to the Premiership for 2000\u201301 were [[Football League First Division|First Division]] champions [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], runners-up Manchester City and playoff winners [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. For the first time since the formation of the Premiership, all of the promoted teams had been members of the Premiership before.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1998\u201399 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], returning after absences of two, seventy-seven and eleven years respectively.
