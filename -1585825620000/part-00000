Though this speed is most commonly associated with [[light]], it is also the speed at which all [[massless particle]]s and [[field (physics)|field]] perturbations travel in vacuum, including [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[gravitational wave]]s. Such particles and waves travel at {{math|''c''}} regardless of the motion of the source or the [[inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] of the observer. Particles with nonzero [[rest mass]] can approach {{mvar|c}}, but can never actually reach it. In the [[theory of relativity|special and general theories of relativity]], {{math|''c''}} interrelates [[spacetime|space and time]], and also appears in the famous equation of [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref name=LeClerq>{{Cite book| last=Uzan |first=J-P |last2=Leclercq |first2=B | year=2008 | title=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSAWX8TNpScC&pg=PA43 | pages=43\u201344 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-73454-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe speed at which light propagates through [[Transparency and translucency|transparent materials]], such as glass or air, is less than {{math|''c''}}; similarly, the speed of [[electromagnetic waves]] in wire cables is slower than {{math|''c''}}. The ratio between {{math|''c''}} and the speed {{math|''v''}} at which light travels in a material is called the [[refractive index]] {{math|''n''}} of the material ({{math|1=''n'' = ''c'' / ''v''}}). For example, for [[visible light]] the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at {{nowrap|{{math|''c''}} / 1.5 \u2248 {{cvt|200000|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=3}}}}; the [[refractive index of air]] for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about {{cvt|{{#expr:299792.458/1.0003 round -1}}|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=5}}, which is about {{cvt|90|km/s|mi/s|sigfig=2}} slower than {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFor many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant [[space probes]], it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the data transfer between the CPU and memory chips in [[computer]]s. The speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision.\n\n[[Ole R\u00f8mer]] first [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|demonstrated in 1676]] that light travels at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. In 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed {{math|''c''}} appearing in his theory of electromagnetism.<ref>{{cite web |title=How is the speed of light measured? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html |url-status=dead |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ |first=Philip |last=Gibbs |date=1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html |archivedate=2015-08-21 |df= }}</ref> In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} with respect to any inertial frame is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source.<ref name=\"stachel\">{{cite book |title=Einstein from \"B\" to \"Z\" \u2013 Volume 9 of Einstein studies |first1=JJ |last1=Stachel |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8176-4143-6 |page=226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA226}}</ref> He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity and in doing so showed that the parameter {{math|''c''}} had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.\n\nAfter centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be {{cvt|299792458|m/s|ft/s mi/s|sigfig=9|comma=gaps}} with a [[measurement uncertainty]] of 4{{nbsp}}parts per billion. In 1983, the [[metre]] was redefined in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in 1/{{val|299792458}} of a [[second]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Numerical value, notation, and units==\nThe speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase {{math|''c''}}, for \"constant\" or the Latin {{lang|la|[[:wikt:celeritas|celeritas]]}} (meaning \"swiftness, celerity\"). In 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] had used {{math|''c''}} for a different constant later shown to equal {{radic|2}} times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol ''V'' was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1865. In 1894, [[Paul Drude]] redefined {{math|''c''}} with its modern meaning. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used ''V'' in his [[Annus Mirabilis papers|original German-language papers]] on special relativity in 1905<!--, the 1923 English translation of them by Perrett and Jeffery using {{math|''c''}}-->, but in 1907 he switched to {{math|''c''}}, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.<ref name=Yc>\n{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=2004\n |origyear=1997\n |title=Why is ''c'' the symbol for the speed of light?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]\n |accessdate=2009-11-16\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325220247/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/c.html\n |archivedate=2010-03-25\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}\n\"The origins of the letter c being used for the speed of light can be traced back to a paper of 1856 by Weber and Kohlrausch [...] Weber apparently meant c to stand for 'constant' in his force law, but there is evidence that physicists such as Lorentz and Einstein were accustomed to a common convention that c could be used as a variable for velocity.

The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a [[plane wave]] (a wave filling the whole space, with only one [[frequency]]) propagate is called the [[phase velocity]]&nbsp;''v''<sub>p</sub>. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed.

It is often represented in terms of a ''refractive index''. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of ''c'' to the phase velocity&nbsp;''v''<sub>p</sub> in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant.

This slowing applies to any medium such as air, water, or glass, and is responsible for phenomena such as [[refraction]]. When light leaves the medium and returns to a vacuum, and ignoring any effects of [[gravity]], its speed returns to the usual speed of light in a vacuum,  ''c''.\n\nCommon explanations for this slowing, based upon the idea of light scattering from, or being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms, are both incorrect.<ref name=Fermilab/> Explanations like these would cause a \"blurring\" effect in the resulting light, as it would no longer be travelling in just one direction. But this effect is not seen in nature.\n\nA more correct explanation rests on light's nature as an [[electromagnetic wave]].<ref name=Fermilab>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8 Why does light slow down in water?] - [[Fermilab]]</ref> Because light is an oscillating electrical/magnetic wave, light traveling in a medium causes the electrically charged [[electron]]s of the material to also oscillate. (The material's [[proton]]s also oscillate but as they are around 2000 times more massive, their movement and therefore their effect, is far smaller). A moving [[electrical charge]] emits electromagnetic waves of its own. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the oscillating electrons, interact with the electromagnetic waves that make up the original light, similar to water waves on a pond, a process known as [[constructive interference]]. When two waves interfere in this way, the resulting \"combined\" wave may have wave packets that pass an observer at a slower rate. The light has effectively been slowed down. When the light leaves the material, this interaction with electrons no longer happens, and therefore the wave packet rate (and therefore its speed) return to normal.\n\n==Practical effects of finiteness==\nThe speed of light is of relevance to [[telecommunication|communications]]: the one-way and  [[round-trip delay time]] are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\n===Small scales===\nIn [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processors]]. If a processor operates at 1{{nbsp}}[[gigahertz]], a signal can travel only a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name=\"processorlimit\">{{Cite book\n |last=Parhami |first=B\n |year=1999\n |title=Introduction to parallel processing: algorithms and architectures\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ekBsZkIYfUgC&printsec=frontcover&q=\n |page=5\n |publisher=[[Plenum Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-306-45970-2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"processorlimit2\">{{cite conference\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sona_r6dPyQC&lpg=PA26&dq=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&f=false\n |title=Software Transactional Memories: An Approach for Multicore Programming\n|first1=D |last1=Imbs\n|first2=Michel |last2=Raynal\n|year=2009\n|conference=10th International Conference, PaCT 2009, Novosibirsk, Russia, 31 August \u2013 4 September 2009\n|editor=Malyshkin, V\n|publisher=Springer\n|isbn=978-3-642-03274-5\n|page=26\n}}</ref>\n\n===Large distances on Earth===\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about {{val|40075|u=km}} and that ''c'' is about {{val|300000|u=km/s}}, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds.

There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase.

As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.\n\nNASA must wait several hours for information from a probe orbiting Jupiter, and if it needs to correct a navigation error, the fix will not arrive at the spacecraft for an equal amount of time, creating a risk of the correction not arriving in time.\n\nReceiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer.

Please do not change the title of the section without amending the articles which link to it. --->\nThere are different ways to determine the value of ''c''. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine ''c'' from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants [[relative permittivity|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling ''c''.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a second\",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second|described below]]. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of ''c''.\n\n===Astronomical measurements===\n[[File:Io eclipse speed of light measurement.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Measurement of the speed of light using the eclipse of Io by Jupiter]]\n[[Outer space]] is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect [[vacuum]]. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) per day.\n\n[[Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]] used an astronomical measurement to make [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light]].<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal\n |last=Cohen |first=IB\n |year=1940\n |title=Roemer and the first determination of the velocity of light (1676)\n |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]\n |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=327\u201379\n |doi=10.1086/347594\n |ref=cohen-1940\n|hdl=2027/uc1.b4375710\n |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=uc1.b4375710;orient=0;size=100;seq=5;attachment=0\n }}</ref><ref name=roemer>\n{{cite journal\n |year=1676\n |title=Demonstration tovchant le mouvement de la lumiere trouv\u00e9 par M.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. R\u00f8mer observed this effect for [[Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\n\n[[File:SoL Aberration.svg|thumb|right|upright|Aberration of light: light from a distant source appears to be from a different location for a moving telescope due to the finite speed of light.|alt=A star emits a light ray which hits the objective of a telescope.

This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]].\n\nThe setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=1997\n |title=How is the speed of light measured?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=University of California, Riverside\n |accessdate=2010-01-13\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |archivedate=2015-08-21\n |df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal.

Such particles and waves travel at {{math|''c''}} regardless of the motion of the source or the [[inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] of the observer. Particles with nonzero [[rest mass]] can approach {{mvar|c}}, but can never actually reach it.

The ratio between {{math|''c''}} and the speed {{math|''v''}} at which light travels in a material is called the [[refractive index]] {{math|''n''}} of the material ({{math|1=''n'' = ''c'' / ''v''}}). For example, for [[visible light]] the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at {{nowrap|{{math|''c''}} / 1.5 \u2248 {{cvt|200000|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=3}}}}; the [[refractive index of air]] for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about {{cvt|{{#expr:299792.458/1.0003 round -1}}|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=5}}, which is about {{cvt|90|km/s|mi/s|sigfig=2}} slower than {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFor many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant [[space probes]], it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the data transfer between the CPU and memory chips in [[computer]]s. The speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision.\n\n[[Ole R\u00f8mer]] first [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|demonstrated in 1676]] that light travels at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

This slowing applies to any medium such as air, water, or glass, and is responsible for phenomena such as [[refraction]]. When light leaves the medium and returns to a vacuum, and ignoring any effects of [[gravity]], its speed returns to the usual speed of light in a vacuum,  ''c''.\n\nCommon explanations for this slowing, based upon the idea of light scattering from, or being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms, are both incorrect.<ref name=Fermilab/> Explanations like these would cause a \"blurring\" effect in the resulting light, as it would no longer be travelling in just one direction. But this effect is not seen in nature.\n\nA more correct explanation rests on light's nature as an [[electromagnetic wave]].<ref name=Fermilab>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8 Why does light slow down in water?] - [[Fermilab]]</ref> Because light is an oscillating electrical/magnetic wave, light traveling in a medium causes the electrically charged [[electron]]s of the material to also oscillate. (The material's [[proton]]s also oscillate but as they are around 2000 times more massive, their movement and therefore their effect, is far smaller). A moving [[electrical charge]] emits electromagnetic waves of its own. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the oscillating electrons, interact with the electromagnetic waves that make up the original light, similar to water waves on a pond, a process known as [[constructive interference]]. When two waves interfere in this way, the resulting \"combined\" wave may have wave packets that pass an observer at a slower rate. The light has effectively been slowed down. When the light leaves the material, this interaction with electrons no longer happens, and therefore the wave packet rate (and therefore its speed) return to normal.\n\n==Practical effects of finiteness==\nThe speed of light is of relevance to [[telecommunication|communications]]: the one-way and  [[round-trip delay time]] are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\n===Small scales===\nIn [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processors]]. If a processor operates at 1{{nbsp}}[[gigahertz]], a signal can travel only a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name=\"processorlimit\">{{Cite book\n |last=Parhami |first=B\n |year=1999\n |title=Introduction to parallel processing: algorithms and architectures\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ekBsZkIYfUgC&printsec=frontcover&q=\n |page=5\n |publisher=[[Plenum Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-306-45970-2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"processorlimit2\">{{cite conference\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sona_r6dPyQC&lpg=PA26&dq=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&f=false\n |title=Software Transactional Memories: An Approach for Multicore Programming\n|first1=D |last1=Imbs\n|first2=Michel |last2=Raynal\n|year=2009\n|conference=10th International Conference, PaCT 2009, Novosibirsk, Russia, 31 August \u2013 4 September 2009\n|editor=Malyshkin, V\n|publisher=Springer\n|isbn=978-3-642-03274-5\n|page=26\n}}</ref>\n\n===Large distances on Earth===\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about {{val|40075|u=km}} and that ''c'' is about {{val|300000|u=km/s}}, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds.

There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase.

As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.\n\nNASA must wait several hours for information from a probe orbiting Jupiter, and if it needs to correct a navigation error, the fix will not arrive at the spacecraft for an equal amount of time, creating a risk of the correction not arriving in time.\n\nReceiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer.

Please do not change the title of the section without amending the articles which link to it. --->\nThere are different ways to determine the value of ''c''. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine ''c'' from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants [[relative permittivity|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling ''c''.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a second\",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second|described below]]. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of ''c''.\n\n===Astronomical measurements===\n[[File:Io eclipse speed of light measurement.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Measurement of the speed of light using the eclipse of Io by Jupiter]]\n[[Outer space]] is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect [[vacuum]]. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) per day.\n\n[[Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]] used an astronomical measurement to make [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light]].<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal\n |last=Cohen |first=IB\n |year=1940\n |title=Roemer and the first determination of the velocity of light (1676)\n |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]\n |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=327\u201379\n |doi=10.1086/347594\n |ref=cohen-1940\n|hdl=2027/uc1.b4375710\n |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=uc1.b4375710;orient=0;size=100;seq=5;attachment=0\n }}</ref><ref name=roemer>\n{{cite journal\n |year=1676\n |title=Demonstration tovchant le mouvement de la lumiere trouv\u00e9 par M.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. R\u00f8mer observed this effect for [[Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\n\n[[File:SoL Aberration.svg|thumb|right|upright|Aberration of light: light from a distant source appears to be from a different location for a moving telescope due to the finite speed of light.|alt=A star emits a light ray which hits the objective of a telescope.

This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]].\n\nThe setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=1997\n |title=How is the speed of light measured?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=University of California, Riverside\n |accessdate=2010-01-13\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |archivedate=2015-08-21\n |df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal.

A Bengali short film Birendra Krishna Bhadra - The Voice Since 1936 Was released In 2019 By Haalum Digital Media Entertainment Pvt. Ltd.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBirendra Krishna Bhadra was born on 4 August 1905, to Roy Bahadur Kalikrishna and Sarala Bala Devi at a rented house in Ahiritola his maternal home, in the north [[Kolkata]]. Later the family shifted to 7, Ramdhan Mitra Lane, the house bought by his grandmother Yogo Maya Devi. His father, Kali Krishna Bhadra was a linguist, fluent in 14 languages, and employed as an interpreter in a lower court and later became a known figure in the Bengali literary circles of the time. Kali Krishna married Sarala Bala Devi the second child of the then famous Police Court lawyer Kalicharan Ghosh, and in 1927 was awarded the title of [[Rai Bahadur|Roy Bahadur]]. Roy Bahadur Kali Krishna had two sons, Bhupendra Krishna and Birendra Krishna. In 1926, Birendra Krishna Bhadra passed Intermediate, and in 1928 graduated from [[Scottish Church College]], Kolkata.\n\n==Career==\nHe adapted and restructured several classics to produce notable radio plays. In the 1930s [[All India Radio]], Kolkata started broadcasting a two-hour program called [[Mahishashura Mardini]] which describes the epic battle of goddess [[Durga]] with the demon king [[Mahishashura]]. The script of this program was written by Bani Kumar and the music was directed by [[Pankaj Mullick|Pankaj Kumar Mallik]].\n\nBhadra wrote some plays including ''Mess No. 49'', and directed a theatre production ''Sahib Bibi Gulam'', a stage adaptation of the celebrated novel of famous author, the [[Bimal Mitra]]. In 1952, he dramatised [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]'s novel ''Subarna Golak'' which was filmed in the [[Subarna Golak|same name]] in 1981.\n\n==Legacy==\nHis rendition, Mahisasura Mardini, is still played by [[All India Radio]], every [[Mahalaya]], marking the beginning of [[Durga Puja]] festivities.

From this it appeared that the fixed residents, more than one half of whom are Mohammedans, are about eight thousand; but the continual arrival and departure of strangers, make the total number of those present in the city from ten to fifteen thousand generally, according to the season of the year. The proportion which the numbers of those of different sects bear to each other in this estimate, was not so easily ascertained. The answers which I received to enquiries on this point, were framed differently by the professors of every different faith. Each of these seemed anxious to magnify the number of those who believed his own dogmas, and to diminish that of the professors of other creeds. Their accounts were therefore so discordant, that no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of any of them. The Mohammedans are certainly the most numerous, and these consist of nearly equal portions of Osmanli Turks, from Asia Minor; descendents of pure Turks by blood, but Arabians by birth; a mixture of Turkish and Arab blood, by intermarriages; and pure Syrian Arabs, of an unmixed race. Of Europeans, there are only the few monks of the Catholic convent, and the still fewer Latin pilgrims who occasionally visit them. The Greeks are the most numerous of ail the Christians, and these are chiefly the clergy and devotees. The Armenians follow next in order, as to numbers, but their body is thought to exceed that of the Greeks in influence and in wealth. The inferior sects of Copts, Abyssinians, Syrians, Nestorians, Maronites, Chaldeans, &c. are scarcely perceptible in the crowd.

From this it appeared that the fixed residents, more than one half of whom are Mohammedans, are about eight thousand; but the continual arrival and departure of strangers, make the total number of those present in the city from ten to fifteen thousand generally, according to the season of the year. The proportion which the numbers of those of different sects bear to each other in this estimate, was not so easily ascertained. The answers which I received to enquiries on this point, were framed differently by the professors of every different faith. Each of these seemed anxious to magnify the number of those who believed his own dogmas, and to diminish that of the professors of other creeds. Their accounts were therefore so discordant, that no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of any of them. The Mohammedans are certainly the most numerous, and these consist of nearly equal portions of Osmanli Turks, from Asia Minor; descendents of pure Turks by blood, but Arabians by birth; a mixture of Turkish and Arab blood, by intermarriages; and pure Syrian Arabs, of an unmixed race. Of Europeans, there are only the few monks of the Catholic convent, and the still fewer Latin pilgrims who occasionally visit them. The Greeks are the most numerous of ail the Christians, and these are chiefly the clergy and devotees. The Armenians follow next in order, as to numbers, but their body is thought to exceed that of the Greeks in influence and in wealth. The inferior sects of Copts, Abyssinians, Syrians, Nestorians, Maronites, Chaldeans, &c. are scarcely perceptible in the crowd. And even the Jews are more remarkable from the striking peculiarity of their features and dress, than from their numbers, as contrasted with the other bodies.}}</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1824 || 6,000 || 10,000 || 4,000 || 20,000 || Fisk and King, Writers || <ref>Fisk and King, 'Description of Jerusalem,' in ''The Christian Magazine'', July 1824, page 220.

All of this directly influenced the expansion of Jerusalem beyond the city walls. From the mid-1850s to the early 1860s, several new buildings rose outside the walls, among them the mission house of the English consul, [[James Finn]], in what came to be known as Abraham\u2019s Vineyard ([[Kerem Avraham]]), the [[Jerusalem University College|Protestant school built]] by Bishop [[Samuel Gobat]] on Mount Zion; the [[Russian Compound]]; the [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim|Mishkenot Sha\u2019ananim]] houses: and the [[Schneller Orphanage complex]].

In addition, the number of Jewish immigrants from abroad choosing to settle in Jerusalem steadily increased. By 2010, there was a higher Jewish than Arab growth rate. That year, the city's birth rate was placed at 4.2 children for Jewish mothers, compared with 3.9 children for Arab mothers. In addition, 2,250 Jewish immigrants from abroad settled in Jerusalem.

A variety of views circulated about the [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.<ref>Edith Sanders: ''The Hamitic hypothesis: its origin and functions in time perspective'', ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1969), pp. 521\u2013532</ref> Some scholars argued that [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture was influenced by other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations in [[North Africa]] or the [[Middle East]], while others pointed to influences from various [[Nubians|Nubian]] groups or populations in [[Europe]].  In more recent times some writers continued to challenge the mainstream view, some focusing on questioning  the race of specific notable individuals such as the king represented in the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|native Egyptian]] pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic]] queen [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]].\n\nMainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and [[Egyptians|present day Egyptians]], applying modern notions of black or white [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] to ancient Egypt is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]].<ref name=\"Egypt pg 162\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AClFWV6PE8wC&pg=PA162&dq=brace,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&q=brace%2C%20egyptian%2C%20race&f=false |title=Black Athena Revisited |page=162 |access-date=2016-05-28|isbn=9780807845554 |last1=Lefkowitz |first1=Mary R |last2=Rogers |first2=Guy Maclean |year=1996 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ancient Egypt pg 329\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PG6HffPwmuMC&pg=PA329&dq=bard,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&q=race&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt |page=329 |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780415185899 |last1=Bard |first1=Kathryn A |last2=Shubert |first2=Steven Blake |year=1999 }}</ref><ref name=\"Race pg 19\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pFrm19cZhugC&pg=PA136&dq=race,+egypt,+anachronistic,+bard#v=snippet&q=race&f=false |title=Afrocentrism: Mythical Pasts and Imagined Homes |author=Stephen Howe |page=19 |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9781859842287 |year=1999 }}</ref> In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubia]], who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in ''[[The New-England Magazine]]'' of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that \"[[Herodotus]] was given as authority for their being negroes.\" They point out with reference to tomb paintings: \"It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the [[Negro]] countenance.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nwen;cc=nwen;rgn=full%20text;idno=nwen0005-4;didno=nwen0005-4;view=image;seq=00281;node=nwen0005-4%3A1|title=Original Papers: Ancient Egyptians |journal=The New-England Magazine|volume=0005|issue=4|date=October 1833|pages=273\u2013280}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney]], wrote \"The [[Copts]] are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians\" due to their \"jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips ... the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans\".{{sfn|Chasseboeuf|1862|p=131}}{{sfn|Chasseboeuf|1787|p=74\u201377}}\n\nJust a few years later, in 1839, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]] stated in his work ''Egypte Ancienne'' that the [[Egyptians]] and [[Nubians]] are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and [[relief]]s, further suggesting that: \"In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.\"{{sfn|Jacques Joseph|1839|p=27}} Also in 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by [[Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac]], who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating \"The opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.\"{{sfn|Milton|Bandia|2009|p=215}}\n\nThe debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery in the United States]], as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example, in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting \"There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost.... Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian.\"{{sfn|Campbell|1851|p=10\u201312}} The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as the United States escalated towards civil war.{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105\u2013108}} In 1854, [[Josiah C. Nott]] with George Glidden set out to prove: \"that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and ''that the Egyptians were Caucasians.''\"{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=108}} [[Samuel George Morton]], a physician and professor of anatomy, concluded that although \"Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is [in the United States], that of servants and slaves.\"{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105}} In the early 20th century, [[Flinders Petrie]], a Professor of Egyptology at the [[University of London]], in turn spoke of a Nubian queen, Aohmes Nefertari, who was the \"divine ancestress of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|XVIIIth dynasty]]\". He described her physically as having \"had an [[aquiline nose]], long and thin, and was of a type not in the least [[prognathous]]\".{{sfn|Petrie|1939|p=105, 155}}\n\nEgypt was not a popular civilization with all African Americans at the time, because they often associated Egypt with slavery. Black spirituals such as Go Down Moses related the slavery of blacks in America to the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://blogs.reinhardt.edu/history/thoughts-i-have-had-while-lecturing/ |title = Thoughts I have had while lecturing &#124; First Floor Tarpley}}</ref> As late as the 1960s, [[Martin Luther King]] and other civil rights leaders related the struggles of the Jews enslaved in Egypt to the struggles of African Americans.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://stanfordfreedomproject.com/multi-media-essays-on-freedom/the-biblical-exodus-in-the-rhetoric-of-martin-luther-king/ | title=The Biblical Exodus in the Rhetoric of Martin Luther King| date=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Position of modern scholarship==\n{{Main|Population history of Egypt}}\n{{see also|DNA history of Egypt}}\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|total_width=350\n| image1 = Gardens of Nakh 1.JPG\n| image2 = QueenHatshepsut-ExpeditionToPunt-PlasterCast-ROM.png\n| footer = '''Top:''' Gardens of Amun from the Temple of Karnak, painting in the tomb of Nakh, the chief gardener, early 14th century B.C.'''Bottom:'''An original image from the royal household of Queen [[Hatshepsut]].

Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a \"pastiche\" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius' notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person.

Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.<ref name=\"manuampim.com\"/>\n\n==Historical hypotheses==\n\n===Black Egyptian hypothesis===\n{{main|Black Egyptian hypothesis}}\n{{further|Kerma culture|Kingdom of Kush}}\nThe Black Egyptian hypothesis is held by various authors<ref>{{cite book|last=DuBois|first=W.E.B.|title=The World and Africa|year=2003|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7178-0221-0|pages=81\u2013147}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Chancellor|title=The Destruction of Black Civilization|year=1987|publisher=Third World Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-88378-030-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/destructionofbla00will_0/page/59 59\u2013135]|url=https://archive.org/details/destructionofbla00will_0/page/59}}</ref><ref name=\"Diop 1974\">{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20139,134\u2013155}}<ref name=\"Diop 1981\">{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=Civilization or Barbarism|url=https://archive.org/details/civilizationorba0000diop|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-048-8}}</ref>{{rp|103\u2013108}}<ref name=\"Mokhtar 1990 1\u2013118\">{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=1\u2013118}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John G.|title=Introduction to African Civilizations|year=1970|publisher=Citadel Press|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=978-0-8065-2189-3|pages=60\u2013156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sertima|first=Ivan Van|title=African Presence in Early Asia|year=1985|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, USA|isbn=978-0-88738-637-4|pages=59\u201365, 177\u2013185}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bernal|first=Martin|title=Black Athena|url=https://archive.org/details/blackathenaafroa00bern/page/63|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-1277-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackathenaafroa00bern/page/63 63\u201375, 98\u2013101, 439\u2013443]}}</ref><ref name=\"Robert Bauval\">{{cite web|last=Bauval|first=Robert|title=The Official Robert Bauval Website|url=http://www.robertbauval.co.uk/books.html|website=Black Genesis|publisher=Bear & Company|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> that ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa and a Black civilization.

A variety of views circulated about the [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.<ref>Edith Sanders: ''The Hamitic hypothesis: its origin and functions in time perspective'', ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1969), pp. 521\u2013532</ref> Some scholars argued that [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture was influenced by other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations in [[North Africa]] or the [[Middle East]], while others pointed to influences from various [[Nubians|Nubian]] groups or populations in [[Europe]].  In more recent times some writers continued to challenge the mainstream view, some focusing on questioning  the race of specific notable individuals such as the king represented in the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|native Egyptian]] pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic]] queen [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]].\n\nMainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and [[Egyptians|present day Egyptians]], applying modern notions of black or white [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] to ancient Egypt is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]].<ref name=\"Egypt pg 162\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AClFWV6PE8wC&pg=PA162&dq=brace,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&q=brace%2C%20egyptian%2C%20race&f=false |title=Black Athena Revisited |page=162 |access-date=2016-05-28|isbn=9780807845554 |last1=Lefkowitz |first1=Mary R |last2=Rogers |first2=Guy Maclean |year=1996 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ancient Egypt pg 329\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PG6HffPwmuMC&pg=PA329&dq=bard,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&q=race&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt |page=329 |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780415185899 |last1=Bard |first1=Kathryn A |last2=Shubert |first2=Steven Blake |year=1999 }}</ref><ref name=\"Race pg 19\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pFrm19cZhugC&pg=PA136&dq=race,+egypt,+anachronistic,+bard#v=snippet&q=race&f=false |title=Afrocentrism: Mythical Pasts and Imagined Homes |author=Stephen Howe |page=19 |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9781859842287 |year=1999 }}</ref> In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubia]], who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in ''[[The New-England Magazine]]'' of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that \"[[Herodotus]] was given as authority for their being negroes.\" They point out with reference to tomb paintings: \"It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the [[Negro]] countenance.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nwen;cc=nwen;rgn=full%20text;idno=nwen0005-4;didno=nwen0005-4;view=image;seq=00281;node=nwen0005-4%3A1|title=Original Papers: Ancient Egyptians |journal=The New-England Magazine|volume=0005|issue=4|date=October 1833|pages=273\u2013280}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney]], wrote \"The [[Copts]] are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians\" due to their \"jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips ... the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans\".{{sfn|Chasseboeuf|1862|p=131}}{{sfn|Chasseboeuf|1787|p=74\u201377}}\n\nJust a few years later, in 1839, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]] stated in his work ''Egypte Ancienne'' that the [[Egyptians]] and [[Nubians]] are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and [[relief]]s, further suggesting that: \"In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.\"{{sfn|Jacques Joseph|1839|p=27}} Also in 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by [[Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac]], who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating \"The opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.\"{{sfn|Milton|Bandia|2009|p=215}}\n\nThe debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery in the United States]], as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example, in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting \"There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost.... Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian.\"{{sfn|Campbell|1851|p=10\u201312}} The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as the United States escalated towards civil war.{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105\u2013108}} In 1854, [[Josiah C. Nott]] with George Glidden set out to prove: \"that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and ''that the Egyptians were Caucasians.''\"{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=108}} [[Samuel George Morton]], a physician and professor of anatomy, concluded that although \"Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is [in the United States], that of servants and slaves.\"{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=105}} In the early 20th century, [[Flinders Petrie]], a Professor of Egyptology at the [[University of London]], in turn spoke of a Nubian queen, Aohmes Nefertari, who was the \"divine ancestress of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|XVIIIth dynasty]]\".

Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence that \"proves\" that the ancient Egyptians were black, under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses \"European\" scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.<ref>\"Ra-Hotep and Nofret: Modern Forgeries in the Cairo Museum?\" pp. 207\u2013212 in Egypt: Child of Africa (1994), edited by Ivan Van Sertima.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://manuampim.com/ |title=AFRICANA STUDIES |publisher=Manuampim.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Races2.jpg|thumb|250px|1820 drawing of a ''[[Book of Gates]]'' fresco of the tomb of [[Seti I]], depicting (from left) four groups of people: [[Libyans]] (\"Themehu\"), a [[Nubia]]n (\"Nehesu\"), an [[Levant|Asiatic]] (\"Aamu\"), and an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] (\"Reth\").]]\nAmpim has a specific concern about the painting of the \"Table of Nations\" in the Tomb of Ramses III (KV11).

The RETH are [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]].\"\n\nThe archaeologist Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work ''Denkm\u00e4ler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien.'' In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section, called the \"Erg\u00e4nzungsband\" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius' original work. One of them, plate 48, illustrated one example of each of the four \"nations\" as depicted in KV11, and shows the \"Egyptian nation\" and the \"Nubian nation\" as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Professor Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting, and that it \"proves\" that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the [[Nubians]], even though he admits no other examples of the \"Table of Nations\" show this similarity. He has further accused \"Euro-American writers\" of attempting to mislead the public on this issue.<ref name=\"manuampim.com\">{{cite web|url=http://manuampim.com/ramesesIII.htm |title=Africana Studies. Tomb of Rameses III |publisher=Manuampim.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>\n\nThe late Egyptologist, Frank Yurco, visited the tomb of Ramses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Erg\u00e4nzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a \"pastiche\" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius' notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings.<ref>Frank Yurco, \"Two Tomb-Wall Painted Reliefs of Ramesses III and Sety I and Ancient Nile Valley Population Diversity\", in ''Egypt in Africa'' (1996), ed. by Theodore Celenko.</ref> (Erik Hornung, ''The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity'', 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.<ref name=\"manuampim.com\"/>\n\n==Historical hypotheses==\n\n===Black Egyptian hypothesis===\n{{main|Black Egyptian hypothesis}}\n{{further|Kerma culture|Kingdom of Kush}}\nThe Black Egyptian hypothesis is held by various authors<ref>{{cite book|last=DuBois|first=W.E.B.|title=The World and Africa|year=2003|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7178-0221-0|pages=81\u2013147}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Chancellor|title=The Destruction of Black Civilization|year=1987|publisher=Third World Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-88378-030-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/destructionofbla00will_0/page/59 59\u2013135]|url=https://archive.org/details/destructionofbla00will_0/page/59}}</ref><ref name=\"Diop 1974\">{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20139,134\u2013155}}<ref name=\"Diop 1981\">{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=Civilization or Barbarism|url=https://archive.org/details/civilizationorba0000diop|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-048-8}}</ref>{{rp|103\u2013108}}<ref name=\"Mokhtar 1990 1\u2013118\">{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=1\u2013118}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John G.|title=Introduction to African Civilizations|year=1970|publisher=Citadel Press|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=978-0-8065-2189-3|pages=60\u2013156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sertima|first=Ivan Van|title=African Presence in Early Asia|year=1985|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, USA|isbn=978-0-88738-637-4|pages=59\u201365, 177\u2013185}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bernal|first=Martin|title=Black Athena|url=https://archive.org/details/blackathenaafroa00bern/page/63|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-1277-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackathenaafroa00bern/page/63 63\u201375, 98\u2013101, 439\u2013443]}}</ref><ref name=\"Robert Bauval\">{{cite web|last=Bauval|first=Robert|title=The Official Robert Bauval Website|url=http://www.robertbauval.co.uk/books.html|website=Black Genesis|publisher=Bear & Company|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> that ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa and a Black civilization.

This theory was the most dominant view from the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 500 AD) all the way up to the early 19th century.<ref>\"The Hamitic Hypothesis; Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective\", Edith R.

In sharp contrast to the Asiatic race theory, neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.<ref>Sanders, 1969, pp. 524\u2013527ff.</ref>\n\n=== Caucasian / Hamitic hypothesis===\nIn 1844, [[Samuel George Morton]] wrote that the Nile valley \"was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race\",<ref>''The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian Race: A Political History of Racial Identity'' By Bruce Baum, p. 108</ref> and acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants.<ref name=\"morton\">{{cite book|first=Samuel George |last=Morton|authorlink=Samuel George Morton|title=Crania \u00c6gyptiaca, Or, Observations on Egyptian Ethnography Derived from Anatomy, History and the Monuments|chapter=Egyptian Ethnography|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1MGAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA4,M1|year=1844}}</ref> [[George Gliddon]] (1844) wrote: \"The Egyptians were white men, of no darker hue than a pure Arab, a Jew, or a Phoenician.\"<ref>George Robins Gliddon ''Ancient Egypt: Her monuments, hieroglyphics, history and archaeology'' 1844, p. 46</ref>\n\nThe similar [[Hamitic]] hypothesis, which developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the [[Ethiopid]] and [[Arabid]] populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted that these people were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name.<ref>Sanders, 1969, pp. 525\u2013532.</ref> [[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] in his ''Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan'' (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.<ref name=Selig1913>C.G. Seligman, \"Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\", ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 43 (July\u2013December 1913), pp. 593\u2013705.</ref>\n\nThe Italian anthropologist [[Giuseppe Sergi]] (1901) believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African ([[Hamitic]]) branch of the [[Mediterranean race]], which he called \"Eurafrican\". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or \"Eurafrican\" contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean \"proper\" branch and the Nordic (depigmented) branch.<ref>''The Mediterranean Race: a Study of the Origins of European Peoples'', 1901, pp. v\u2013vi, \"Preface\", also p. 45.</ref> Sergi maintained in summary that the [[Mediterranean race]] (excluding the depigmented Nordic or 'white') is: \"a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples\".<ref>Sergi, 1901, p. 250.</ref> [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] modified the theory in 1911,<ref>\"Concepts of Race in the Historiography of Northeast Africa\", Wyatt MacGaffey, ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1966.</ref> stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired \"brown race\",<ref>''The Ancient Egyptians and the origin of Civilization'', 1911, p. 69.</ref>  most closely \"linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe\",<ref>Smith, 1911, p. 25.</ref> and not [[Negroid]].<ref>As according to Smith the hair of the \"Proto-Egyptian was precisely similar to that of the brunet South European\" and \"presented no resemblance whatever to the so-called 'wooly' appearance and peppercorn-like arrangement of the Negro's hair\". \u2013 Smith, 1911, p. 58.</ref> Smith's \"brown race\" is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi's Mediterranean race.<ref>\"Neither in Sergi's nor in Elliot Smith's scheme are Brown and Mediterranean equivalent terms.\" \u2013 MacGaffey, 1966, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 1960s and late 1970s and was supported notably by [[Anthony John Arkell]] and [[George Peter Murdock]].<ref>Sanders, 1969, pp. 531; MacGaffey, 1966, pp. 5\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Turanid race hypothesis===\nThe Egyptologist [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] (1846) proposed that the ancient Egyptians belonged to the [[Turanid race]], linking them to the [[Tatars]]. He was inspired by some ancient Egyptian paintings, which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said \"From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow, like that of the Mongul Tartars, who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race.... The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars.\"<ref>''History of Egypt'', 1846, Part I, p. 3 \"The Asiatic Origin of the Race.</ref>\n\n===Dynastic race theory===\n{{Main|Dynastic race theory}}\nIn the early 20th century, [[Flinders Petrie]], one of the leading Egyptologists of his day, noted that the skeletal remains found at predynastic sites at [[Naqada]] in Upper Egypt showed marked differentiation. Together with cultural evidence such as architectural styles, pottery styles, cylinder seals, and numerous rock and tomb paintings, he deduced that a [[Mesopotamia]]n force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times, imposed itself on the indigenous Badarian people, and become their rulers. This came to be called the \"[[dynastic race theory]]\".<ref name=\"Egypt p. 15\">''Early dynastic Egypt'', by Toby A. H.

Scholars such as the Senegalese Egyptologist [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], fought against the Dynastic Race Theory with their own \"Black Egyptian\" theory and claimed, among other things, that European scholars supported the Dynastic Race Theory \"to avoid having to admit that Ancient Egyptians were black\".<ref>Epic encounters: culture, media, and U.S. interests in the Middle East \u2013 1945\u20132000 by Melani McAlister</ref> [[Martin Bernal]] proposed that the Dynastic Race theory was conceived by European scholars to deny Egypt its African roots.<ref>''Black Athena Revisited'', by Mary R.

She was originally worshiped in [[Sumer]] and was later worshipped by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]], and [[Assyria]]ns under the name '''Ishtar'''.{{efn|{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|t|\u0251\u02d0r|}}; {{transl|sux|<sup>[[Dingir|D]]</sup>i\u0161tar}}{{sfn|Heffron|2016}}}} She was known as the \"[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]\" and was the patron goddess of the [[Eanna]] temple at the city of [[Uruk]], which was her main [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] center. She was associated with the planet [[Venus]] and her most prominent symbols included the [[Lion of Babylon|lion]] and the [[Star of Ishtar|eight-pointed star]]. Her husband was the god [[Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz) and her ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, was the goddess [[Ninshubur]] (who later became the male deity [[Papsukkal]]).\n\nInanna was worshiped in [[Sumer]] at least as early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), but she had little cult prior to the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xviii}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} with temples across [[Mesopotamia]]. The cult of Inanna-Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of sexual rites, was continued by the [[East Semitic]]-speaking people ([[Akkadians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region. She was especially beloved by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own [[national god]] [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. Inanna-Ishtar is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and she greatly influenced the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte|Astoreth]], who later influenced the development of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries AD in the wake of [[Christianity]], though it survived in parts of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities as late as the eighteenth century.\n \nInanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xv}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=42\u201343}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She was believed to have stolen the ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'', which represented all positive and negative aspects of civilization, from [[Enki]], the god of wisdom. She was also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother [[Utu]] (later known as Shamash), Inanna was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]]; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener [[Shukaletuda]] after he [[rape]]d her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in [[divine retribution]] for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar asks [[Gilgamesh]] to become her consort. When he refuses, she unleashes the [[Bull of Heaven]], resulting in the death of [[Enkidu]] and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his mortality.\n\nInanna-Ishtar's most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from ''[[Kur]]'', the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|ancient Sumerian Underworld]], a myth in which she attempts to conquer the domain of her older sister [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, but is instead deemed guilty of [[hubris]] by the [[Anunnaki|seven judges of the Underworld]] and struck dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back, but all of them refuse her except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna. They escort Inanna out of the Underworld, but the ''[[gallu|galla]]'', the guardians of the Underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the Underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year while his sister [[Geshtinanna]] remains in the Underworld for the other half, resulting in the cycle of the seasons.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:VAM Nisaba Lagasch.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a stone plaque from the temple of Inanna at [[Nippur]] showing a Sumerian goddess, possibly Inanna ({{circa|2500}} BC){{snf|Collins|1994|pages=114\u2013115}}]]\n[[File:Anubanini relief constituents Ishtar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ishtar on the [[Anubanini rock relief]], circa 2300-2000 BC.]]\nInanna and Ishtar were originally separate, unrelated deities,{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but they were equated with each other during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and came to be regarded as effectively the same goddess under two different names.{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} Inanna's name may derive from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] phrase ''nin-an-ak'', meaning \"Lady of Heaven\",{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} but the cuneiform sign for ''Inanna'' ({{cuneiform|\ud808\ude39}}) is not a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of the signs ''lady'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[ERE\u0160|nin]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udea9\ud808\udf06}} SAL.TUG<sub>2</sub>) and ''sky'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[DINGIR|an]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udc2d}} AN).{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xiii\u2013xix}} These difficulties led some early [[Assyriologists]] to suggest that Inanna may have originally been a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], who was only later accepted into the [[Sumerian pantheon]]. This idea was supported by Inanna's youthfulness, and as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.{{snf|Rubio|1999|pages=1\u201316}}\n\nThe name ''Ishtar'' occurs as an element in personal names from both the pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonic]] and post-Sargonic eras in Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} It is of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] derivation{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} and is probably etymologically related to the name of the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who is mentioned in later inscriptions from [[Ugarit]] and southern Arabia.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} The morning star may have been conceived as a male deity who presided over the arts of war and the evening star may have been conceived as a female deity who presided over the arts of love.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} Among the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the name of the male god eventually supplanted the name of his female counterpart,{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but, due to extensive syncretism with Inanna, the deity remained as female, despite the fact that her name was in the masculine form.{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}}\n\n==Origins and development==\n[[File:Warka_vase_(background_retouched).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Uruk Vase]].{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=51}}]]\n\nInanna has posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}} Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a [[syncretism]] between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a [[Semitic deity]] who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=228\u2013229}}\n\nAs early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} The famous [[Uruk Vase]] (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}} and bringing sheep and goats to a [[female figure]] facing the ruler.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} The female stands in front of Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign signifying the [[EN (cuneiform)|''En'']], or high priest of the temple.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=552\u2013554}}\n\nSeal impressions from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] ({{circa}} 3100 \u2013 {{circa}} 2900 BC) show a fixed sequence of symbols representing various cities, including those of [[Ur]], [[Larsa]], [[Zabalam]], [[Urum (Babylonia)|Urum]], [[Arina]], and probably [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]].{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} This list probably reflects the report of contributions to Inanna at Uruk from cities supporting her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} A large number of similar seals have been discovered from phase I of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]] ({{circa}} 2900 \u2013 {{circa}} 2350 BC) at [[Ur]], in a slightly different order, combined with the rosette symbol of Inanna.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} These seals were used to lock storerooms to preserve materials set aside for her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}}\n\nDuring the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian period]] ({{circa}}\u20092334 \u2013 2154 BC), following the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]], Inanna and Ishtar became so extensively syncretized that they became regarded as effectively the same.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} The Akkadian poet [[Enheduanna]], the daughter of Sargon, wrote numerous hymns to Inanna, identifying her with Ishtar.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}} Sargon himself proclaimed Inanna and An as the sources of his authority.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} As a result of this,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}

[[Assur|A\u0161\u0161ur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] (modern Erbil).{{sfn|Guirand|1968|page=58}} During the reign of the Assyrian king [[Assurbanipal]], Ishtar rose to become the most important and widely

they performed elegies and lamentations.{{sfn|Leick|1994|page=285}} ''Gala'' took female names, spoke in the ''[[Sumerian language#Dialects|eme-sal]]'' dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in [[Gay sexual practices|homosexual intercourse]].{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=65}} During the Akkadian Period, ''kurgarr\u016b'' and ''assinnu'' were servants of Ishtar who [[cross-dressing|dressed in female clothing]] and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|pages=65\u201366}} Several Akkadian [[proverb]]s seem to suggest that

the contemporary Indian ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=158\u2013163}} In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=66}}\n\nAccording to the early scholar [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], towards the end of the third millennium BC, kings of Uruk may have established their legitimacy by taking on the role of the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], Inanna's consort.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} This ritual lasted for one night on the tenth day of the

syncretism.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=156}} During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 \u2013 609 BC), the rosette may have actually eclipsed the eight-pointed star and become Ishtar's primary symbol.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=156\u2013157}} The temple of Ishtar in the city of [[A\u0161\u0161ur]] was adorned with numerous

with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} In ''Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'', unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for ''Kur'', what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} In ''Inanna and Shukaletuda'', Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=163\u2013164}} In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}}\n\nBecause the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as single entity;{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} Nonetheless, a [[cylinder seal]] from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] indicates that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}} The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161\u2013172}}\n\nInanna in her aspect as Anun\u012btu was associated with the eastern fish of the last of the zodiacal constellations, [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].{{sfn|Foxvog|1993|page=106}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=34\u201335}} Her consort Dumuzi was associated with the contiguous first constellation, [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].{{sfn|Foxvog|1993|page=106}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Ishtar Eshnunna Louvre AO12456.jpg|Babylonian terracotta relief of Ishtar from [[Eshnunna]] (early second millennium BC)\nFile:Deesse au vase (Mari).jpg|Life-sized statue of a goddess, probably Ishtar, holding a vase from [[Mari, Syria]] (eighteenth century BC)\nFile:Winged goddess-AO6501-IMG 0638-black.jpg|Terracotta relief of Ishtar with wings from [[Larsa]] (second millennium BC)\nFile:Naked woman holding her breasts-Sb 7742-IMG 0880-black.jpg|Statuette of woman clutching her breasts, possibly representing Ishtar, from [[Susa]] ({{circa}} 1300 \u2013 {{circa}} 1100 BC)<ref>{{citation|last=Pumpelly|first=Raphael|title=Ancient Anau and the Oasis-World and General Discussion of Results|journal=Explorations in Turkestan: Expedition of 1904: Prehistoric Civilizations of Anau: Origins, Growth and Influence of Environment|date=1908|volume=73|issue=1|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OvtZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=goddess+figurine+from+Susa#v=onepage&q=goddess%20figurine%20from%20Susa&f=false|accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref>\nFile:Ishtar - stele of Shamsh-res-usur, governor of Mari and Suhi.jpg|Stele showing Ishtar holding a bow from [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]] (eighth century BC)\nFile:IshtarDamascusMuseum.jpg|[[Hellenistic art|Hellenized]] bas-relief sculpture of Ishtar standing with her servant from [[Palmyra]] (third century AD)\n</gallery>\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Seal of Inanna, 2350-2150 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] [[cylinder seal]] depicting Inanna resting her foot on the back of a lion while [[Ninshubur]] stands in front of her paying obeisance, {{circa}} 2334 \u2013 {{circa}} 2154 BC{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=92, 193}}]]\n\nThe [[Sumer]]ians worshipped Inanna as the goddess of both warfare and sexuality.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} Unlike other gods, whose roles were static and whose domains were limited, the stories of Inanna describe her as moving from conquest to conquest.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=15\u201317}} She was portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power than she had been allotted.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=15\u201317}}\n\nAlthough she was worshipped as the goddess of love, Inanna was not the goddess of marriage, nor was she ever viewed as a mother goddess.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pp=108\u20139}}{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=65\u201366}} A description of her from one of her hymns declares, \"When the servants let the flocks loose, and when cattle and sheep are returned to cow-pen and sheepfold, then, my lady, like the nameless poor, you wear only a single garment.

When Inanna ascends from the underworld, it is through Ereshkigal's powers, but, while Inanna is in the underworld, it is Ereshkigal who apparently takes on the powers of fertility. The poem ends with a line in praise, not of Inanna, but of Ereshkigal.

other powerful female deities from antiquity, have been marginalized by modern culture in favor of male deities.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]] has argued that Inanna was a \"marginal figure\" in Sumerian religion who embodies the \"socially unacceptable\" [[archetype]] of the \"undomesticated, unattached woman\".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Johanna Stuckey has argued

Cowan has also criticized the portrayal of Inanna in modern Neopaganism, remarking that it \"reduces [her] to little more than a patron goddess of parking lots and crawlspaces\".{{sfn|Cowan|2005|page=49}}\n\n==Dates (approximate)==\n\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible nowraplinks\" style=\"background-color:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; background-color:#aaf\" |<span style=\"font-size:110%;\">'''Historical sources'''</span>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:right; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Time'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Period'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Source'''\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|5300\u20134100}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ubaid period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|4100\u20132900}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Uruk period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Warka Vase|Uruk vase]]{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}}\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2900\u20132334}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | Early Dynastic period\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2334\u20132218}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Akkadian Empire]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | writings by [[Enheduanna]]:{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}}<br />\n''Nin-me-\u0161ara'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n''In-nin \u0161a-gur-ra'', \"A Hymn to Inanna (Inana C)\"<br />\n''In-nin me-hu\u0161-a'', \"Inanna and Ebih\"<br />\n''The Temple Hymns''<br />\n''Hymn to Nanna'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2218\u20132047}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Gutian Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2047\u20131940}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ur III|Ur III Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''<br />\n''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]''<br />\n''Inanna and Enki''{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=90}}<br />\n''Inanna's Descent into the Underworld''<br />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n*[[Anat]]\n*[[Asherah]]\n*[[Holy Spirit]]\n*[[Isis]]\n*[[Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Nana (Kushan goddess)]]\n*[[Nanaya]]\n*[[Sophia (Gnosticism)]]\n*[[Star of Ishtar]]\n*[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation|last=Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2006|orig-year=1989|title=Gender and Difference in Ancient Israel|editor-last=Day|editor-first=Peggy Lynne|url=https://books.google.com/?id=38aX_-PqViIC&pg=PA116&dq=mourning+over+the+death+of+Tammuz#v=onepage&q=mourning%20over%20the%20death%20of%20Tammuz&f=false|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2393-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Assante|first=Julia|date=2003|article=From Whores to Hierodules: The Historiographic Invention of Mesopotamian Female Sex Professionals|title=Ancient Art and Its Historiography|editor1-last=Donahue|editor1-first=A.

She was originally worshiped in [[Sumer]] and was later worshipped by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]], and [[Assyria]]ns under the name '''Ishtar'''.{{efn|{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|t|\u0251\u02d0r|}}; {{transl|sux|<sup>[[Dingir|D]]</sup>i\u0161tar}}{{sfn|Heffron|2016}}}} She was known as the \"[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]\" and was the patron goddess of the [[Eanna]] temple at the city of [[Uruk]], which was her main [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] center. She was associated with the planet [[Venus]] and her most prominent symbols included the [[Lion of Babylon|lion]] and the [[Star of Ishtar|eight-pointed star]]. Her husband was the god [[Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz) and her ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, was the goddess [[Ninshubur]] (who later became the male deity [[Papsukkal]]).\n\nInanna was worshiped in [[Sumer]] at least as early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), but she had little cult prior to the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xviii}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} with temples across [[Mesopotamia]]. The cult of Inanna-Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of sexual rites, was continued by the [[East Semitic]]-speaking people ([[Akkadians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region. She was especially beloved by the [[Assyrians]], who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own [[national god]] [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. Inanna-Ishtar is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and she greatly influenced the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte|Astoreth]], who later influenced the development of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries AD in the wake of [[Christianity]], though it survived in parts of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities as late as the eighteenth century.\n \nInanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xv}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=42\u201343}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She was believed to have stolen the ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'', which represented all positive and negative aspects of civilization, from [[Enki]], the god of wisdom. She was also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother [[Utu]] (later known as Shamash), Inanna was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]]; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener [[Shukaletuda]] after he [[rape]]d her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in [[divine retribution]] for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar asks [[Gilgamesh]] to become her consort. When he refuses, she unleashes the [[Bull of Heaven]], resulting in the death of [[Enkidu]] and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his mortality.\n\nInanna-Ishtar's most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from ''[[Kur]]'', the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|ancient Sumerian Underworld]], a myth in which she attempts to conquer the domain of her older sister [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, but is instead deemed guilty of [[hubris]] by the [[Anunnaki|seven judges of the Underworld]] and struck dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back, but all of them refuse her except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna. They escort Inanna out of the Underworld, but the ''[[gallu|galla]]'', the guardians of the Underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the Underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year while his sister [[Geshtinanna]] remains in the Underworld for the other half, resulting in the cycle of the seasons.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:VAM Nisaba Lagasch.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a stone plaque from the temple of Inanna at [[Nippur]] showing a Sumerian goddess, possibly Inanna ({{circa|2500}} BC){{snf|Collins|1994|pages=114\u2013115}}]]\n[[File:Anubanini relief constituents Ishtar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ishtar on the [[Anubanini rock relief]], circa 2300-2000 BC.]]\nInanna and Ishtar were originally separate, unrelated deities,{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but they were equated with each other during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and came to be regarded as effectively the same goddess under two different names.{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} Inanna's name may derive from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] phrase ''nin-an-ak'', meaning \"Lady of Heaven\",{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} but the cuneiform sign for ''Inanna'' ({{cuneiform|\ud808\ude39}}) is not a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of the signs ''lady'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[ERE\u0160|nin]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udea9\ud808\udf06}} SAL.TUG<sub>2</sub>) and ''sky'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[DINGIR|an]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udc2d}} AN).{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xiii\u2013xix}} These difficulties led some early [[Assyriologists]] to suggest that Inanna may have originally been a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], who was only later accepted into the [[Sumerian pantheon]]. This idea was supported by Inanna's youthfulness, and as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.{{snf|Rubio|1999|pages=1\u201316}}\n\nThe name ''Ishtar'' occurs as an element in personal names from both the pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonic]] and post-Sargonic eras in Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} It is of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] derivation{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} and is probably etymologically related to the name of the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who is mentioned in later inscriptions from [[Ugarit]] and southern Arabia.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} The morning star may have been conceived as a male deity who presided over the arts of war and the evening star may have been conceived as a female deity who presided over the arts of love.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} Among the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the name of the male god eventually supplanted the name of his female counterpart,{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but, due to extensive syncretism with Inanna, the deity remained as female, despite the fact that her name was in the masculine form.{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}}\n\n==Origins and development==\n[[File:Warka_vase_(background_retouched).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Uruk Vase]].{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=51}}]]\n\nInanna has posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}} Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a [[syncretism]] between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a [[Semitic deity]] who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=228\u2013229}}\n\nAs early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} The famous [[Uruk Vase]] (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}} and bringing sheep and goats to a [[female figure]] facing the ruler.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} The female stands in front of Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign signifying the [[EN (cuneiform)|''En'']], or high priest of the temple.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=552\u2013554}}\n\nSeal impressions from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] ({{circa}} 3100 \u2013 {{circa}} 2900 BC) show a fixed sequence of symbols representing various cities, including those of [[Ur]], [[Larsa]], [[Zabalam]], [[Urum (Babylonia)|Urum]], [[Arina]], and probably [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]].{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} This list probably

Cowan has also criticized the portrayal of Inanna in modern Neopaganism, remarking that it \"reduces [her] to little more than a patron goddess of parking lots and crawlspaces\".{{sfn|Cowan|2005|page=49}}\n\n==Dates (approximate)==\n\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible nowraplinks\" style=\"background-color:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; background-color:#aaf\" |<span style=\"font-size:110%;\">'''Historical sources'''</span>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:right; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Time'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Period'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Source'''\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|5300\u20134100}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ubaid period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|4100\u20132900}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Uruk period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Warka Vase|Uruk vase]]{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}}\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2900\u20132334}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | Early Dynastic period\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2334\u20132218}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Akkadian Empire]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | writings by [[Enheduanna]]:{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}}<br />\n''Nin-me-\u0161ara'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n''In-nin \u0161a-gur-ra'', \"A Hymn to Inanna (Inana C)\"<br />\n''In-nin me-hu\u0161-a'', \"Inanna and Ebih\"<br />\n''The Temple Hymns''<br />\n''Hymn to Nanna'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2218\u20132047}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Gutian Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2047\u20131940}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ur III|Ur III Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''<br />\n''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]''<br />\n''Inanna and Enki''{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=90}}<br />\n''Inanna's Descent into the Underworld''<br />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n*[[Anat]]\n*[[Asherah]]\n*[[Holy Spirit]]\n*[[Isis]]\n*[[Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Nana (Kushan goddess)]]\n*[[Nanaya]]\n*[[Sophia (Gnosticism)]]\n*[[Star of Ishtar]]\n*[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation|last=Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2006|orig-year=1989|title=Gender and Difference in Ancient Israel|editor-last=Day|editor-first=Peggy Lynne|url=https://books.google.com/?id=38aX_-PqViIC&pg=PA116&dq=mourning+over+the+death+of+Tammuz#v=onepage&q=mourning%20over%20the%20death%20of%20Tammuz&f=false|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2393-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Assante|first=Julia|date=2003|article=From Whores to Hierodules: The Historiographic Invention of Mesopotamian Female Sex Professionals|title=Ancient Art and Its Historiography|editor1-last=Donahue|editor1-first=A.
