The diesel and 2.2 petrol carried on with the extended grille. In late 1984 a four-wheel-drive version was introduced. This was a [[Four-wheel drive#Part-time|part-time system]] coupled with the diesel engine and a five-speed manual transmission. This model operated as a front-wheel-drive until the rear wheels were engaged with a [[dog clutch]], a system similar to the one used by Renault on the [[Renault 18|R18 4x4]].<ref name=AGp18>{{cite journal | ref = AG140 | journal = De AutoGids | number = 140 | volume = 6 | page = 18 | title = 63e salon voor bedrijfsvoertuigen: Geen schokkende dingen | trans-title = The 63rd commercial vehicle exhibition: Nothing shocking | first = Tony | last = Verhelle | language = nl-be | date = 7 February 1985 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, the Trafic underwent a major front end facelift, with a rounder shape and a plastic bumper, and the new longer body shape covering all varieties of engine. In 1995, the Mk1 Trafic got its final facelift, with new grille, new tail lights, large double rear view mirrors, and a new interior with modern dashboard and multi adjustable seats.\n\nThis version was also sold as the '''Opel Arena''' from 1997.\n\n===Winnebago===\nThe chassis and cab of the 1980s models were used as the base vehicle by [[Winnebago Industries]] to build the Winnebago '[[Winnebago LeSharo|LeSharo]]' from 1983,<ref>{{cite web|title=Curbside Classic: 1985 Winnebago|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/05/curbside-classic-1985-winnebago-23mpg-lesharo-turbo-diesel-rv/|work=Truth about cars|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> and Itasca Phasar.\n\nFor the chassis and cab version to meet safety and emission requirements in the United States, this version was sold with Renault's J7T: 2165&nbsp;cc, (2.2 litre) and 2.1 litre diesel and turbo diesel engines, coded as J8S and shared with the 1985 to 1987 AMC/Jeep Cherokee/Commanche.\n\nNote: Jeep versions used the Garrett T2 turbo and Winnebago's, the larger T3. C.A.R.B. granted a series of yearly waivers to Winnebago for the non compliance of fitting On Board Diagnostics (OBD I), and remained in effect throughout the model run from 1983 to 1992.\n\n===Campervan Variants===\nThe Mk1 Trafic became popular for professional conversion into budget family motorhomes due to the flexibility of the design and the generous internal space for what was a relatively small van. Popular converters were Auto-Sleepers and Holdsworth (now defunct). Other motorhome builders using the Trafic Mk1 as a base include Hymer, Elddis, Eriba, and Autostar.\n\n===Opel Arena===\n{{For|the stadium|Opel Arena (stadium)}}\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Renault Trafic was marketed as the Chevrolet Trafic and Opel Arena (Vauxhall Arena in the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|title=Opel History|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|publisher=General Motors|accessdate=24 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227141155/http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|date=1 December 2006|archivedate=27 February 2007 |quote=1997: With the Arena, Opel reenters the commercial vehicle market segment.}}</ref>\n\n===Tata Winger===\n{{main|Tata Winger}}\nIn June 2007, [[Tata Motors]] announced the introduction of the [[Tata Winger|Winger]], a panel van and minibus based on the 1995 to 2001 version of the Renault Trafic, but fitted with Tata's own two litre diesel engines, with or without turbo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tata Motors says holding margins a challenge |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/06/18/idUKBOM23581620070618 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=18 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\nFor South America, the vehicle was made in the Argentinian facility at Santa Isabel, C\u00f3rdoba, for the Mercosur.

The diesel and 2.2 petrol carried on with the extended grille. In late 1984 a four-wheel-drive version was introduced. This was a [[Four-wheel drive#Part-time|part-time system]] coupled with the diesel engine and a five-speed manual transmission. This model operated as a front-wheel-drive until the rear wheels were engaged with a [[dog clutch]], a system similar to the one used by Renault on the [[Renault 18|R18 4x4]].<ref name=AGp18>{{cite journal | ref = AG140 | journal = De AutoGids | number = 140 | volume = 6 | page = 18 | title = 63e salon voor bedrijfsvoertuigen: Geen schokkende dingen | trans-title = The 63rd commercial vehicle exhibition: Nothing shocking | first = Tony | last = Verhelle | language = nl-be | date = 7 February 1985 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, the Trafic underwent a major front end facelift, with a rounder shape and a plastic bumper, and the new longer body shape covering all varieties of engine. In 1995, the Mk1 Trafic got its final facelift, with new grille, new tail lights, large double rear view mirrors, and a new interior with modern dashboard and multi adjustable seats.\n\nThis version was also sold as the '''Opel Arena''' from 1997.\n\n===Winnebago===\nThe chassis and cab of the 1980s models were used as the base vehicle by [[Winnebago Industries]] to build the Winnebago '[[Winnebago LeSharo|LeSharo]]' from 1983,<ref>{{cite web|title=Curbside Classic: 1985 Winnebago|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/05/curbside-classic-1985-winnebago-23mpg-lesharo-turbo-diesel-rv/|work=Truth about cars|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> and Itasca Phasar. \n\nFor the chassis and cab version to meet safety and emission requirements in the United States, this version was sold with Renault's J7T: 2165&nbsp;cc, (2.2 litre) and 2.1 litre diesel and turbo diesel engines, coded as J8S and shared with the 1985 to 1987 AMC/Jeep Cherokee/Commanche. \n\nNote: Jeep versions used the Garrett T2 turbo and Winnebago's, the larger T3. C.A.R.B. granted a series of yearly waivers to Winnebago for the non compliance of fitting On Board Diagnostics (OBD I), and remained in effect throughout the model run from 1983 to 1992.\n\n===Campervan Variants===\nThe Mk1 Trafic became popular for professional conversion into budget family motorhomes due to the flexibility of the design and the generous internal space for what was a relatively small van. Popular converters were Auto-Sleepers and Holdsworth (now defunct). Other motorhome builders using the Trafic Mk1 as a base include Hymer, Elddis, Eriba, and Autostar.\n\n===Opel Arena===\n{{For|the stadium|Opel Arena (stadium)}}\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Renault Trafic was marketed as the Chevrolet Trafic and Opel Arena (Vauxhall Arena in the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|title=Opel History|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|publisher=General Motors|accessdate=24 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227141155/http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|date=1 December 2006|archivedate=27 February 2007 |quote=1997: With the Arena, Opel reenters the commercial vehicle market segment.}}</ref>\n\n===Tata Winger===\n{{main|Tata Winger}}\nIn June 2007, [[Tata Motors]] announced the introduction of the [[Tata Winger|Winger]], a panel van and minibus based on the 1995 to 2001 version of the Renault Trafic, but fitted with Tata's own two litre diesel engines, with or without turbo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tata Motors says holding margins a challenge |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/06/18/idUKBOM23581620070618 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=18 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\nFor South America, the vehicle was made in the Argentinian facility at Santa Isabel, C\u00f3rdoba, for the Mercosur.

There have been no new releases since the release of Ragnahog in December 1, 2016 and It was removed From [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]] in December 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\nJust as in the original ''Angry Birds'', players use a [[slingshot]] to launch an assortment of birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. The main targets are the pigs, and they can be defeated if directly fired at, or through other strategies, e.g.: the bird hits a structure that falls on the pig, defeating it. Small sized pigs are weak and easily defeated, while bigger pigs can sustain more damage. Each level pack represents a different \"season\", often based upon different themes and holidays. Different level packs have each unique theme and sometimes much different gameplay.\n\n==Release==\n===2010===\n'''''Season 2010''''' started in October 2010, when Rovio released a [[Halloween]] edition.<ref name=\"Joystiq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-halloween-edition-spooks-ipad-iphone/|title=Angry Birds Halloween edition spooks iPad, iPhone|author=Richard Mitchell|work=Joystiq.com|date=October 21, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024223244/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-halloween-edition-spooks-ipad-iphone/|archive-date=October 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Angry Birds Halloween'', exclusive to iOS at the time and a separate game, included levels with Halloween-themed music and graphics.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> In December 2010, Rovio released ''Angry Birds Seasons'' to iOS, Android and Symbian 3 devices.<ref name=\"TNW\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-goes-live-and-free-for-ios-and-android/|title=Angry Birds Seasons goes live and free for iOS and Android|author=Jeff Cormier|work=The Next Web|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"AAS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/12402_Angry_Birds_Seasons.php|title=Review: Angry Birds Seasons|author=Ewan Spence|work=AllAboutSymbian.com|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> ''Seasons'' introduced 25 Christmas-themed levels, one for each day leading to the holiday, similar to an [[Advent calendar]].<ref name=\"TNW\"/><ref name=\"AAS\"/> All versions include the previously-exclusive Halloween levels and are offered as separate, stand-alone paid applications, with the exception of the free, ad-supported Android version;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-is-holiday-themed-out-for-android-and-ios-t/|title=Angry Birds Seasons out for Android and iOS today, free to Halloween users|author=Vlad Bobleanta|work=switched.com|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> ''Angry Birds Halloween'' users on iOS received the ''Seasons'' levels as a free upgrade.<ref name=\"TNW\"/> The Halloween version was given the episode title \"Trick or Treat\", while the Christmas episode was entitled \"Season's Greedings\".\n\n===2011===\n'''''Season 2011''''' began in February 2011, when Rovio released a [[Valentine's Day]] update to ''Angry Birds Seasons'', entitled \"Hogs and Kisses\", complete with new themed levels and graphics, as well as the option to send ''Angry Birds''-themed Valentine's Day messages through Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/07/angry-birds-valentines-day/|title=Angry Birds Gets Facebook-Infused Valentine's Day Edition|author=Christina Warren|work=Mashable.com|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> In March 2011, Rovio released a new [[St. Patrick's Day]] update, entitled \"Go Green, Get Lucky\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angrybirdsnest.com/2011/03/angry-birds-seasons-go-green-get-lucky-update-is-here/|title=Angry Birds Seasons Go Green, Get Lucky Update is Here!|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> followed by an Easter update, entitled \"Easter Eggs\", in April 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383717,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Seasons Gets Easter Update|author=Chloe Albanesius|work=PCMag.com|date=April 18, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> and a summer update, \"Summer Pignic\", in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+Seasons/news.asp?c=30902|title=Angry Birds Seasons Summer Pignic update hits the App Store, adds 30 levels|author=Rob Hearn|work=PocketGamer.co.uk|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> In September 2011, \"Mooncake Festival\" was released in conjunction with the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].<ref>[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/119/1192115p1.html Angry Birds Seasons Moon Festival Episode Released] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202232106/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/119/1192115p1.html |date=2011-12-02 }}, IGN, 1 September 2011.

With this update, the episodes were arranged to the year they were released, not as it was previously; the \"Winter Wonderham\" episode, which was in ''Seasons 2013'', was moved to ''Seasons 2012'', as the episode was released in 2012.\n\n===2015===\n'''''Season 2015''''' rang in February 2015, a 2nd part was added to Ham Dunk- \"All-Star Weekend 2015\", expanding the world to 60 levels (more than Trick or Treat, which has 45)- this update allowed the player to use Shockwave (electrical Bomb) for free, but only in Ham Dunk and for a limited time. At the extreme end of April (the 30th), a tropical world set on an unspecified Pacific island. The world was added in commemoration to Rovio's partnership with [[BirdLife International]] to save the birds of the Pacific. About a month later (June), a 3rd Ham Dunk update, celebrating The Finals,  was added- ultimately expanding the total levels of Ham Dunk to 67. Between this update and the next was about 4 months, giving Rovio a \"rest\" and letting them handle other Angry Birds games. Finally, in October 2015, a 50's movie-themed world was added to the selection, titled \"Invasion of the Egg Snatchers\", which not only brought a new world, but BirdWear ([[costumes]]), which are unlocked in a [[scavenger hunt]] style, having the player search through levels they completed for certain items, and once 3 items were found (there is a 16-hour wait between obtaining items and an 8-hour wait to get a new mission), they would receive the costume, allowing the birds to (optionally) wear outfits during gameplay. Another new feature in the update was the Power-Up Test Zone, which lets the player test Power-Ups (with infinite uses). Finally, to wrap up 2015, \"[[Ski]] or Squeal\" was added (in the usual [[advent calendar]] style), taking place a top a frigid mountain [[summit]].\n\n===2016===\n'''''Season 2016''''' (final season) began on February 11, 2016 (2 months after the Angry Birds 6th birthday), a [[Valentine's Day]] episode was released, entitled \"Fairy Hogmother\", which is set in a [[fairytale]] storybook, featuring magic wands that trigger actions when hit, and (strangely) imprisoned Birds that give the player an extra Bird when the cage (holding the Bird) is destroyed. As [[Spring (season)|spring]] rolled around about a month later, a new episode was released, called \"Marie Hamtionette\" (after [[Marie Antoinette]], queen of France in the 1700s), which is set in the garden of Ludpig XVI's ([[Louis XVI]]) estate, complete with [[hedge]]s and [[topiary]]s across a wide landscape. On June 27, 2016, summer 2016 kicked off with a new summer-themed world entitled \"Summer Camp\", which is (hence the name) a [[summer camp]] set in a mountainous forest at dawn, including many popular activities one would find at a camp, including [[human swimming]], [[archery]], [[rock climbing]], and many more popular summer activities. The summer 2016 update also added a new mode to the course of gameplay, \"The Pig Challenge\", which is set in a [[tournament]] style format, having players compete against friends and other players in a randomized set of weekly levels for trophies and power-ups. Fall 2016 started with \"Piggywood Studios\" where the Pigs reenact famous movie scenes from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and more. It continued with the Halloween episode \"Hammier Things\", which was based on TV series ''[[Stranger Things (TV series)|Stranger Things]]'', and concluded with the Christmas episode \"Ragnahog\", which is set in a Nordic theme.\n\n==Ports==\nAt the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], Rovio and distribution partner [[Activision]] announced plans to bring ''Angry Birds Seasons'', along with the original ''Angry Birds'' and ''Angry Birds Rio'', to the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] systems.<ref name=\"3PS360\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/10/angry-birds-trilogy-coming-to-ps3-360-and-3ds|title=Angry Birds Trilogy Coming to PS3, 360 and 3DS|author=Greg Miller|work=ign.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|date=2012-07-10|accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Bundled together as ''[[Angry Birds Trilogy]]'', the games will be built specifically for their respective consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for [[PlayStation Move]], [[Kinect]], high-definition displays and glasses-free [[Stereoscopy|3D visuals]].<ref name=\"3PS360\"/>\n\nIt is also available for [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]] as part of ''[[Angry Birds Trilogy]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = iOS (''HD''): 78/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/angry-birds-seasons-hd |title=Angry Birds: Seasons HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe reception of ''Angry Birds Seasons'' has been positive.

There have been no new releases since the release of Ragnahog in December 1, 2016 and It was removed From [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]] in December 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\nJust as in the original ''Angry Birds'', players use a [[slingshot]] to launch an assortment of birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. The main targets are the pigs, and they can be defeated if directly fired at, or through other strategies, e.g.: the bird hits a structure that falls on the pig, defeating it. Small sized pigs are weak and easily defeated, while bigger pigs can sustain more damage. Each level pack represents a different \"season\", often based upon different themes and holidays. Different level packs have each unique theme and sometimes much different gameplay.\n\n==Release==\n===2010===\n'''''Season 2010''''' started in October 2010, when Rovio released a [[Halloween]] edition.<ref name=\"Joystiq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-halloween-edition-spooks-ipad-iphone/|title=Angry Birds Halloween edition spooks iPad, iPhone|author=Richard Mitchell|work=Joystiq.com|date=October 21, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024223244/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-halloween-edition-spooks-ipad-iphone/|archive-date=October 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Angry Birds Halloween'', exclusive to iOS at the time and a separate game, included levels with Halloween-themed music and graphics.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> In December 2010, Rovio released ''Angry Birds Seasons'' to iOS, Android and Symbian 3 devices.<ref name=\"TNW\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-goes-live-and-free-for-ios-and-android/|title=Angry Birds Seasons goes live and free for iOS and Android|author=Jeff Cormier|work=The Next Web|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"AAS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/12402_Angry_Birds_Seasons.php|title=Review: Angry Birds Seasons|author=Ewan Spence|work=AllAboutSymbian.com|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> ''Seasons'' introduced 25 Christmas-themed levels, one for each day leading to the holiday, similar to an [[Advent calendar]].<ref name=\"TNW\"/><ref name=\"AAS\"/> All versions include the previously-exclusive Halloween levels and are offered as separate, stand-alone paid applications, with the exception of the free, ad-supported Android version;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-is-holiday-themed-out-for-android-and-ios-t/|title=Angry Birds Seasons out for Android and iOS today, free to Halloween users|author=Vlad Bobleanta|work=switched.com|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> ''Angry Birds Halloween'' users on iOS received the ''Seasons'' levels as a free upgrade.<ref name=\"TNW\"/> The Halloween version was given the episode title \"Trick or Treat\", while the Christmas episode was entitled \"Season's Greedings\".\n\n===2011===\n'''''Season 2011''''' began in February 2011, when Rovio released a [[Valentine's Day]] update to ''Angry Birds Seasons'', entitled \"Hogs and Kisses\", complete with new themed levels and graphics, as well as the option to send ''Angry Birds''-themed Valentine's Day messages through Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/07/angry-birds-valentines-day/|title=Angry Birds Gets Facebook-Infused Valentine's Day Edition|author=Christina Warren|work=Mashable.com|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> In March 2011, Rovio released a new [[St. Patrick's Day]] update, entitled \"Go Green, Get Lucky\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angrybirdsnest.com/2011/03/angry-birds-seasons-go-green-get-lucky-update-is-here/|title=Angry Birds Seasons Go Green, Get Lucky Update is Here!|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> followed by an Easter update, entitled \"Easter Eggs\", in April 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383717,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Seasons Gets Easter Update|author=Chloe Albanesius|work=PCMag.com|date=April 18, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> and a summer update, \"Summer Pignic\", in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+Seasons/news.asp?c=30902|title=Angry Birds Seasons Summer Pignic update hits the App Store, adds 30 levels|author=Rob Hearn|work=PocketGamer.co.uk|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> In September 2011, \"Mooncake Festival\" was released in conjunction with the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].<ref>[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/119/1192115p1.html Angry Birds Seasons Moon Festival Episode Released] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202232106/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/119/1192115p1.html |date=2011-12-02 }}, IGN, 1 September 2011.

{"title_page": "Hegemonic masculinity", "text_new": "{{Technical|date=May 2017}}\n{{masculism sidebar}}\nIn [[gender studies]], '''hegemonic masculinity''' is part of [[Raewyn Connell|R.&nbsp;W. Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined. According to [R.&nbsp;W.] Connell, contemporary hegemonic masculinity is built on two legs, domination of women and a hierarchy of intermale dominance. It is also shaped to a significant extent by the stigmatization of homosexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today\u2019s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}\n}}\n\n===History===\nConnell first proposed the concept of hegemonic masculinity in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;<ref name=Kessler1982>{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers & disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}</ref> in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;<ref name=Con1983>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up?

In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,<ref name=Hearn>{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,<ref name=Petersen>{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&ndash;69 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod<ref name=Brod>{{cite book | last = Brod | first = Harry | author-link = Harry Brod | chapter = Some thoughts on some histories of some masculinities: Jews and other others | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXk5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA82 | editor-last1 = Brod | editor-first1 = Harry | editor-last2 = Kaufman | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-link1 = Harry Brod | editor-link2 = Michael Kaufman (author) | title = Theorizing masculinities | pages = [https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 82&ndash;96] | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780803949041 | url = https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 }}</ref> observes that there is a tendency in [[men's studies]] field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\n===Ambiguity and overlap===\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Many men who hold great social power do not embody other aspects of ideal masculinity. Martin<ref name=Martin>{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman? Reflections on Connell's ''Masculinities'' | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 472&ndash;474 | doi = 10.1177/089124398012004008 | date = August 1998 | ref = harv}}</ref> criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley<ref name=Weth>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism & Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&ndash;356 | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | ref = harv| url = http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/4025/1/186657_4318%20Edley%20PostPrint.pdf }}</ref> contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead<ref name=White>{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}</ref> suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}</ref> argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&ndash;111 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Lifespan development==\n===Early childhood===\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\">{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&ndash;307 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | ref = harv }}\n*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}</ref> This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.<ref name=\"Bhana, D. 2009\">{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = \"Boys will be boys\": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&ndash;339 | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity.

The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy.

[[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\"/> A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality.

Thus, most GC men support an idea of manliness associated with showing bravery in the national struggle as well as armed solutions to political problems, even if they themselves do not necessarily embody. Moreover, this ideal was distinguished from other co-existing masculinities that were seen as \u2018subordinated\u2019 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Connell, R. W.

For example, models of masculinity that did not provide a strong interest in the military culture, disliked guns, were critical about heroism or supported more peaceful solutions to the Cyprus problem, such as coming closer, reproaching the Turkish Cypriot community were broadly seen as weaker forms of being a man.

In addition, proudly serving conscription in a difficult unit and showing attachment to the nationalist ideals were the pinnacle attributes of the post-war male. In turn, hegemonic masculinity shaping and being shaped by nationalism and militarism places GC men who appeal to a bi-communal solution, cross the border or interact with the \u2018other\u2019 at risk of failing the hegemonic model of masculinity. In other words, it is challenging for GC men to find a way to respectfully relate to their self, if they attempt to come closer to TCs, because of the nationalist militarist way that masculinity is shaped in Cyprus <ref>{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity After the Construction of the Border|date=2019|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_2|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|pages=23\u201353|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\n==Toxic masculinity==\n{{main|Toxic masculinity}}\nConnell argues that an important feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''[[toxic masculinity]]'' to refer to stereotypically masculine [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s that can be expressed (see [[affect display]]) by boys and men, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"[[alpha male]]\").<ref name=\"Liu 2016\">{{cite news|url=http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083303/http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=How Trump's 'Toxic Masculinity' Is Bad for Other Men|last=Liu|first=William Ming|date=14 April 2016|work=Motto (Time)|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to Terry Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination\".

Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined.

Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today\u2019s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}\n}}\n\n===History===\nConnell first proposed the concept of hegemonic masculinity in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;<ref name=Kessler1982>{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers & disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}</ref> in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;<ref name=Con1983>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up?

In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view.

The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body.

Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}</ref> argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&ndash;111 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Lifespan development==\n===Early childhood===\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\">{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&ndash;307 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | ref = harv }}\n*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}</ref> This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.<ref name=\"Bhana, D. 2009\">{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = \"Boys will be boys\": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&ndash;339 | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity. Children learn and show development of gender identity as an ongoing process, based on social situations. Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in [[early childhood]]. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community.<ref name=\"Levant 1996\">{{cite journal |last=Levant |first=Ronald F. |title=The new psychology of men |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |date=1996 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013265 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.27.3.259 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232569489}}</ref><ref name=\"Weir\">{{cite journal |last=Weir |first=Kirsten |title=The men America left behind |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=February 2017 |volume=48 |issue=2 |page=34 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/02/men-left-behind.aspx |language=en}}</ref> Media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}}\n\nAlthough gender socialization is well underway before children reach preschool, stereotypical differences between boys and girls are typically reinforced, rather than diminished, by their early educational childhood experiences.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\">{{cite journal | last = Gelb | first = Steven A. | title = Language and the problem of male salience in early childhood classroom environments | journal = [[Early Childhood Research Quarterly]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 205&ndash;215 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | date = June 1989 | ref = harv }}</ref> Teachers have a large role in reinforcing gender stereotypes by limiting children's choices at this young age, thus not allowing boys to explore their feelings or their understandings about gender freely.

[[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.\n\nThe male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Oransky | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Celia | title = The development and validation of the meaning of adolescent masculinity scale | journal = [[Psychology of Men and Masculinity]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 57&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1037/a0013612 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity.

Stratis-Andreas Efthymiou points to how certain discourses projected to the international community, portraying post-conflict Cyprus, as a feminized victim in need of protection and deliverance, such as one of the mothers of the missing persons, were internally addressed with the masculinist ideology of \u2018defence\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|date=2016-09-30|title=Militarism in post-war Cyprus: the development of the ideology of defence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126|journal=Defence Studies|volume=16|issue=4|pages=408\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126|issn=1470-2436}}</ref>. The masculinist militarist assertiveness of the Cypriot state and people over the \u2018occupation\u2019 forces, generated a range of militarized roles for men, which opposed the idea of effeminacy marked by retreat, submissiveness and acceptance that the territory \u2018occupied\u2019 by Turkey was lost forever and thus no longer \u2018occupied\u2019<ref>{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity After the Construction of the Border|date=2019|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_2|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|pages=23\u201353|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>.\n\nHooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\" /> War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\n==Toxic masculinity==\n{{main|Toxic masculinity}}\nConnell argues that an important feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''[[toxic masculinity]]'' to refer to stereotypically masculine [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s that can be expressed (see [[affect display]]) by boys and men, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"[[alpha male]]\").<ref name=\"Liu 2016\">{{cite news|url=http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083303/http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=How Trump's 'Toxic Masculinity' Is Bad for Other Men|last=Liu|first=William Ming|date=14 April 2016|work=Motto (Time)|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to Terry Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination\".

It consisted of the northernmost territories of the [[Ionian League]] of [[Greeks|Greek]]  settlements. Never a unified state, it was named after the [[Ionians|Ionian tribe]] who, in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] (600\u2013480 BC), settled mainly the shores and islands of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Ionian states were identified by tradition and by their use of [[Ancient Greek dialects#Groups|Eastern Greek]].\n\nIonia proper comprised a narrow coastal strip from [[Phocaea]] in the north near the mouth of the river [[Hermus]] (now the [[Gediz River|Gediz]]), to [[Miletus]] in the south near the mouth of the river [[Maeander]], and included the islands of [[Chios]] and [[Samos]]. It was bounded by [[Aeolis|Aeolia]] to the north, [[Lydia]] to the east and [[Caria]] to the south. The cities within the region figured large in the strife between the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and the Greeks.\n\nAccording to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition, the cities of Ionia were founded by [[colonists]] from the other side of the Aegean. Their settlement was connected with the legendary history of the Ionic people in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]], which asserts that the colonists were led by Neleus and Androclus, sons of [[Codrus]], the last [[king of Athens]]. In accordance with this view the \"Ionic migration\", as it was called by later chronologers, was dated by them one hundred and forty years after the [[Trojan War]], or sixty years after the return of the [[Heracleidae]] into the [[Peloponnese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography: Volume II Iabadius-Zymethus|location=London|publisher=Walton and Maberly|year=1857|pages=''Ionia'' pages 60\u201361}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39908/39908-h/39908-h.htm#ar78|title=Ionia}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Physical===\nIonia was of small extent, not exceeding {{convert|150|km|mi|-1}} in length from north to south, with a breadth varying from {{convert|60|to|90|km|mi|-1}}, but to this must be added the peninsula of [[Karaburun|Mimas]], together with the two islands. So intricate is the coastline that the voyage along its shores was estimated at nearly four times the direct distance. A great part of this area was, moreover, occupied by mountains. Of these the most lofty and striking were Mimas and Corycus, in the peninsula which stands out to the west, facing the island of Chios; [[Mount Sipylus|Sipylus]], to the north of Smyrna, Corax, extending to the south-west from the Gulf of Smyrna, and descending to the sea between Lebedus and Teos; and the strongly marked range of [[Mycale]], a continuation of Messogisin the interior, which forms the bold headland of Trogilium or Mycale, opposite Samos. None of these mountains attains a height of more than {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}}. The district comprised three extremely fertile valleys formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in Asia Minor: the [[Hermus]] in the north, flowing into the [[Gulf of Smyrna]], though at some distance from the city of that name; the Caster, which flowed under the walls of Ephesus; and the [[Maeander]], which in ancient times discharged its waters into the deep gulf that once bathed the walls of Miletus, but which has been gradually filled up by this river's deposits. With the advantage of a peculiarly fine climate, for which this part of [[Asia Minor]] has been famous in all ages, Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times of being the most fertile of all the rich provinces of Asia Minor; and even {{as of|1911|alt=in modern times}}, though very imperfectly cultivated, it produces abundance of fruit of all kinds, and the [[raisin]]s and [[ficus|fig]]s of Smyrna supply almost all the markets of Europe.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39908/39908-h/39908-h.htm#ar78|title=Ionia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Phocaea map.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Northern Ionia, view from space.]]\n\n===Political===\nThe geography of Ionia placed it in a strategic position that was both advantageous and disadvantageous. Ionia was always a maritime power founded by a people who made their living by trade in peaceful times and marauding in unsettled times. The coast was rocky and the arable land slight. The native Luwians for the most part kept their fields further inland and used the rift valleys for wooded pasture. The coastal cities were placed in defensible positions on islands or headlands situated so as to control inland routes up the rift valleys. The people of those valleys were of different ethnicity. The populations of the cities came from many civilizations in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Demography==\nAncient demographics are available only from literary sources. [[Herodotus]] states that in Asia the Ionians kept the division into twelve cities that had prevailed in Ionian lands of the north Peloponnese, their former homeland, which became [[Achaea]] after they left.<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D145 1.145].</ref> These Asian cities were (from south to north) [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Ephesus]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Lebedos]], [[Teos]], [[Erythrae]], [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]], together with [[Samos]] and [[Chios]].<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D142 1.142].</ref> [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]], originally an [[Aeolis|Aeolic]] colony, was afterwards occupied by Ionians from Colophon, and became an Ionian city \u2014 an event which had taken place before the time of Herodotus.<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D143 1.143], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D149 1.149\u2013150].</ref>\n[[File:Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia.jpg|thumb|left|Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia]]\nThese cities do not match those of [[Achaea]]. Moreover, the Achaea of Herodotus' time spoke [[Doric Greek|Doric]] (Corinthian), but in [[Homer]] it is portrayed as being in the kingdom of [[Mycenae]], which most likely spoke [[Mycenaean Greek]], which is not Doric. If the Ionians came from Achaea, they departed during or after the change from East Greek to West Greek there. Mycenaean continued to evolve in the mountainous region of [[Arcadia]].\n\nThere is no record of any people named Ionians in [[Bronze Age#Ancient Near East|Late Bronze Age]] Anatolia but [[Hittite texts]] record the Achaeans of [[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiyawa]], of location not completely certain, but in touch with the Hittites of that time. [[Miletus]] and some other cities founded earlier by non-Greeks received populations of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] probably under the name of Achaeans. The tradition of Ionian colonizers from Achaea suggests that they may have been known by both names even then. In the absence of archaeological evidence of discontinuity at Miletus the Achaean population whatever their name appears to have descended to archaic Ionia, which does not exclude the possibility of another colonizing and founding event from Athens.\n\nIn the Indian (e.g.: Tamil) historic literary texts, the Ionians are referred to as [[Yona|\"yavana\" or \"yona\"]], and are described as wearing leather and wielding whips.\nIn modern Turkish, the people of that region and the Greeks were called \"yunan\" (plural \"yunanlar\") and the country that is now Greece is known as \"Yunanistan\".\n\nHerodotus expresses some impatience at the ethnic views of his countrymen concerning Ionia: \"for it would be foolishness to say that these are more truly Ionian or better born ....\"<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D146 1.146].</ref> He lists other ethnic populations among the settlers: Abantes from [[Euboea]], [[Minyans]] from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], Cadmeians, [[Dryopia]]ns, [[Phocis|Phocians]], [[Molossians]], Arcadian [[Pelasgians]], [[Dorians]] of [[Epidaurus]], and others. The presence of Doric Ionians is somewhat contradictory, but Herodotus himself, a major author of the Ionic dialect, was from a Doric city, [[Halicarnassus]]. Even \" the best born of the Ionians\", the Athenians, married girls from [[Caria]]. \"Yet since they set more store by the name than the rest of the Ionians, let it be granted that those of pure birth are Ionians.\"<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D147 1.147].</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Western Asia Minor Greek Colonization.svg|230px|right|thumb|Greek settlements in western [[Asia Minor]], Ionian area in green.]]\nFrom the 18th century BC the region was a part of the [[Hittite Empire]] with possible name [[Arzawa]], which was destroyed by invaders during the 12th century BC together with the collapse of the Empire. Ionia was settled by the Greeks probably during the 11th century BC. The most important city was [[Miletus]] (the ''Millawanda/Milawata'' of Hittites).\nSeveral centuries later Ionia was the place where [[Western philosophy]] began and was the homeland of [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and [[Heraclitus]]. They were natural-philosophers of the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]] and tried to explain the phenomena according to non-supernatural laws. They also searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of things (origin) and this conception had a great influence on the early archaic art in Greece.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Main article|First Greek colonisation}}\nDuring the late 13th century BC the peoples of the [[Aegean Sea]] took to marauding and resettling as a way of life and were called by the Egyptians the [[Sea Peoples]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Mycenaean Greeks must have been among them. They settled lightly on the shores of [[Luwian]] Anatolia often by invitation. In the background was the stabilizing influence of the Hittites, who monitored maritime movement and suppressed piracy. When that power was gone the Luwian people remained in the vacuum as a number of coastal splinter states that were scarcely able now to defend themselves. Ionian Greeks took advantage of opportunities for coastal raiding: an inscription of [[Sargon II]] (ca 709\u201307, recording a naval expedition of 715) boasts \"in the midst of the sea\" he had \"caught the Ionians like fish and brought peace to the land of Que [[Cilicia]] and the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]\".<ref name=\"Fox 2008\">Sargon's inscription in A. Fuchs, ''Die Inschriften Sargons II aus Khorsabad'' (1994:40) noted in Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:29f.</ref> For a full generation earlier Assyrian inscriptions had recorded troubles with the Ionians, who escaped on their boats.<ref name=\"Fox 2008\" />\n\n[[Caria]] and [[Lycia]] came to the attention of [[Athens]], most powerful state remaining in Greece, which also had lost its central government ruling from [[Mycenae]], now burned and nearly vacant. Ionians had been expelled from the [[Peloponnesus]] by the [[Dorians]] and had sought refuge in Athens. The Athenian kings decided to relieve the crowding by resettling the coast of Lydia with Ionians from the Peloponnesus under native Athenian leadership.\n\n[[File:Miletus Northern Agora.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The site of [[Miletus]], once coastal, now inland. The plain was a bay in [[Classical Greece]].]]\n\nThey were not the only Greeks to have such a perception and reach such a decision. The [[Aeolians]] of [[Boeotia]] contemporaneously settled the coast to the north of the Ionians and the newly arrived  [[Dorians]] of [[Crete]] and the islands the coast of [[Caria]]. The Greeks descended on the [[Luwians]] of the Anatolian coast in the 10th century BC. The descent was not peaceful and the Luwians were not willing.\n\n[[File:Ionia, placchetta in osso di gorgone in corsa con serpenti, 575-550 ac ca.jpg|thumb|upright|Gorgone with serpent, Ionia, 575-550 BC.]]\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] gives a thumbnail sketch of the resettlement.<ref>''Guide to Greece'' Book 7 Sections 5\u20137.</ref> [[Miletus]] was the first city attacked, where there had been some Mycenaean Greeks apparently under the rule of [[Crete|Cretans]]. After overthrowing the Cretan government and settling there the Ionians widened their attack to [[Ephesus]], [[Samos]] and [[Priene]]. Combining with [[Aeolians]] from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] they founded [[Myus]]. [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] was already in the hands of Aeolians who had arrived via Crete in Mycenaean times. The Ionians \"swore a treaty of union\" with them. They took [[Lebedos]] driving out the Carians and augmented the Aeolian population of [[Teos]]. They settled on [[Chios]], took [[Erythrae]] from the Carians, Pamphylians (both Luwian) and Cretans. [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]] were settled from [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Somewhat later they took [[Smyrna]] from the Aeolians.\n\n===Brief autonomy===\n{{main|Ionian League|Panionium|Delos}}\nThe Ionian cities formed a religious and cultural (as opposed to a political or military) confederacy, the [[Ionian League]], of which participation in the [[Panionia|Panionic festival]] was a distinguishing characteristic. This festival took place on the north slope of [[Mt. Mycale]] in a shrine called the [[Panionium]]. In addition to the Panionic festival at Mycale, which was celebrated mainly by the Asian Ionians, both European and Asian coast Ionians convened on [[Delos]] Island each summer to worship at the temple of the Delian [[Apollo]].\n\nBut like the [[Amphictyonic league]] in Greece, the Ionic was rather of a sacred than a political character; every city enjoyed absolute autonomy, and, though common interests often united them for a common political object, they never formed a real confederacy like that of the Achaeans or [[Boeotia]]ns. The advice of [[Thales]] of Miletus to combine in a political union was rejected.\n\nThe colonies naturally became prosperous. [[Miletus]] especially was at an early period one of the most important commercial cities of Greece; and in its turn became the parent of numerous other colonies, which extended all around the shores of the [[Euxine Sea]] and the Propontis from Abydus and [[Cyzicus]] to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] and Panticapaeum. [[Phocaea]] was one of the first Greek cities whose mariners explored the shores of the western Mediterranean. [[Ephesus]], though it did not send out any colonies of importance, from an early period became a flourishing city and attained to a position corresponding in some measure to that of Smyrna at the present day.\n\n===Under the last Anatolian empire===\n[[File:IONIA, Uncertain. Circa 600-550 BC.jpg|thumb|Possible coin of Ionia. Circa 600-550 BC]]\nAbout 700 BC [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], first Mermnad king of [[Lydia]], invaded the territories of Smyrna and Miletus, and is said to have taken [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] as his son Ardys did Priene. The first event in the history of Ionia for which there is a trustworthy account is the inroad of the [[Cimmerians|Cimmerii]], who ravaged a great part of Asia Minor, including Lydia, and sacked [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], but were foiled in their attack upon Ephesus. This event may be referred to the middle of the 7th century BC. It was not until the reign of [[Croesus]] (560\u2013545 BC) that the cities of Ionia fell completely under Lydian rule.\n\n===Satrapy of the Achaemenids===\n{{main|Ionia (satrapy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| image1   = Xerxes I tomb Ionian soldier circa 470 BCE cleaned up.jpg\n| width1   = 130\n| caption1 = <center>Ionian soldier of the Achaemenid army, circa 480 BCE.

In this position they enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy, but were for the most part subject to local despots, most of whom were creatures of the Persian king. It was at the instigation of one of these despots, [[Histiaeus of Miletus]], that in about 500 BC the principal cities ignited the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persia. They were at first assisted by the Athenians and [[Eretria]], with whose aid they penetrated into the interior and burnt Sardis, an event which ultimately led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian invasion of Greece]]. But the fleet of the Ionians was defeated off the island of [[Battle of Lade|Lade]], and the destruction of Miletus after a protracted siege was followed by the reconquest of all the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well as continental.\n\n===Autonomy under the Athenian empire===\nThe victories of the Greeks during the great Persian war and the liberation of [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]], and Ionia from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] had the effect of enfranchising their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegean; and the [[Battle of Mycale]] (479 BC), in which the defeat of the Persians was in great measure owing to the Ionians, secured their emancipation. They henceforth became the dependent allies of Athens (see [[Delian League]]), though still retaining their autonomy, which they preserved until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387 BC once more placed them as well as the other Greek cities in Asia under the nominal dominion of Persia.\n\n===Satrapy again (387-335 BC)===\n[[File:IONIA, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC.jpg|thumb|Ionia, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC]]\nIonian cities appear to have retained a considerable amount of freedom until the conquest of Asia Minor by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nAfter the [[battle of the Granicus]] most of the Ionian cities submitted to the rule of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] of [[Macedon]] and his [[Diadochi]]. As such Ionia enjoyed a great prosperity during the [[Hellenistic]] times with the notable exception of [[Miletus]], which, being the only city of the [[Ionian League]] to deny to pay homage to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], was finally leveled after a long siege at 334 [[Before Christ|BC]], and never restored to its previous splendor.\n\n===Under Rome===\nIonia became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 133 BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History |title=Ionia |first=Jan |last=Breder |date=26 October 2012 |isbn=9781405179355 |doi=10.1002/9781444338386 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]] |oclc=230191195}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIonia has a long roll of distinguished men of letters and science (notably the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] of philosophy) and distinct school of art. This school flourished between 700 and 500 BC. The great names of this school are [[Theodorus of Samos|Theodorus]] and Rhoecus of Samos; [[Bathycles of Magnesia|Bathycles]] of [[Magnesia on the Maeander]]; [[Glaucus of Chios]], Melas, Micciades, Archermus, [[Bupalus|Bupalus and Athenis]] of [[Chios]]. Notable works of the school still extant are the famous archaic female statues found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1885\u20131887, the seated statues of Branchidae, the Nike of Archermus found at Delos, and the objects in [[ivory]] and [[electrum]] found by D.G. Hogarth in the lower strata of the Artemision at Ephesus.\n\nThe [[Persian language|Persian]] designation for [[Greek language|Greek]] is ''Younan'' (\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646), a transliteration of \"Ionia\", through [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''Yauna''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindner|first1=Rudi Paul|title=Explorations in Ottoman Prehistory|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=978-0-47209-507-0|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JMUAfa3GFVQC&pg=PA19&dq=yunan+yauna#v=onepage&q=yunan%20yauna&f=false|quote=The name \"Yunan\" comes from Ionia; cf.

It consisted of the northernmost territories of the [[Ionian League]] of [[Greeks|Greek]]  settlements. Never a unified state, it was named after the [[Ionians|Ionian tribe]] who, in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] (600\u2013480 BC), settled mainly the shores and islands of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Ionian states were identified by tradition and by their use of [[Ancient Greek dialects#Groups|Eastern Greek]].\n\nIonia proper comprised a narrow coastal strip from [[Phocaea]] in the north near the mouth of the river [[Hermus]] (now the [[Gediz River|Gediz]]), to [[Miletus]] in the south near the mouth of the river [[Maeander]], and included the islands of [[Chios]] and [[Samos]]. It was bounded by [[Aeolis|Aeolia]] to the north, [[Lydia]] to the east and [[Caria]] to the south. The cities within the region figured large in the strife between the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and the Greeks.\n\nAccording to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition, the cities of Ionia were founded by [[colonists]] from the other side of the Aegean. Their settlement was connected with the legendary history of the Ionic people in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]], which asserts that the colonists were led by Neleus and Androclus, sons of [[Codrus]], the last [[king of Athens]]. In accordance with this view the \"Ionic migration\", as it was called by later chronologers, was dated by them one hundred and forty years after the [[Trojan War]], or sixty years after the return of the [[Heracleidae]] into the [[Peloponnese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography: Volume II Iabadius-Zymethus|location=London|publisher=Walton and Maberly|year=1857|pages=''Ionia'' pages 60\u201361}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39908/39908-h/39908-h.htm#ar78|title=Ionia}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Physical===\nIonia was of small extent, not exceeding {{convert|150|km|mi|-1}} in length from north to south, with a breadth varying from {{convert|60|to|90|km|mi|-1}}, but to this must be added the peninsula of [[Karaburun|Mimas]], together with the two islands. So intricate is the coastline that the voyage along its shores was estimated at nearly four times the direct distance. A great part of this area was, moreover, occupied by mountains. Of these the most lofty and striking were Mimas and Corycus, in the peninsula which stands out to the west, facing the island of Chios; [[Mount Sipylus|Sipylus]], to the north of Smyrna, Corax, extending to the south-west from the Gulf of Smyrna, and descending to the sea between Lebedus and Teos; and the strongly marked range of [[Mycale]], a continuation of Messogisin the interior, which forms the bold headland of Trogilium or Mycale, opposite Samos. None of these mountains attains a height of more than {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}}. The district comprised three extremely fertile valleys formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in Asia Minor: the [[Hermus]] in the north, flowing into the [[Gulf of Smyrna]], though at some distance from the city of that name; the Caster, which flowed under the walls of Ephesus; and the [[Maeander]], which in ancient times discharged its waters into the deep gulf that once bathed the walls of Miletus, but which has been gradually filled up by this river's deposits. With the advantage of a peculiarly fine climate, for which this part of [[Asia Minor]] has been famous in all ages, Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times of being the most fertile of all the rich provinces of Asia Minor; and even {{as of|1911|alt=in modern times}}, though very imperfectly cultivated, it produces abundance of fruit of all kinds, and the [[raisin]]s and [[ficus|fig]]s of Smyrna supply almost all the markets of Europe.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39908/39908-h/39908-h.htm#ar78|title=Ionia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Phocaea map.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Northern Ionia, view from space.]]\n\n===Political===\nThe geography of Ionia placed it in a strategic position that was both advantageous and disadvantageous. Ionia was always a maritime power founded by a people who made their living by trade in peaceful times and marauding in unsettled times. The coast was rocky and the arable land slight. The native Luwians for the most part kept their fields further inland and used the rift valleys for wooded pasture. The coastal cities were placed in defensible positions on islands or headlands situated so as to control inland routes up the rift valleys. The people of those valleys were of different ethnicity. The populations of the cities came from many civilizations in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Demography==\nAncient demographics are available only from literary sources. [[Herodotus]] states that in Asia the Ionians kept the division into twelve cities that had prevailed in Ionian lands of the north Peloponnese, their former homeland, which became [[Achaea]] after they left.<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D145 1.145].</ref> These Asian cities were (from south to north) [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Ephesus]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Lebedos]], [[Teos]], [[Erythrae]], [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]], together with [[Samos]] and [[Chios]].<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D142 1.142].</ref> [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]], originally an [[Aeolis|Aeolic]] colony, was afterwards occupied by Ionians from Colophon, and became an Ionian city \u2014 an event which had taken place before the time of Herodotus.<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D143 1.143], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D149 1.149\u2013150].</ref>\n[[File:Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia.jpg|thumb|left|Art relics from the Ionian cities of Asia]]\nThese cities do not match those of [[Achaea]]. Moreover, the Achaea of Herodotus' time spoke [[Doric Greek|Doric]] (Corinthian), but in [[Homer]] it is portrayed as being in the kingdom of [[Mycenae]], which most likely spoke [[Mycenaean Greek]], which is not Doric. If the Ionians came from Achaea, they departed during or after the change from East Greek to West Greek there. Mycenaean continued to evolve in the mountainous region of [[Arcadia]].\n\nThere is no record of any people named Ionians in [[Bronze Age#Ancient Near East|Late Bronze Age]] Anatolia but [[Hittite texts]] record the Achaeans of [[Achaeans (Homer)#Hittite documents|Ahhiyawa]], of location not completely certain, but in touch with the Hittites of that time. [[Miletus]] and some other cities founded earlier by non-Greeks received populations of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] probably under the name of Achaeans. The tradition of Ionian colonizers from Achaea suggests that they may have been known by both names even then. In the absence of archaeological evidence of discontinuity at Miletus the Achaean population whatever their name appears to have descended to archaic Ionia, which does not exclude the possibility of another colonizing and founding event from Athens.\n\nIn the Indian (e.g.: Tamil) historic literary texts, the Ionians are referred to as [[Yona|\"yavana\" or \"yona\"]], and are described as wearing leather and wielding whips.\nIn modern Turkish, the people of that region and the Greeks were called \"yunan\" (plural \"yunanlar\") and the country that is now Greece is known as \"Yunanistan\".\n\nHerodotus expresses some impatience at the ethnic views of his countrymen concerning Ionia: \"for it would be foolishness to say that these are more truly Ionian or better born ....\"<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D146 1.146].</ref> He lists other ethnic populations among the settlers: Abantes from [[Euboea]], [[Minyans]] from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], Cadmeians, [[Dryopia]]ns, [[Phocis|Phocians]], [[Molossians]], Arcadian [[Pelasgians]], [[Dorians]] of [[Epidaurus]], and others. The presence of Doric Ionians is somewhat contradictory, but Herodotus himself, a major author of the Ionic dialect, was from a Doric city, [[Halicarnassus]]. Even \" the best born of the Ionians\", the Athenians, married girls from [[Caria]]. \"Yet since they set more store by the name than the rest of the Ionians, let it be granted that those of pure birth are Ionians.\"<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D147 1.147].</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Western Asia Minor Greek Colonization.svg|230px|right|thumb|Greek settlements in western [[Asia Minor]], Ionian area in green.]]\nFrom the 18th century BC the region was a part of the [[Hittite Empire]] with possible name [[Arzawa]], which was destroyed by invaders during the 12th century BC together with the collapse of the Empire. Ionia was settled by the Greeks probably during the 11th century BC. The most important city was [[Miletus]] (the ''Millawanda/Milawata'' of Hittites).\nSeveral centuries later Ionia was the place where [[Western philosophy]] began and was the homeland of [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and [[Heraclitus]]. They were natural-philosophers of the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]] and tried to explain the phenomena according to non-supernatural laws. They also searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of things (origin) and this conception had a great influence on the early archaic art in Greece.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Main article|First Greek colonisation}}\nDuring the late 13th century BC the peoples of the [[Aegean Sea]] took to marauding and resettling as a way of life and were called by the Egyptians the [[Sea Peoples]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Mycenaean Greeks must have been among them. They settled lightly on the shores of [[Luwian]] Anatolia often by invitation. In the background was the stabilizing influence of the Hittites, who monitored maritime movement and suppressed piracy. When that power was gone the Luwian people remained in the vacuum as a number of coastal splinter states that were scarcely able now to defend themselves. Ionian Greeks took advantage of opportunities for coastal raiding: an inscription of [[Sargon II]] (ca 709\u201307, recording a naval expedition of 715) boasts \"in the midst of the sea\" he had \"caught the Ionians like fish and brought peace to the land of Que [[Cilicia]] and the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]\".<ref name=\"Fox 2008\">Sargon's inscription in A. Fuchs, ''Die Inschriften Sargons II aus Khorsabad'' (1994:40) noted in Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:29f.</ref> For a full generation earlier Assyrian inscriptions had recorded troubles with the Ionians, who escaped on their boats.<ref name=\"Fox 2008\" />\n\n[[Caria]] and [[Lycia]] came to the attention of [[Athens]], most powerful state remaining in Greece, which also had lost its central government ruling from [[Mycenae]], now burned and nearly vacant. Ionians had been expelled from the [[Peloponnesus]] by the [[Dorians]] and had sought refuge in Athens. The Athenian kings decided to relieve the crowding by resettling the coast of Lydia with Ionians from the Peloponnesus under native Athenian leadership.\n\n[[File:Miletus Northern Agora.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The site of [[Miletus]], once coastal, now inland. The plain was a bay in [[Classical Greece]].]]\n\nThey were not the only Greeks to have such a perception and reach such a decision. The [[Aeolians]] of [[Boeotia]] contemporaneously settled the coast to the north of the Ionians and the newly arrived  [[Dorians]] of [[Crete]] and the islands the coast of [[Caria]]. The Greeks descended on the [[Luwians]] of the Anatolian coast in the 10th century BC. The descent was not peaceful and the Luwians were not willing.\n\n[[File:Ionia, placchetta in osso di gorgone in corsa con serpenti, 575-550 ac ca.jpg|thumb|upright|Gorgone with serpent, Ionia, 575-550 BC.]]\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] gives a thumbnail sketch of the resettlement.<ref>''Guide to Greece'' Book 7 Sections 5\u20137.</ref> [[Miletus]] was the first city attacked, where there had been some Mycenaean Greeks apparently under the rule of [[Crete|Cretans]]. After overthrowing the Cretan government and settling there the Ionians widened their attack to [[Ephesus]], [[Samos]] and [[Priene]]. Combining with [[Aeolians]] from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] they founded [[Myus]]. [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] was already in the hands of Aeolians who had arrived via Crete in Mycenaean times. The Ionians \"swore a treaty of union\" with them. They took [[Lebedos]] driving out the Carians and augmented the Aeolian population of [[Teos]]. They settled on [[Chios]], took [[Erythrae]] from the Carians, Pamphylians (both Luwian) and Cretans. [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]] were settled from [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Somewhat later they took [[Smyrna]] from the Aeolians.\n\n===Brief autonomy===\n{{main|Ionian League|Panionium|Delos}}\nThe Ionian cities formed a religious and cultural (as opposed to a political or military) confederacy, the [[Ionian League]], of which participation in the [[Panionia|Panionic festival]] was a distinguishing characteristic. This festival took place on the north slope of [[Mt. Mycale]] in a shrine called the [[Panionium]]. In addition to the Panionic festival at Mycale, which was celebrated mainly by the Asian Ionians, both European and Asian coast Ionians convened on [[Delos]] Island each summer to worship at the temple of the Delian [[Apollo]].\n\nBut like the [[Amphictyonic league]] in Greece, the Ionic was rather of a sacred than a political character; every city enjoyed absolute autonomy, and, though common interests often united them for a common political object, they never formed a real confederacy like that of the Achaeans or [[Boeotia]]ns. The advice of [[Thales]] of Miletus to combine in a political union was rejected.\n\nThe colonies naturally became prosperous. [[Miletus]] especially was at an early period one of the most important commercial cities of Greece; and in its turn became the parent of numerous other colonies, which extended all around the shores of the [[Euxine Sea]] and the Propontis from Abydus and [[Cyzicus]] to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] and Panticapaeum. [[Phocaea]] was one of the first Greek cities whose mariners explored the shores of the western Mediterranean. [[Ephesus]], though it did not send out any colonies of importance, from an early period became a flourishing city and attained to a position corresponding in some measure to that of Smyrna at the present day.\n\n===Under the last Anatolian empire===\n[[File:IONIA, Uncertain. Circa 600-550 BC.jpg|thumb|Possible coin of Ionia. Circa 600-550 BC]]\nAbout 700 BC [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], first Mermnad king of [[Lydia]], invaded the territories of Smyrna and Miletus, and is said to have taken [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] as his son Ardys did Priene. The first event in the history of Ionia for which there is a trustworthy account is the inroad of the [[Cimmerians|Cimmerii]], who ravaged a great part of Asia Minor, including Lydia, and sacked [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], but were foiled in their attack upon Ephesus. This event may be referred to the middle of the 7th century BC. It was not until the reign of [[Croesus]] (560\u2013545 BC) that the cities of Ionia fell completely under Lydian rule.\n\n===Satrapy of the Achaemenids===\n{{main|Ionia (satrapy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| image1   = Xerxes I tomb Ionian soldier circa 470 BCE cleaned up.jpg\n| width1   = 130\n| caption1 = <center>Ionian soldier of the Achaemenid army, circa 480 BCE.

In this position they enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy, but were for the most part subject to local despots, most of whom were creatures of the Persian king. It was at the instigation of one of these despots, [[Histiaeus of Miletus]], that in about 500 BC the principal cities ignited the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persia. They were at first assisted by the Athenians and [[Eretria]], with whose aid they penetrated into the interior and burnt Sardis, an event which ultimately led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian invasion of Greece]]. But the fleet of the Ionians was defeated off the island of [[Battle of Lade|Lade]], and the destruction of Miletus after a protracted siege was followed by the reconquest of all the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well as continental.\n\n===Autonomy under the Athenian empire===\nThe victories of the Greeks during the great Persian war and the liberation of [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]], and Ionia from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] had the effect of enfranchising their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegean; and the [[Battle of Mycale]] (479 BC), in which the defeat of the Persians was in great measure owing to the Ionians, secured their emancipation. They henceforth became the dependent allies of Athens (see [[Delian League]]), though still retaining their autonomy, which they preserved until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387 BC once more placed them as well as the other Greek cities in Asia under the nominal dominion of Persia.\n\n===Satrapy again (387-335 BC)===\n[[File:IONIA, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC.jpg|thumb|Ionia, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC]]\nIonian cities appear to have retained a considerable amount of freedom until the conquest of Asia Minor by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nAfter the [[battle of the Granicus]] most of the Ionian cities submitted to the rule of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] of [[Macedon]] and his [[Diadochi]]. As such Ionia enjoyed a great prosperity during the [[Hellenistic]] times with the notable exception of [[Miletus]], which, being the only city of the [[Ionian League]] to deny to pay homage to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], was finally leveled after a long siege at 334 [[Before Christ|BC]], and never restored to its previous splendor.\n\n===Under Rome===\nIonia became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 133 BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History |title=Ionia |first=Jan |last=Breder |date=26 October 2012 |isbn=9781405179355 |doi=10.1002/9781444338386 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]] |oclc=230191195}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIonia has a long roll of distinguished men of letters and science (notably the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] of philosophy) and distinct school of art. This school flourished between 700 and 500 BC. The great names of this school are [[Theodorus of Samos|Theodorus]] and Rhoecus of Samos; [[Bathycles of Magnesia|Bathycles]] of [[Magnesia on the Maeander]]; [[Glaucus of Chios]], Melas, Micciades, Archermus, [[Bupalus|Bupalus and Athenis]] of [[Chios]]. Notable works of the school still extant are the famous archaic female statues found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1885\u20131887, the seated statues of Branchidae, the Nike of Archermus found at Delos, and the objects in [[ivory]] and [[electrum]] found by D.G. Hogarth in the lower strata of the Artemision at Ephesus.\n\nThe [[Persian language|Persian]] designation for [[Greek language|Greek]] is ''Younan'' (\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646), a transliteration of \"Ionia\", through [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''Yauna''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindner|first1=Rudi Paul|title=Explorations in Ottoman Prehistory|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=978-0-47209-507-0|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JMUAfa3GFVQC&pg=PA19&dq=yunan+yauna#v=onepage&q=yunan%20yauna&f=false|quote=The name \"Yunan\" comes from Ionia; cf.

The film centers on Foster as he treks on foot across the city of [[Los Angeles]], trying to reach the house of his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday. Along the way, a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative, causes him to react with increasing violence and make sardonic observations on life, poverty, the economy, and commercialism. [[Robert Duvall]] co-stars as Martin Prendergast, an aging [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant on the day of his retirement, who faces his own frustrations - even as he tracks down Foster.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nWilliam Foster is living in Los Angeles. He is recently divorced (his ex-wife, Beth, has a restraining order against him) and has been fired from his job. After the air conditioning fails, he abandons his car in a [[traffic jam]] and begins walking. At a convenience store, the Korean owner, mistaking Foster for a thief, refuses to give change for a telephone call and takes out a baseball bat, which Foster wrestles from him and uses to destroy his merchandise after complaining about his high prices. He pays for a soda and leaves. Shortly thereafter, he is approached by gang members when trying to eat his lunch. After being harassed and threatened, one pulls out a knife. Foster fights them off with the bat and retrieves the knife. Meanwhile, Sergeant Martin Prendergast is on his last day of work before retirement. He takes a report from the Korean store owner, who describes the melee with Foster. \n\nFoster calls Beth from a phone booth. Despite her restraining order, he insists he will come home for his daughter, Adele's, birthday. The gang members, now in a car with reinforcements, find Foster. They attempt a [[drive by shooting]] with [[machine pistol]]s but miss him and hit several bystanders instead, before crashing the car. Foster approaches, shoots a trapped gangster in the leg and takes a duffel bag full of their weapons. In the meantime, Beth calls the police, but the officers do not believe that Foster is dangerous.\n\nAngela, the girlfriend of one of the gangsters, is interrogated by police, as she witnessed the drive-by shooting. She describes Foster and Prendergast connects the convenience store incident and the drive-by-shooting event. At a fast-food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a machine pistol and accidentally fires into the ceiling. Foster takes his food, complaining about the quality. After he leaves, he shoots down a phone booth after being insulted by an impatient man trying to make a call. Prendergast and his partner, Torres, begin to investigate Foster.\n\nFoster passes a bank in which an [[African American]] man is publicly protesting his rejected loan application, after which he is taken away by police. Foster then stops at a military surplus store. The owner, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], insults two homosexual customers and, when questioned by Torres, denies having seen Foster, who is hiding in a changing room. After Torres leaves, the owner congratulates Foster for the fast-food incident, believing the employees were all black, and offers him a [[M72 LAW|rocket launcher]]. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's bigotry, the store owner pulls a gun and attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him with the gang member's knife and shoots him dead. He changes into army fatigues and boots, and leaves with the rocket launcher and his bag of guns. Alarmed by his rambling speech and menacing manner from phone calls, Beth again calls the police, who arrive and stay briefly. \n\nFoster encounters a road-repair crew and accuses them of doing unnecessary construction work to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher, and, with the aid of a boy mistaking the incident for a movie, blows up the construction site.\n\nLater, Foster trespasses into private property and walks across a golf course. A golfer attempts to hit Foster with a golf ball but misses. Foster complains about the golfer's selfishness and shoots down a golf cart, prompting the golfer to have a heart attack. Further into the property, he reaches an extravagant house and complains to the caretaker he cut his hand with barbed wire. After he hears police sirens, Foster considers taking the caretaker and his family hostage by Foster, although he lets them go and flees. \n\nBeth flees with Adele after more phone calls. Shortly after Foster reaches the empty house, Prendergast and Torres arrive. Foster shoots and wounds Torres and rushes out to Venice Pier, with Prendergast chasing him. At the end of the pier, Foster finds Beth and Adele. Adele is happy to see him and Foster and hugs her, despite Beth's fear. Prendergast arrives and intervenes. Beth kicks away Foster's gun as Prendergast draws his revolver. He sympathizes with Foster's complaints about being ill-treated by society, but does not accept them as an excuse for his rampage and demands Foster surrender. Dispirited by the realization he is \"the bad guy\" of this story, Foster tells Prendergast he has a concealed handgun. He reaches and [[Suicide by cop|tricks Prendergast into shooting him]]: the gun was only a water pistol. Foster dies and falls off the pier into the water. After conversing with Beth and Adele, Prendergast decides to hold off retirement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as William \"D-Fens\" Foster \n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Sgt.

The film centers on Foster as he treks on foot across the city of [[Los Angeles]], trying to reach the house of his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday. Along the way, a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative, causes him to react with increasing violence and make sardonic observations on life, poverty, the economy, and commercialism. [[Robert Duvall]] co-stars as Martin Prendergast, an aging [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant on the day of his retirement, who faces his own frustrations - even as he tracks down Foster.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nWilliam Foster is living in Los Angeles. He is recently divorced (his ex-wife, Beth, has a restraining order against him) and has been fired from his job. After the air conditioning fails, he abandons his car in a [[traffic jam]] and begins walking. At a convenience store, the Korean owner, mistaking Foster for a thief, refuses to give change for a telephone call and takes out a baseball bat, which Foster wrestles from him and uses to destroy his merchandise after complaining about his high prices. He pays for a soda and leaves. Shortly thereafter, he is approached by gang members when trying to eat his lunch. After being harassed and threatened, one pulls out a knife. Foster fights them off with the bat and retrieves the knife. Meanwhile, Sergeant Martin Prendergast is on his last day of work before retirement. He takes a report from the Korean store owner, who describes the melee with Foster. \n\nFoster calls Beth from a phone booth. Despite her restraining order, he insists he will come home for his daughter, Adele's, birthday. The gang members, now in a car with reinforcements, find Foster. They attempt a [[drive by shooting]] with [[machine pistol]]s but miss him and hit several bystanders instead, before crashing the car. Foster approaches, shoots a trapped gangster in the leg and takes a duffel bag full of their weapons. In the meantime, Beth calls the police, but the officers do not believe that Foster is dangerous.\n\nAngela, the girlfriend of one of the gangsters, is interrogated by police, as she witnessed the drive-by shooting. She describes Foster and Prendergast connects the convenience store incident and the drive-by-shooting event. At a fast-food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a machine pistol and accidentally fires into the ceiling. Foster takes his food, complaining about the quality. After he leaves, he shoots down a phone booth after being insulted by an impatient man trying to make a call. Prendergast and his partner, Torres, begin to investigate Foster.\n\nFoster passes a bank in which an [[African American]] man is publicly protesting his rejected loan application, after which he is taken away by police. Foster then stops at a military surplus store. The owner, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], insults two homosexual customers and, when questioned by Torres, denies having seen Foster, who is hiding in a changing room. After Torres leaves, he congratulates Foster for the fast-food incident, believing the employees were all black, and offers Foster a [[M72 LAW|rocket launcher]]. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's bigotry, the store owner pulls a gun and attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him with the gang member's knife and shoots him dead. He changes into army fatigues and boots, and leaves with the rocket launcher and his bag of guns. Alarmed by his rambling speech and menacing manner from phone calls, Beth again calls the police, who arrive and stay briefly. \n\nFoster encounters a road-repair crew and accuses them of doing unnecessary construction work to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher, and, with the aid of a boy mistaking the incident for a movie, blows up the construction site.\n\nLater, Foster trespasses into private property and walks across a golf course. A golfer attempts to hit Foster with a golf ball but misses. Foster complains about the golfer's selfishness and shoots down a golf cart, prompting the golfer to have a heart attack. Further into the property, he reaches an extravagant house and complains to the caretaker he cut his hand with barbed wire. After he hears police sirens, Foster considers taking the caretaker and his family hostage by Foster, although he lets them go and flees. \n\nBeth flees with Adele after more phone calls. Shortly after Foster reaches the empty house, Prendergast and Torres arrive. Foster shoots and wounds Torres and rushes out to Venice Pier, with Prendergast chasing him. At the end of the pier, Foster finds Beth and Adele. Adele is happy to see him and Foster and hugs her, despite Beth's fear. Prendergast arrives and intervenes. Beth kicks away Foster's gun as Prendergast draws his revolver. He sympathizes with Foster's complaints about being ill-treated by society, but does not accept them as an excuse for his rampage and demands Foster surrender. Dispirited by the realization he is \"the bad guy\" of this story, Foster tells Prendergast he has a concealed handgun. He reaches and [[Suicide by cop|tricks Prendergast into shooting him]]: the gun was only a water pistol. Foster dies and falls off the pier into the water. After conversing with Beth and Adele, Prendergast decides to hold off retirement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as William \"D-Fens\" Foster \n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Sgt.

Both of these approaches represent a facile reading of the film, which is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant... What is fascinating about the Douglas character, as written and played, is the core of sadness in his soul. Yes, by the time we meet him, he has gone over the edge. But there is no exhilaration in his rampage, no release. He seems weary and confused, and in his actions he unconsciously follows scripts that he may have learned from the movies, or on the news, where other frustrated misfits vent their rage on innocent bystanders.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Falling Down | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930226/REVIEWS/302260301/1023 | work=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=February 26, 1993 | accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' writer [[Hal Hinson]] observed:\n\n<blockquote>This guy is you, the movie suggests, and if not you exactly, then maybe the guy you're one or two bad breaks from becoming.

''\"I'm the bad guy?\"'' he asks in disbelief. Douglas speaks the line with a searing poignancy that illuminates uncomfortable truths without excusing the character.

Wolfe said \"Today, we might see D-Fens and the white supremacist as the infighting sides of the far right \u2014 one couches racism in coded words like \"thug,\" while the other wants an outright ethnic cleanse.

The Foo Fighters' song \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\" has a music video that is a recreation of scenes from ''Falling Down''. The Front Line Assembly album [[Millennium_(Front_Line_Assembly_album) | Millennium]] contains several samples from various scenes from ''Falling Down''.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Tony Hawk's American Wasteland]]'', a character resembling Foster recreates the rocket launcher scene in a [[cutscene]], blowing up a construction site before walking away with a duffel bag.\n\nFrank Grimes, a one-off character on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\" is modeled after Foster, having the same flat-top haircut and white shirt and briefcase.\n\nThe band Slipknot sampled the famous \"Freedom of Speech\" clip in two songs: some earlier versions of \"Gently\", and \"Interloper\".\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUwdBQAAQBAJ|title=Falling Down|last=Davies|first=Jude|date=2013-12-04|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=9781137363084|language=en}}\n* {{cite book|author=Frauley, Jon|date= 2010|chapter=Moral Transcendence and Symbolic Interaction in ''Falling Down''|title= Criminology, Deviance, and the Silver Screen: The Fictional Reality and the Criminological Imagination|location= New York|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IW3HAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0106856}}\n* {{tcmdb title|18370}}\n* {{Allmovie title|16651}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|falling_down}}\n* {{metacritic film|falling-down|Falling Down}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD5ofrSNDFA ''Falling Down'' Trailer]\n\n{{Joel Schumacher}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:British thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Edgar Award-winning works]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joel Schumacher]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Regency Enterprises films]]\n[[Category:StudioCanal films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:American vigilante films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard]]\n", "name_user": "NEDOCHAN", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Down"}
