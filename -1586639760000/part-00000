Most of Bacharach's and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by [[Dionne Warwick]], but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]].

Bacharach's career received a boost when singer [[Jerry Butler]] asked to record \"[[Make it Easy on Yourself]],\" and wanted him to direct the recording sessions.

Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits\" was largely ignored in the US but rose to #3 on the UK album charts, where his version of \"[[Trains and Boats and Planes]]\" had become a top 5 single. In 1967, Bacharach signed as an artist with A&M Records, recording a mix of new material and re-arrangements of his best-known songs.  He recorded for A&M until 1978.\n\nAlthough Bacharach's compositions are typically more complex than the average pop song, he has expressed surprise in the fact that many jazz musicians have sought inspiration from his works, saying \"I've sometimes felt that my songs are restrictive for a jazz artist. I was excited when [Stan] Getz did a whole album of my music\" (''What The World Needs Now: Stan Getz Plays The Burt Bacharach Songbook'', Verve, 1968).<ref name=\"jazz\" />\n\nHis songs were adapted by a few jazz artists of the time, such as [[Stan Getz]], [[Cal Tjader]], [[Grant Green]], and [[Wes Montgomery]]. The Bacharach/David composition \"[[My Little Red Book]]\", originally recorded by [[Manfred Mann]] for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'', has become a rock standard.<ref>{{cite book| author=Robin Platts| title=Burt Bacharach & Hal David: What the World Needs Now| year=2003| publisher=Collector's Guide Publishing| isbn=978-1-896522-77-7}}</ref>\n\nBacharach composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]],'' which included \"The Look of Love\", performed by Dusty Springfield, and the title song, an instrumental Top 40 single for Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The resulting soundtrack album is widely considered to be one of the finest engineered vinyl recordings of all time, and is much sought after by [[audiophile]] collectors.<ref>Burlinghame, Jon (2012), ''The Music of James Bond'', OUP, p. 68.</ref>\n\nBacharach and David also collaborated with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer [[David Merrick]] on the 1968 musical ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', which yielded two hits, including the title tune and \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]].\" Bacharach and David wrote the song when the producer realized the play urgently needed another before its opening the next evening. Bacharach, who had just been released from the hospital after contracting pneumonia, was still sick, but worked with David's lyrics to write the song which was performed for the show's opening. It was later recorded by Dionne Warwick and was on the charts for several weeks.<ref name=Lohof />{{rp|28}}\n\nThe year 1969 marked, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration, the Oscar-winning \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\", written for and prominently featured in the acclaimed film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''. The two were awarded a Grammy for Best Cast album of the year for \"Promises, Promises\" and the score was also nominated for a Tony award.\n\nOther Oscar nominations for Best Song in the latter half of the 1960s were for \"The Look Of Love\", \"[[What's New Pussycat?

The remake was a critical and commercial disaster and a flurry of [[lawsuits]] resulted between the composer and the lyricist, as well as from Warwick. She reportedly felt abandoned when Bacharach and David refused to work together further.\n\nBacharach tried several solo projects, including the 1977 album ''Futures'', but the projects failed to yield hits.  He and David reunited briefly in 1975 to write and produce other records.\n\n\nBy the early 1980s, Bacharach's marriage to [[Angie Dickinson]] had ended, but a new partnership with lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]] proved rewarding, both commercially and personally.

Guest stars on the album included [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and hip-hop producer [[Dr. Dre]].\n\nIn 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC [[BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms|Electric Proms]] at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]] in London, performing with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] accompanied by guest vocalists [[Adele]], [[Beth Rowley]] and [[Jamie Cullum]]. The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer [[Karima Ammar]] and produced her debut single ''Come In Ogni Ora'', which became a #4 hit.\n\nIn June, 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the [[Glastonbury Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mxj/acts/aj5mzc|title=Glastonbury 2015 - Burt Bacharach|website=BBC Music Events|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref> and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] to launch 'What's It All About?

Most of Bacharach's and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by [[Dionne Warwick]], but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]]. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach went on to write hits for [[Gene Pitney]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Jackie DeShannon]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Herb Alpert]], [[B.

Bacharach's career received a boost when singer [[Jerry Butler]] asked to record \"[[Make it Easy on Yourself]],\" and wanted him to direct the recording sessions.

Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits\" was largely ignored in the US but rose to #3 on the UK album charts, where his version of \"[[Trains and Boats and Planes]]\" had become a top 5 single. In 1967, Bacharach signed as an artist with A&M Records, recording a mix of new material and re-arrangements of his best-known songs.  He recorded for A&M until 1978.\n\nAlthough Bacharach's compositions are typically more complex than the average pop song, he has expressed surprise in the fact that many jazz musicians have sought inspiration from his works, saying \"I've sometimes felt that my songs are restrictive for a jazz artist. I was excited when [Stan] Getz did a whole album of my music\" (''What The World Needs Now: Stan Getz Plays The Burt Bacharach Songbook'', Verve, 1968).<ref name=\"jazz\" />\n\nHis songs were adapted by a few jazz artists of the time, such as [[Stan Getz]], [[Cal Tjader]], [[Grant Green]], and [[Wes Montgomery]]. The Bacharach/David composition \"[[My Little Red Book]]\", originally recorded by [[Manfred Mann]] for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'', has become a rock standard.<ref>{{cite book| author=Robin Platts| title=Burt Bacharach & Hal David: What the World Needs Now| year=2003| publisher=Collector's Guide Publishing| isbn=978-1-896522-77-7}}</ref>\n\nBacharach composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]],'' which included \"The Look of Love\", performed by Dusty Springfield, and the title song, an instrumental Top 40 single for Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The resulting soundtrack album is widely considered to be one of the finest engineered vinyl recordings of all time, and is much sought after by [[audiophile]] collectors.<ref>Burlinghame, Jon (2012), ''The Music of James Bond'', OUP, p. 68.</ref>\n\nBacharach and David also collaborated with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer [[David Merrick]] on the 1968 musical ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', which yielded two hits, including the title tune and \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]].\" Bacharach and David wrote the song when the producer realized the play urgently needed another before its opening the next evening. Bacharach, who had just been released from the hospital after contracting pneumonia, was still sick, but worked with David's lyrics to write the song which was performed for the show's opening. It was later recorded by Dionne Warwick and was on the charts for several weeks.<ref name=Lohof />{{rp|28}}\n\nThe year 1969 marked, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration, the Oscar-winning \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\", written for and prominently featured in the acclaimed film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''. The two were awarded a Grammy for Best Cast album of the year for \"Promises, Promises\" and the score was also nominated for a Tony award.\n\nOther Oscar nominations for Best Song in the latter half of the 1960s were for \"The Look Of Love\", \"[[What's New Pussycat?

He enjoyed a great deal of visibility in the public spotlight, appearing frequently on TV and performing live in concert. He starred in two televised musical extravaganzas: \"An Evening with Burt Bacharach\" and \"Another Evening with Burt Bacharach,\" both broadcast nationally on NBC.<ref name=Lohof>Lohof, Bruce.

The remake was a critical and commercial disaster and a flurry of [[lawsuits]] resulted between the composer and the lyricist, as well as from Warwick. She reportedly felt abandoned when Bacharach and David refused to work together further.\n\nBacharach tried several solo projects, including the 1977 album ''Futures'', but the projects failed to yield hits.  He and David reunited briefly in 1975 to write and produce other records.\n\n\nBy the early 1980s, Bacharach's marriage to [[Angie Dickinson]] had ended, but a new partnership with lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]] proved rewarding, both commercially and personally. The two married and collaborated on several major hits during the decade, including \"[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]\" ([[Christopher Cross]]), co-written with Cross and Peter Allen;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/18/22/397F876F00000578-3849144-image-m-22_1476824789502.jpg|title=Photo of Bacharach and Sager after they won the Oscar in 1982 for best song, \"Arthur's Theme\" for the film ''Arthur''|format=JPG|website=I.dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}} \"[[Heartlight (song)|Heartlight]]\" ([[Neil Diamond]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/neil-diamond-carole-bayer-sager-and-burt-bacharach-picture-id105918140|title=Photo of Neil Diamond with Sager and Bacharach in 1987|publisher=|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref> \"[[Making Love (song)|Making Love]]\" ([[Roberta Flack]]); \"[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]\" ([[Patti LaBelle]] with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]].)\n\nAnother of their hits, \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" in 1985, reunited Bacharach and Warwick. When asked about their coming together again, she explained:\n\n{{quote|We realized we were more than just friends. We were family.

Examples included Luther Vandross' recording of \"A House is Not a Home\"; [[Naked Eyes]]' 1983 pop hit version of \"[[(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me]]\", and [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s 1982 country version of \"[[Any Day Now (1962 song)|Any Day Now]]\". Bacharach continued a concert career, appearing at auditoriums throughout the world, often with large orchestras.

Bacharach's 2005 solo album ''[[At This Time]]'' was a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on the album included [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and hip-hop producer [[Dr. Dre]].\n\nIn 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC [[BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms|Electric Proms]] at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]] in London, performing with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] accompanied by guest vocalists [[Adele]], [[Beth Rowley]] and [[Jamie Cullum]]. The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer [[Karima Ammar]] and produced her debut single ''Come In Ogni Ora'', which became a #4 hit.\n\nIn June, 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the [[Glastonbury Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mxj/acts/aj5mzc|title=Glastonbury 2015 - Burt Bacharach|website=BBC Music Events|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref> and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] to launch 'What's It All About?

Bacharach and David did the score for an original musical for ABC-TV titled ''On the Flip Side'', broadcast on ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'', starring [[Ricky Nelson]] as a faded pop star trying for a comeback. While the ratings were dismal, the soundtrack showcased Bacharach's abilities to try different kinds of musical styles, ranging from (almost) 1960s rock, to pop, ballads, and Latin-tinged dance numbers.\n\nIn 1969, [[Harry Betts]] arranged Bacharach's instrumental composition \"Nikki\" (named for Bacharach's daughter) into a new theme for the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'', a television series that ran on the U.S. network until 1976.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several television commercials for [[Martini & Rossi]] beverages, and even penned a short jingle (\"Say Yes\") for the spots.
