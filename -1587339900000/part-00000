During [[Francoist Spain|Franco's]] 36-year dictatorship it only played two games. After Franco's death in 1975, the team was reformed using the name ''Euskadiko selekzioa'' and from the early 1990s began playing regular friendly matches, usually during [[La Liga]]'s Christmas break.

In 2008, a compromise was reached and it was changed again to ''Euskal selekzioa''. In the lower grades (youth and amateur), the team is either called ''Euskadiko selekzioa'' or ''Selecc\u00edon del Pa\u00eds Vasco'' and exclusively represents the Basque Country autonomous community (Euskadi), Navarre competing separately.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings, the North team (1913)===\nOn 29 September 1913 the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was formally created and along with it four regional federations (Norte, Oeste, Este and Centro).

As most of the biggest teams in the Norte federation were Basque, such as [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Uni\u00f3n]], and [[Arenas Club de Getxo]], so the team fielded by the federation was often composed entirely of Basque players, and was called 'Vasconia', 'el equipo Vasco'<ref>{{cite web|title=Mundo Deportivo newspaper, 21 December 1914 in Spanish|url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com/EMD02/HEM/1914/12/21/MD19141221-003.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>(the Basque team), or sometimes just 'Norte'.

At the heart of this dispute were the meanings of the two terms 'Euskadi' and 'Euskal Herria'. For the politicians of the PNV who favoured the name 'Euskadi', they saw this as the historic name used by the Basque football team since the 1930s and geographically they said it always included the Spanish Basque Country, the French Basque Country and Navarre (from where the players are selected), but to the players and the politicians supporting them, only the term 'Euskal Herria' had this geographic meaning and to them 'Euskadi' only referred to the Spanish Basque Country. This difference of opinion encompassed the nuances of the names, their history known or unknown, and changing public opinions towards what name should be used when referring to all people of Basque culture. In the end the match was cancelled.\n\nIn 2009 a consensus was reached to use the name 'Euskal Selekzioa'. However, discrepancies between the federation, players and [[Basque nationalism#Basque nationalist organizations|ESAIT]] led to the match, scheduled again to be played against Iran, not to be played.

It ranges from 5.5\u20138.5mm in size. The common color [[Form (zoology)|form]], f. ''succinea'', is orange or red in colouration with 0\u201322 black spots of variable size. The other usual forms, f. ''conspicua'' and f. ''spectabilis'', are uniformly black with, respectively, two or four red markings. The pronotum is white with variable black patterning, ranging from a few black spots in an M formation to almost entirely black. The underside is dark with a wide reddish-brown border.\n\nHowever, numerous other forms have also been recorded. Extreme forms may be entirely black, or feature complex patterns of black, orange and red.\n\nThe large size of this species is usually the first clue to its identification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harlequin-survey.org/recognition_and_distinction.htm|title=Harlequin Ladybird Survey - Recognition and Distinction|website=www.harlequin-survey.org|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bugguide.net/node/view/397|title=Species Harmonia axyridis - Multicolored Asian Lady Beetle - BugGuide.Net|website=bugguide.net|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref> Despite variation, this species does not generally overlap in pronotal or elytral pattern with any other species, except in unmarked orange or red forms. In Europe it is similar to the much smaller ''[[Adalia decempunctata]]'', while in America it is similar to the much narrower ''[[Mulsantina picta]]'' and spotless forms of ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]''. When identification is difficult, the underside pattern usually enables a reliable conclusion.<ref name=AD/> Identification is most simple for the common forms, while less common varieties may take longer to identify.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/predators/Harmonia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509181924/http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/predators/Harmonia.html |archive-date=2014-05-09 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> They always have reddish-brown legs and are obviously brown on the underside of the abdomen, even in the melanic colour forms.<ref name=Harlequinsurvey/>\n\n==Range==\n''Harmonia axyridis'' is native to eastern [[Asia]] from central [[Siberia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in the west, through [[Russia]] south to the [[Himalayas]] and east to the [[Pacific]] coast and [[Japan]], including [[Korea]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]], and [[Taiwan]]. As a voracious predator, it was identified as a [[biocontrol]] agent for [[aphid]]s and [[scale insect]]s. Consequently, it has been introduced into [[greenhouse]]s, [[crop]] fields, and [[garden]]s in many countries, including the [[United States]] and parts of [[Europe]]. The species is now established in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Israel]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], Slovakia, [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Poland]], and [[South Africa]].<ref name=Harlequinsurvey/>\n\n===North America===\n[[File:Malb1.jpg|right|240px|Typical ''H. axyridis'' specimen from northern California]]\nThis species became established in North America as the result of introductions into the United States in an attempt to control the spread of aphids. In the last three decades, this insect has spread throughout the US and Canada, and has been a prominent factor in controlling aphid populations. The first introductions into the US took place as far back as 1916. The species repeatedly failed to establish in the wild after successfully controlling aphid populations, but an established population of beetles was observed in the wild near [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], in about 1988. In the following years, it quickly spread to other states, being occasionally observed in the [[Midwest]] within five to seven years and becoming common in the region by about 2000.

The other usual forms, f. ''conspicua'' and f. ''spectabilis'', are uniformly black with, respectively, two or four red markings. The pronotum is white with variable black patterning, ranging from a few black spots in an M formation to almost entirely black. The underside is dark with a wide reddish-brown border.\n\nHowever, numerous other forms have also been recorded.

This beetle has good eyesight; it will return from a location to which it is removed, and is known to give a small bite if provoked.<ref>{{cite web|title=Multicolored Asian Ladybeetle (''Harmonia axyridis'')|url=http://www.pestid.msu.edu/InsectsArthropods/MulticoloredAsianLadybeetleHarmoniaaxyridis/tabid/253/Default.aspx|access-date=2010-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609093705/http://www.pestid.msu.edu/InsectsArthropods/MulticoloredAsianLadybeetleHarmoniaaxyridis/tabid/253/Default.aspx|archive-date=2010-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Harmonia axyridis'', like other ladybeetles or ladybirds, uses [[Methoxypyrazines|isopropyl methoxy pyrazine]] as a [[chemical defense|defensive chemical]] to deter predation, and also carries this chemical in its [[hemolymph]] at much higher concentrations than many other ladybeetle species, along with species-/genus-specific defensive compounds such as [[harmonine]]{{not a typo}}.

The easiest way to identify ''H. axyridis'' f. succinea is to look at the pronotum and see if the black markings look like a letter \"W\" or \"M\". This species has more white markings on the pronotum than have most native North American species, though this is not useful if not comparing it to North American species.\n\n<gallery widths=\"240\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:HarAxy ontwikkeling.jpg|Life cycle: [[mating]], [[egg (biology)|eggs]], five [[larva]]l stages, [[pupa]] and newly emerged adult\nFile:Harlequin ladybirds (Harmonia axyridis) mating 2.jpg|Mating\nFile:MIII8004.jpg|Three developmental stages\nFile:Harmonia axyridis - botanischer Garten Sch\u00f6nbrunn.jpg|Adult of ''Harmonia axyridis''\n</gallery>\n\n==Control==\nNumerous methods of control have been investigated in areas where this beetle has been introduced and causes a threat to native species and biodiversity and to the grape industry.

Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. The spezzino player [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]], injured, did not travel to Lisboa. The following persons in the Torino circle did not travel: second goalkeeper [[Renato Gandolfi]] (instead third  goalkeeper [[Dino Ballarin]] did), the radio anchor [[Nicol\u00f2 Carosio]] and former manager of Italian National Team also journalist Vittorio Pozzo (Torino preferred to give the seat to Cavallero).\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Jennings |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46788983 |title=The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWbGJPo1-c&source=video&vgc=rss&usg=AFQjCNFfzesVbEpVRJXx4KxoHr8LKgclPQ |title=TG-R \"Leonardo\": possibili cause della sciagura di Superga: l'ipotesi dell'altimetro guasto|publisher= Andrea Sinaglia YouTube }}</ref>\n\n====Legacy====\nThe impact of the tragedy in Italy was colossal. An official estimate of about one million persons attended funerals at Piazza in the city of Torino to say goodbye to the players and club officials. \nThe shock of the tragedy was the main reason for the long travel on boat across the Atlantic Ocean by Italian National Team to play the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil rather than use an airplane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/speciale/mondiali-verso-russia-2018/brasile-1950-la-seconda-squadra-un-uruguay-stellare-e-un-india-a-piedi-nudi_1214304-201802a.shtml|title=Brasile 1950, la seconda squadra: un Uruguay stellare e un'India a piedi...nudi|author=Andrea Saronni|date=18 May 2018}}</ref>\nRebuilding of Torino as a competitive squad lasted a long term and could not win another championship until 1976.\n\n==== List of victims ====\n;Players\n* [[Valerio Bacigalupo]]\n* [[Aldo Ballarin]]\n* [[Dino Ballarin]]\n* [[\u00c9mile Bongiorni]]\n* [[Eusebio Castigliano]]\n* [[Rubens Fadini]]\n* [[Guglielmo Gabetto]]\n* [[Ruggero Grava]]\n* [[Giuseppe Grezar]]\n* [[Ezio Loik]]\n* [[Virgilio Maroso]]\n* [[Danilo Martelli]]\n* [[Valentino Mazzola]](Captain)\n* [[Romeo Menti]]\n* [[Piero Operto]]\n* [[Franco Ossola]]\n* [[Mario Rigamonti]]\n* [[J\u00falius Schubert]]\n;Club officials\n* Arnaldo Agnisetta\n* Ippolito Civalleri\n* Andrea Bonaiuti (coordinator of team travels)\n;Managers\n* [[Egri Erbstein]]\n* [[Leslie Lievesley]]\n* Osvaldo Cortina (physical)\n;Journalists\n* [[Renato Casalbore]]\n* Renato Tosatti\n* Luigi Cavallero\n;Baggage Men\n* Pierluigi Meroni\n* Celeste D'Inca\n* Cesare Biancardi\n* Antonio Pangrazi\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Valerio Bacigalupo]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Dino Ballarin]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Renato Gandolfi]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Aldo Ballarin]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Virgilio Maroso]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Piero Operto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Rigamonti]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Biglino]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Eusebio Castigliano]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Rubens Fadini]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Luigi Giuliano]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Grezar]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Ezio Loik]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Danilo Martelli]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=CZE|name=[[J\u00falius Schubert]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Alfio Balbiano]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=FRA|name=[[\u00c9mile Bongiorni]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Guglielmo Gabetto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=FRA|name=[[Ruggero Grava]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Valentino Mazzola]]}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Romeo Menti]] II}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Franco Ossola]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Youth Squad ===\nAfter [[Superga air disaster]], youth squad (primavera)  disputed the last four round of the competition: they are not considered title winners due to Italian Federation (FIGC) actually assigned the championship to  the senior squad.\n\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Guido Vandone]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Bersia]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Lussu]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Mari]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Umberto Motto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Oscar Ferrari]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Gianmarinaro]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Lando Macchi]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Audisio]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Francone]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Marchetto]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n\n!

He was internationally renowned for his investigations on the [[neurophysiology|neural mechanisms]] underlying the phenomenon of electrogenesis by the [[electroplaques]] of [[electric fish]]es. He was also an important scientific leader, being one of the founders of the [[Instituto de Biof\u00edsica da Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro|Biophysics Institute]] of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] and was also a president for 16 years of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]'s [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and president of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] (1965&ndash;1967).\n\n==Life==\nHe was the second son of Dr. [[Carlos Chagas]] (1879&ndash;1934), an eminent scientist who is credited for the discovery of [[Chagas disease]]. His oldest brother was [[Evandro Chagas]] (1905&ndash;1940), also a physician and scientist specialized, like his father, in [[tropical medicine]].\n\nHe studied [[medicine]] from 1926 to 1931 at the [[Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Brasil]] (presently the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. While a student he worked at Manguinhos, where the [[Instituto Oswaldo Cruz]] was founded by the eminent physician Dr. [[Oswaldo Cruz]] (1872&ndash;1917) and where his father worked, as well as at a [[hospital]] in [[Lassance]], state of [[Minas Gerais]], where his father had discovered Chagas disease. After graduation, he went to become a director of this hospital during 1932. But what he really liked to do was biomedical research, following the example of his father and colleagues, so in the next years he worked with several leaders in the field of [[physiology]], such as [[Miguel Os\u00f3rio de Almeida]] (1890\u20131952) and [[Jos\u00e9 Carneiro Felippe]]. One year after graduation, he accepted a teaching post as assistant professor at the Medical School, in the chair of Biological Physics. With the death of its incumbent, Prof. [[Lafayette Rodrigues Pereira]], he became its chairman and full professor.\n\nFeeling the need to specialize further in neurophysiology, Dr. Chagas Filho travelled to [[France]], where he worked with [[Ren\u00e9 Wurmser]] and [[Alfred Fessard]], in [[Paris]], and to [[England]], where he worked with [[A.V. Hill]] (1886&ndash;1977). Returning to Brazil, he established a Laboratory of Biophysics at the Medical School and assembled a group of students and researchers. In 1945 he achieved the elevation of the Laboratory to the Biophysics Institute, which in a short time became one of the most important and excellent research centers in Brazil. He was its director for a long time, as well as the dean of the Medical School. The Institute presently bears his name. Dr. Carlos Chagas Filho retired in 1980, but continued to work steadfastly almost until his death, at 89 years of age.\n\n==Work==\nDr. Chagas Filho's main scientific contribution was centered on the study of the eletroplaques of the \"poraqu\u00ea\" or [[electric eel]] (''Electrophorus electricus''), actually a fresh water [[electric fish]] native to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]]. With his group, he made important and original advances in the elucidation of its [[anatomy]] and [[electrophysiology]], [[cytochemistry]], as well as its nervous control. He discovered the brain command structures which control electrical discharges. He discovered also that the electroplaques has two kinds of excitability, one which is direct, and another which is reflex via the nervous pathways. He studied also the effects of [[curare]] on the electroplaques, which are modified [[striated muscle]]s and thus have [[synapse|synaptic transmission]] based on [[acetylcholine]] (curare is an antagonist of this [[neurotransmitter]]). Dr. Chagas Filho also isolated the ACh [[membrane receptor]].\n\nAs an educator, Dr. Chagas Filho left a very important influence on biomedical research in Brazil, through his many scientific disciples and colleagues at the Biophysics Institute, many of whom went to become leaders themselves in neurophysiology, such as [[Hertha Meyer]], [[Hiss Martins Ferreira]], [[Eduardo Oswaldo Cruz Filho]], [[Ricardo Gattass]], [[Aristides Azevedo Pacheco Le\u00e3o]], [[Eduardo Penna Franca]], [[Gustavo de Oliveira Castro]], [[Darcy Fontoura de Almeida]], [[Antonio Paes de Carvalho]], [[Carlos Guinle da Rocha Miranda]], [[Romualdo Jos\u00e9 do Carmo]] and several others. It was during the initial years of the Institute, also, that [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] (1909-), then a young researcher of [[Jewish]] descent who had to escape [[fascism]], worked towards her important discoveries on [[neurotrophic factor]]s, supported by Carlos Chagas Filho. She later went to receive the Nobel Prize of Physiology and Medicine.\n\nHe published several books, including an autobiography, a biographical memoir about his father and more than 100 scientific papers.\n\n== Scientific leadership and honours ==\nDr. Chagas Filho played a significant role as international leader and representative of Brazilian science abroad. He was a Brazilian delegate and ambassador (1966) to [[UNESCO]] in Paris, and member of the Research Council of the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO), in [[Washington, DC]]. At the [[United Nations]] he was president of the Special Committee for the Application of Science and Technology to Development. Together with [[Nobel Prize]] winner, physicist [[Abdus Salam]] (1926&ndash;1996), he founded the [[International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Sciences]] (IFIAS).\n\nIn 1972, he was appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]] to the presidency of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], which he occupied until 1989. During his tenure, he was distinguished with the historical task of rehabilitating [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and with coordinating a study of the historical and scientific validity of the [[Turin shroud]]. He was deeply religious and sought to reconcile science and religion as best as possible. Thus, he led the Academy of Sciences through a number of important meetings and publications, examining controversial issues such as the [[brain]] and [[conscience]], and attracting great scientific personalities to the Academy, including a number of Nobel awardees.\n\nIn Brazil he was a member, vice-president and president of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] (1941&ndash;2000) and member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]] (1974&ndash;2000), a member of the [[Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico|National Research Council]] and one of the founders and member of the [[Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ci\u00eancia|Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science]].\n\nCarlos Chagas Filho was awarded with 16 titles of [[Honoris Causa]] Doctor in many national and foreign universities, and 19 [[state decoration|decoration]]s, including that of [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] (1979) and the [[Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit]]. He was a member of the French [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] and [[Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine]], [[Academia das Ci\u00eancias de Lisboa]], [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[American Philosophical Academy]], [[Royal Academy of Belgium]], [[Romanian Academy of Sciences]] and the International Academy of the History of Sciences.\n\nAmong his many scientific awards, he received the Moinho Santista Science Prize (1960); the Pr\u00eamio \u00c1lvaro Alberto para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (1988); and the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]], by the Fondation [[Simone Del Duca|Simone]] et [[Cino Del Duca]], France (1989).\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Chagas Filho, C.
