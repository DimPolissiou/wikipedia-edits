Introduced in the 1950 film ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and performed by actress [[Verna Felton]], the song is about the [[Fairy Godmother (Disney)|Fairy Godmother]] transforming an orange pumpkin into a white carriage, four brown mice into white horses, a gray horse into a white-haired coachman, and a brown dog into a white-haired footman. The song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1950s|Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in [[23rd Academy Awards|1951]] but lost out to \"[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\" from ''[[Captain Carey, U.S.A.]]'' Disney used the song once again in their [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 remake of ''Cinderella'']] which starred [[Lily James]] in the leading role. The song was performed by [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who plays Fairy Godmother, and was the final song of the movie, playing with the end credits.

It was recorded on November 7, 1949 and released by [[RCA Victor Records]] as a 78 rpm single (catalog number 20-3607-B) and as a 45rpm single (catalog number 47-3113-B).

The record first reached the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts on December 16, 1949 and lasted 7 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 19.

It is currently in the compilation of 1992 [[Sony Music]] (Legacy label) album \"Zip A Dee Doo Dah\".\n\nThis song was used in a [[Gatorade]] commercial starring [[Sergio Ramos]], [[Leo Messi]], [[David Luiz]], and [[Landon Donovan]] promoting the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe first line of the lyric was used as a [[mantra]] by [[Nellie McKay]] in a Guy Noir skit during episode 1482, January 24, 2015, of [[A Prairie Home Companion]].\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe lyrics of the song, as with the title, are composed nearly entirely of nonsense. The Cinderella [[LP record|LP]] insert lists the lyrics as follows:\n\n<poem>\nSala-gadoola-menchicka-boo-la bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\nPut 'em together and what have you got?\nBibbidi-bobbidi-boo\n\nSala-gadoola-menchicka-boo-la bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\nIt'll do magic believe it or not\nBibbidi-bobbidi-boo.\n\nNow, Sala-gadoola means menchicka-boolaroo\nBut the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job is\nbibbidi-bobbidi-boo.\n\nSala-gadoola-menchicka-boo-la bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\nPut 'em together and what have you got?\nBibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.\n</poem>\n\nThe 1949 recording, however, has several extra English lines that were not used in the 1950 Disney version, including: \"If your mind is in a dither, and your heart is in a haze, I'll haze your dither, and dither your haze, with a magic phrase\", and \"if you're chased around by trouble, and followed by a jinx, I'll jinx your trouble, and trouble your jinx, in less than forty winks.\" The tempo of the various recordings also differs widely.\n\n==Origins==\nIt has been{{when|date=December 2019}} suggested{{by who|date=December 2019}} that the phrase \"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\" can be traced to a short story by the Russian writer [[Ivan Turgenev]]. This is not, however, the case.<ref>The writer and editor [[Marvin Kaye]] adapted a Turgenev short story, and his adaptation, copyrighted 1975, appeared in English as \"Bubnoff and the Devil\". Kaye's adaptation was reprinted in ''Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural'', Doubleday, Garden City, New York, 1985, Marvin Kaye and Saralee Kaye, eds., at 24-30. In Kaye's adaptation, the character of the Devil\u2019s granddaughter is called \"Bibbidibobbidibu.\" But Kaye borrowed that name from the song. In Russian, the character\u2019s name is simply \"Babebibobu\" (in Cyrillic characters, \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0431\u0443). A Russian version of the story is available online at http://rvb.ru/turgenev/01text/vol_01/04unpublished/0100.htm. And in an English translation of the story that predates the Disney movie and the song, the character\u2019s name is \"Babebibobu.\" See \"The Adventure of Second Lieutenant Bubnov,\" in ''The Evening Standard Second Book of Strange Stories'', Hutchinson, London, 1937, at 375.</ref>\n\nThe song's melody resembles \"[[Hello! Ma Baby]]\", a [[Tin Pan Alley]] song from 1899. Five years after ''Cinderella'', \"Hello! Ma Baby\" was popularized in animation by ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'', with [[Warner Bros.]] having acquired its rights in 1929.\n\n==Covers==\nIn 1955, [[Jack Pleis]] recorded it for his album, ''Music from Disneyland''.\n\nIn the Disney/[[Square Enix]] crossover game ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', the song has been reorchestrated by [[Yoko Shimomura]] as the theme tune for the Cinderella world Castle of Dreams.\n\nIn 1975, [[Bando Da Lua]] recorded it for the album, ''Bando Da Lua Nos E.U.A''.\n\nIn 1980 [[Mino Reitano]] and [[Luca Chinnici]] recorded it (in Italian) for the album ''[[Ciao amico]]'' (Hello friend) with Italian text by [[Devilli]]. \n\nOn the 2012 album ''Disney - Koe no Oujisama'', which features various [[Voice acting in Japan|Japanese voice actors]] covering Disney songs, this song was covered by [[Jun Fukuyama]].\n\nOn ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', a similar sounding tune is heard sometimes such as when Squidward was playing a piece on his clarinet that incorporates a similar sounding tune as seen on the episode, \"Squid Wood\".\n\nOn ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Jafar and Iago help Mickey and friends bring the clubhouse back after Daisy accidentally made it disappear by doing a rap version of Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo as seen from the episode, \"House of Magic\".\n\n[[Helena Bonham Carter]], who plays the Fairy Godmother in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Disney 2015 film remake]], recorded the song for the film's soundtrack.\n\n==Parodies and puns==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\n[[Akira Toriyama]] named three characters in his ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series after this song: the evil wizard Bibbidi, his son [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Bobbidi|Bobbidi]], and Bibbidi's powerful creation [[Majin Buu|Djinn-Boo]]. However, these names are spelt as \"Bididi\", \"Babidi\", and \"Majin Buu\" respectively, in the English dub of the animated adaption.<ref name=\"ANN8review\">{{cite web |first= Martin|last= Theron|title= Dragon Ball Z Season 8 DVD Set - Review|url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-8|publisher= Anime News Network|date= 2008-06-16|accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> Also, two characters of the arcade game [[Dragon Ball Heroes]] are also named after the song: the Majin Hero Salaga and the demon Mechickaboola.\n\nThe song is parodied on the ''[[Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain]]'' episode \"Narfily Ever After\", a parody of ''Cinderella''.\n\nA parody version recorded by Mickey Katz is entitled \"The Baby, the Bubbe, and You\".\n\nThe lyrics of the song are algebraically analyzed in a math lesson by Mr. Garrison in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Royal Pudding]]\".\n\nThe title of the song is sung several times in [[Buck-Tick]]'s song \"Django!!! -Genwaku no Django-\" from their album ''[[Razzle Dazzle (album)|Razzle Dazzle]]''.\n\nThis phrase is often referenced in other Disney stories, mostly when magic is being used. For example, in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', and also in the [[Hercules (1998 TV series)|''Hercules'' TV series]], in the '[[List of Hercules (1998 TV series) episodes#Disney's One Saturday Morning|One Saturday Morning episodes]],' Episode 12: \"Hercules and the Gorgon.\"\n\nThe popular radio show ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' episode which aired on July 27, 1950, makes fun of the nonsense words of this song. The title of the episode is \"Liz Writes A Song\".\n\nThe film ''[[Shrek 2]]'' features a parody of the song, sung by Fiona's fairy godmother.\n\n''[[The Tim Conway Jr. Show]]'', on [[KFI]] Radio in [[Los Angeles]], California, sometimes plays a version of the song in which the singer is interrupted by an Angry Doug Steckler who criticizes the song's math skills.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Non-lexical vocables in music]]\n*[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Perry Como}}\n{{The Fontane Sisters}}\n{{Disney's Cinderella}}\n{{Cinderella}}\n\n[[Category:Cinderella (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Disney songs]]\n[[Category:Jo Stafford songs]]\n[[Category:Perry Como songs]]\n[[Category:The Fontane Sisters songs]]\n[[Category:Songs based on fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Songs with lyrics by Mack David]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Al Hoffman]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Jerry Livingston]]\n[[Category:Songs written for films]]\n[[Category:1948 songs]]\n[[Category:1949 singles]]\n", "text_old": "'''\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\"''' (also called \"The Magic Song\")<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Cinderella (1950 film)#Soundtrack|Cinderella: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack]]|year=2012|others=Various Artists|type=[[Compact disc|CD]] [[Liner notes|Liner booklet]]|publisher=[[Walt Disney Records]]|id=D001825700|page=4}}</ref> is a [[novelty song]], written in 1948 by [[Al Hoffman]], [[Mack David]], and [[Jerry Livingston]].

The new quartet sought a new name to make a fresh start. Linn was reported to have said: \"No one could pronounce the name of the group and nobody could remember it.\" They settled on Ace of Base after Ulf was inspired by the music video for the [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] song \"[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]\".<ref name=\"Ulf2016\">{{cite web|url=http://euromentravel.com/culture/popculture/ulf-ekberg-ace-of-base-interview|title=Ulf Ekberg (Ace of Base): The Interview|date=7 April 2016|publisher=EuroMenTravel|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the band continued to struggle to gain recognition, partly due to the preference of heavy metal over techno in their hometown, according to singer Jenny.<ref>Happy Nation Home Video, VHS, 1997</ref> In 1991 they responded to a newspaper ad by producer John Ballard, who was looking for new talent. He was somewhat unsure about their potential, but did pass them on to Klas Lunding at Telegram Records, who helped them record an early demo for the song \"[[Wheel of Fortune (Ace of Base song)|Wheel of Fortune]]\" in their newly renovated studio. A Jamaican reggae band resided in a studio next door to theirs, leading to a collaboration of ideas.<ref name=\"Ulf2016\" /> This resulted in a fusion of reggae with pop which became the band's trademark sound. \"Wheel of Fortune\" did not convince Telegram to sign the band, and other labels in Sweden still showed no sign of interest.

Keen rushed out an [[LP album|LP]] for the Christmas market, [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]] pressed the band for an album and it was hastily recorded, mixed and released within a few weeks.\n\nThe album, ''[[Happy Nation]]'', was an instant hit in [[Denmark]], and its success prompted interest elsewhere in Europe. A Pan-European license was signed with [[PolyGram|Metronome/PolyGram]] (now [[Universal Music]]), but they were turned down by the American division. Within a few months, \"All That She Wants\" had reached No. 3 in Sweden and had spent eight weeks at No. 1 in Germany. In various European countries, \"[[Happy Nation (song)|Happy Nation]]\" and \"[[Waiting for Magic]]\" were released as further singles following the release of the album.\n\nIn May, \"All That She Wants\" continued to be a hit all around the world and topped the chart for three weeks in the United Kingdom. In November 1993 it repeated the feat in Australia, where it also peaked at No. 1 for three weeks. However, despite [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]]'s hard efforts to secure a distribution deal in the United States, the response was always the same: \"This band will never work in the States.\" Eventually, however, [[Clive Davis]], founder of [[Arista Records]], thought otherwise, and by the end of 1993 \"All That She Wants\" had made its way to No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States.\n\nIn order to freshen up the album for American release, Davis insisted that some new tracks be recorded, including \"[[The Sign (Ace of Base song)|The Sign]]\", which became the new title track for the album and the second American single. It was even more successful than the first, spending six weeks at No. 1 and becoming the best-selling single of 1994. It was also a major hit in Europe, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and Sweden and at No. 1 in Germany; in Australia, \"The Sign\" spent the entire month of May in the No. 1 position, becoming the country's fifth highest-selling single of 1994.\n\nDue to fears of imports from the United States, the original European album was re-released with new tracks under the name ''[[Happy Nation (US Version)]]''. This was the first version of the album to chart in Australia, in April 1994. Collectively, the different versions of the album reached the No. 1 position in at least 14 countries.\n\nTwo more singles were released: \"[[Don't Turn Around]]\" and \"[[Living in Danger]]\". The former was originally recorded by [[Tina Turner]], as the B-side of her single \"[[Typical Male]]\". Davis suggested that the band record the song and it was yet another worldwide hit. The latter was a moderate chart hit in most countries where it was released, and was performed at the first ever MTV Europe Music Awards held in Germany. By the end of 1994, they were a worldwide commercial success.\n\n===''The Bridge'' (1995\u201396)===\n{{Main|The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|l1=The Bridge}}\nIn April 1994, an obsessed German fan broke into the Berggren family home, brandishing a knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=98&artikel=6119019|title=Ace of Base-stj\u00e4rnan om glamourens baksida|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> After managing to restrain her, the band decided they needed bodyguards. However, they were unable to take time to reflect before starting work on a second album because their record companies all over the world were demanding a swift follow-up. To speed up the process, instead of Jonas and Ulf writing the bulk of the album, each member was encouraged to submit their own tracks for consideration.<ref name=\"ourstory\"/>\n\nIn the end, 17 tracks made the cut of the second album, titled ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]''. It marked a considerable change of direction in sound; out were the reggae and club sounds that made the group so popular in favor of a more experimental sound and several ballads. The lead single, \"[[Lucky Love]]\", however, was a mainstream pop record, and upon its release in October 1995, it became the band's first No. 1 single in Sweden. This came as a pleasant surprise to the members, as they had found that their fellow Swedes had been their harshest critics. It charted at a more modest No. 13 in Germany, No. 20 in the United Kingdom and No. 30 in Australia.\n\nArista Records instead opted for the pulsating dance beat of \"[[Beautiful Life (Ace of Base song)|Beautiful Life]]\" for the first single in the US, where it peaked at No. 15. \"Beautiful Life\" was released as the second single from the album in most countries, reaching No. 15 in the UK and No. 11 in Australia, while \"Lucky Love\" was remixed in a new acoustic form along with a new video for the second US single from the album, peaking at No. 30. ''The Bridge'' was certified platinum in 14 countries, but the phenomenal success of the band's first album proved difficult to follow. \"[[Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry]]\" was released as the third single from the album and achieved moderate success in Europe, but it failed to chart on the Hot 100 in the US. In February 1996, the band performed at the [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile|Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] Festival de la Cancion in Chile, topping the bill alongside [[2 Unlimited]].\n\n===''Flowers'' / ''Cruel Summer'' (1997\u201399)===\n{{Main|Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|l1=Flowers|l2=Cruel Summer}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Ace_Of_Base-Flowers.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ace_Of_Base-Cruel_Summer.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Linn's image was blurred on the cover art of ''[[Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Flowers]]'' and ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]''.\n}} After this, Ace of Base disappeared from the limelight for a while, emerging only in April 1997 for a performance at the World Music Awards and in July 1997 to perform at a concert to celebrate the 20th birthday of [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]] of Sweden. They were given as much time as they wanted to produce their third album, much of it being recorded in Jonas's own studio, \"The Barn\". When it finally was released in June 1998, the band declared it their best album yet. It was titled ''[[Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Flowers]]'' because they believed that the songs, wildly different in style including [[Motown]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] influences, resembled a varied bouquet of flowers. Fans were surprised to see that singer Linn had relinquished lead vocal duties to sister Jenny, and on many promotional photos, Linn's face was blurred.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=[[Platinum & Gold Collection (Ace of Base album)|Platinum & Gold Collection]] |date=6 May 2003 |first=Bill |last=Pitzonka |type=Compact disc booklet |publisher=[[Arista Records|Arista]]}}</ref> They were reassured that Linn was happy with her new backing role in the group, and many reasons were given for her decision, including her having damaged her voice, fear of flying putting her off from traveling around the world and her dislike of fame.<ref name=\"ourstory\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=Linn has relinquished the role of front vocalist and delegated her singing duties to sister Jenny.

British label [[London Records]] had requested the band record the 1983 hit \"[[Cruel Summer (song)|Cruel Summer]]\", by [[Bananarama]] and it was selected as the second European single. Deciding that \"Life Is a Flower\" was \"too European in nature\", Clive Davis pushed \"Cruel Summer\" as the lead-off single for the United States, and it brought Ace of Base back into the US Top 10 for the first time in four years, being certified gold. The album was also renamed ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'' and featured a different track list compared to the European release. For this version of the album, Davis persuaded a reluctant Linn to record the Billy Steinberg-penned ballad \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\". \"Life Is a Flower\" was re-recorded as \"[[Whenever You're Near Me]]\" and four other songs originally on ''Flowers'' were remixed and edited for the U.S. release. \"Whenever You're Near Me\" was released as the second single from ''Cruel Summer,'' peaking at No. 76. \"[[Travel to Romantis]]\" and \"[[Always Have Always Will|Always Have, Always Will]]\" were further singles in Europe while \"Everytime It Rains\" was issued as a single in the UK along with a repackaged edition of ''Flowers'' released only in the UK.\n\n===''Singles of the 90s'' and ''Greatest Hits'' (1999\u20132000)===\n''[[Singles of the 90s]]'', a compilation of sixteen hit singles, was released in November 1999. Its first single, \"[[C'est La Vie (Always 21)]]\", charted modestly in most places where it was released and went on to become a surprise No. 1 hit in Spain. Attempting to capitalize on the success of the previous single, \"[[Hallo Hallo (Ace of Base song)|Hallo Hallo]]\" was released with special remixes just for the Spanish market. The album's marketing push closed with the limited radio-only single release of \"[[Love in December]]\". ''[[Greatest Hits (2000 Ace of Base album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was released for the American market in March 2000. \"Hallo Hallo\" initially was planned to be the first single from the compilation, but in the end, it was not included at all. \"C'est La Vie (Always 21)\" served as the only new recording on the American release. \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\", previously included on the ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'' album, was released in a new remixed form as a radio single in the US, becoming the only form of promotion for ''Greatest Hits''.

He was somewhat unsure about their potential, but did pass them on to Klas Lunding at Telegram Records, who helped them record an early demo for the song \"[[Wheel of Fortune (Ace of Base song)|Wheel of Fortune]]\" in their newly renovated studio. A Jamaican reggae band resided in a studio next door to theirs, leading to a collaboration of ideas.<ref name=\"Ulf2016\" /> This resulted in a fusion of reggae with pop which became the band's trademark sound. \"Wheel of Fortune\" did not convince Telegram to sign the band, and other labels in Sweden still showed no sign of interest.

Keen rushed out an [[LP album|LP]] for the Christmas market, [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]] pressed the band for an album and it was hastily recorded, mixed and released within a few weeks.\n\nThe album, ''[[Happy Nation]]'', was an instant hit in [[Denmark]], and its success prompted interest elsewhere in Europe. A Pan-European license was signed with [[PolyGram|Metronome/PolyGram]] (now [[Universal Music]]), but they were turned down by the American division. Within a few months, \"All That She Wants\" had reached No. 3 in Sweden and had spent eight weeks at No. 1 in Germany. In various European countries, \"[[Happy Nation (song)|Happy Nation]]\" and \"[[Waiting for Magic]]\" were released as further singles following the release of the album.\n\nIn May, \"All That She Wants\" continued to be a hit all around the world and topped the chart for three weeks in the United Kingdom. In November 1993 it repeated the feat in Australia, where it also peaked at No. 1 for three weeks. However, despite [[Edel-Mega Records|Mega Records]]'s hard efforts to secure a distribution deal in the United States, the response was always the same: \"This band will never work in the States.\" Eventually, however, [[Clive Davis]], founder of [[Arista Records]], thought otherwise, and by the end of 1993 \"All That She Wants\" had made its way to No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States.\n\nIn order to freshen up the album for American release, Davis insisted that some new tracks be recorded, including \"[[The Sign (Ace of Base song)|The Sign]]\", which became the new title track for the album and the second American single. It was even more successful than the first, spending six weeks at No. 1 and becoming the best-selling single of 1994. It was also a major hit in Europe, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and Sweden and at No. 1 in Germany; in Australia, \"The Sign\" spent the entire month of May in the No. 1 position, becoming the country's fifth highest-selling single of 1994.\n\nDue to fears of imports from the United States, the original European album was re-released with new tracks under the name ''[[Happy Nation (US Version)]]''. This was the first version of the album to chart in Australia, in April 1994. Collectively, the different versions of the album reached the No. 1 position in at least 14 countries.\n\nTwo more singles were released: \"[[Don't Turn Around]]\" and \"[[Living in Danger]]\". The former was originally recorded by [[Tina Turner]], as the B-side of her single \"[[Typical Male]]\". Davis suggested that the band record the song and it was yet another worldwide hit. The latter was a moderate chart hit in most countries where it was released, and was performed at the first ever MTV Europe Music Awards held in Germany. By the end of 1994, they were a worldwide commercial success.\n\n===''The Bridge'' (1995\u201396)===\n{{Main|The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|l1=The Bridge}}\nIn April 1994, an obsessed German fan broke into the Berggren family home, brandishing a knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=98&artikel=6119019|title=Ace of Base-stj\u00e4rnan om glamourens baksida|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> After managing to restrain her, the band decided they needed bodyguards. However, they were unable to take time to reflect before starting work on a second album because their record companies all over the world were demanding a swift follow-up. To speed up the process, instead of Jonas and Ulf writing the bulk of the album, each member was encouraged to submit their own tracks for consideration.<ref name=\"ourstory\"/>\n\nIn the end, 17 tracks made the cut of the second album, titled ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]''. It marked a considerable change of direction in sound; out were the reggae and club sounds that made the group so popular in favor of a more experimental sound and several ballads. The lead single, \"[[Lucky Love]]\", however, was a mainstream pop record, and upon its release in October 1995, it became the band's first No. 1 single in Sweden. This came as a pleasant surprise to the members, as they had found that their fellow Swedes had been their harshest critics. It charted at a more modest No. 13 in Germany, No. 20 in the United Kingdom and No. 30 in Australia.\n\nArista Records instead opted for the pulsating dance beat of \"[[Beautiful Life (Ace of Base song)|Beautiful Life]]\" for the first single in the US, where it peaked at No. 15. \"Beautiful Life\" was released as the second single from the album in most countries, reaching No. 15 in the UK and No. 11 in Australia, while \"Lucky Love\" was remixed in a new acoustic form along with a new video for the second US single from the album, peaking at No. 30. ''The Bridge'' was certified platinum in 14 countries, but the phenomenal success of the band's first album proved difficult to follow. \"[[Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry]]\" was released as the third single from the album and achieved moderate success in Europe, but it failed to chart on the Hot 100 in the US. In February 1996, the band performed at the [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile|Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] Festival de la Cancion in Chile, topping the bill alongside [[2 Unlimited]].\n\n===''Flowers'' / ''Cruel Summer'' (1997\u201399)===\n{{Main|Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|l1=Flowers|l2=Cruel Summer}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Ace_Of_Base-Flowers.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ace_Of_Base-Cruel_Summer.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Linn's image was blurred on the cover art of ''[[Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Flowers]]'' and ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]''.\n}} After this, Ace of Base disappeared from the limelight for a while, emerging only in April 1997 for a performance at the World Music Awards and in July 1997 to perform at a concert to celebrate the 20th birthday of [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]] of Sweden. They were given as much time as they wanted to produce their third album, much of it being recorded in Jonas's own studio, \"The Barn\". When it finally was released in June 1998, the band declared it their best album yet. It was titled ''[[Flowers (Ace of Base album)|Flowers]]'' because they believed that the songs, wildly different in style including [[Motown]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] influences, resembled a varied bouquet of flowers. Fans were surprised to see that singer Linn had relinquished lead vocal duties to sister Jenny, and on many promotional photos, Linn's face was blurred.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=[[Platinum & Gold Collection (Ace of Base album)|Platinum & Gold Collection]] |date=6 May 2003 |first=Bill |last=Pitzonka |type=Compact disc booklet |publisher=[[Arista Records|Arista]]}}</ref> They were reassured that Linn was happy with her new backing role in the group, and many reasons were given for her decision, including her having damaged her voice, fear of flying putting her off from traveling around the world and her dislike of fame.<ref name=\"ourstory\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=Linn has relinquished the role of front vocalist and delegated her singing duties to sister Jenny.

British label [[London Records]] had requested the band record the 1983 hit \"[[Cruel Summer (song)|Cruel Summer]]\", by [[Bananarama]] and it was selected as the second European single. Deciding that \"Life Is a Flower\" was \"too European in nature\", Clive Davis pushed \"Cruel Summer\" as the lead-off single for the United States, and it brought Ace of Base back into the US Top 10 for the first time in four years, being certified gold. The album was also renamed ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'' and featured a different track list compared to the European release. For this version of the album, Davis persuaded a reluctant Linn to record the Billy Steinberg-penned ballad \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\". \"Life Is a Flower\" was re-recorded as \"[[Whenever You're Near Me]]\" and four other songs originally on ''Flowers'' were remixed and edited for the U.S. release. \"Whenever You're Near Me\" was released as the second single from ''Cruel Summer,'' peaking at No. 76. \"[[Travel to Romantis]]\" and \"[[Always Have Always Will|Always Have, Always Will]]\" were further singles in Europe while \"Everytime It Rains\" was issued as a single in the UK along with a repackaged edition of ''Flowers'' released only in the UK.\n\n===''Singles of the 90s'' and ''Greatest Hits'' (1999\u20132000)===\n''[[Singles of the 90s]]'', a compilation of sixteen hit singles, was released in November 1999. Its first single, \"[[C'est La Vie (Always 21)]]\", charted modestly in most places where it was released and went on to become a surprise No. 1 hit in Spain. Attempting to capitalize on the success of the previous single, \"[[Hallo Hallo (Ace of Base song)|Hallo Hallo]]\" was released with special remixes just for the Spanish market. The album's marketing push closed with the limited radio-only single release of \"[[Love in December]]\". ''[[Greatest Hits (2000 Ace of Base album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was released for the American market in March 2000. \"Hallo Hallo\" initially was planned to be the first single from the compilation, but in the end, it was not included at all. \"C'est La Vie (Always 21)\" served as the only new recording on the American release. \"[[Everytime It Rains]]\", previously included on the ''[[Cruel Summer (Ace of Base album)|Cruel Summer]]'' album, was released in a new remixed form as a radio single in the US, becoming the only form of promotion for ''Greatest Hits''. With minimal promotion, the album and the single failed to chart, with the former selling fewer than 5,000 copies in its first week.\n\n===''Da Capo'' (2002\u201303)===\n{{Main|Da Capo (Ace of Base album)|l1=Da Capo}}\n[[File:Skl2003.jpg|thumb|upright|Linn of Ace of Base after a performance in 2002]]\nAce of Base released its fourth studio album, ''[[Da Capo (Ace of Base album)|Da Capo]]'', on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through [[Toshiba EMI]] with a different cover and three bonus tracks.

It was intended to be a return to the band's earliest sound.\n\nAlthough the album entered the album charts in many European countries, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria.

However, Arista, the band's American record label at the time, shelved the idea. In Scandinavia, [[Edel-Mega]] released the album's opening track, \"[[Unspeakable (song)|Unspeakable]]\", as the second single, but its poor chart performance ended the promotion of the album prematurely.\n\n===Hiatus (2003\u201306)===\nThe band remained out of the spotlight throughout 2003 and 2004, although Jenny kept busy by performing solo live performances in several Christian shows with her by-then husband Jakob Petr\u00e9n and released an album as a vocalist with the Swedish group Arose.\n\nIn 2005, a handful of songs featuring vocals by both Jenny and Linn were recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeTmeKNt2E|title=Ace of Base - Make My Day (Commentary) [5 of 16]|date=8 March 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref> At the end of 2005, the band reunited, without Linn, for several live performances at the [[Night of the Proms]] in Belgium, alongside other artists such as [[Donna Summer]].\n\n===Reunion (2007\u201309)===\n[[Image:Aob tour.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Jonas, Jenny, and Ulf performing in [[Saint Petersburg]], 2007.|Jonas, Jenny and Ulf during a concert in [[Saint Petersburg]], 2007.]]\nAce of Base reunited as a trio to perform their first full-length concert since 1996 in [[Yekaterinburg]], Russia, on November 15, 2007.

Stringer.</ref>\n\n== Bishop's Residence ==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Partick.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Burgh of [[Partick]], showing the castle and [[mitre]] of the Bishop of Glasgow]]\nFrom the time of [[David I of Scotland|King David's]] grant of land to the Bishops of Glasgow, the country residence of the Bishops was situated in Partick. This is supported by the existence of a deed of 1277 in which Maurice, Lord of [[Luss]] made a contract at ''Perthec'' for the sale of timber to the authorities at [[Glasgow Cathedral]].<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'' p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe Bishops' residence is depicted on the former [[Burgh]] of Partick's coat of arms as a castle.  In 1362, a settlement of a dispute between the Bishop and his chapter house was made at his ''manor-house of Perthic''.<ref>Napier, James (1873) ''Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick''  p. 21.</ref> [[Archbishop of Glasgow|Glasgow's Bishops]] continued to use their residence in Partick until the reformation in 1560, when Bishop [[James Beaton II]] fled to France from there, taking with him the sacred relics from [[Glasgow Cathedral]].<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'' p. 11.</ref>\n\n== The Reformation and after ==\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation|reformation]] in 1560, ownership of the lands returned to the Scottish Crown.  From that time on to the nineteenth century, Partick was part of Govan parish and therefore in [[Renfrewshire]].  The boundary between [[Glasgow]] and Partick was the [[River Kelvin]] (but with a small area over the river at Pointhouse also in Partick).<ref>Matheson, Alex (2000) ''Glasgow's Other River: Exploring the Kelvin'' p. 194.</ref>\n\nPartick was the main crossing point of the River Kelvin for the road between Glasgow and [[Dumbarton]].  From earliest times, the river was crossed by a ford.  Later came a wooden bridge for foot passengers.  It is commonly thought that the first permanent stone bridge over the river was built by [[Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill|Captain Thomas Crawford]] of [[Jordanhill]], who was Provost of Glasgow at the start of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe building known as [[Partick Castle]] lay close to Partick's original ford.  It was built by the Glasgow benefactor, George Hutcheson, and was derelict by the late eighteenth century.\n\n== Milling Centre ==\nPartick remained a relatively small village until the early nineteenth century. The steep drop of the River Kelvin between what is now Glasgow's Botanic Gardens and the river's mouth, led to Partick becoming an important centre of milling, especially grain [[Mill (grinding)|milling]].  While Glasgow's [[Molendinar Burn]] powered a few mills during the medieval period, its flow was insufficient for the needs of the growing burgh, perhaps as early as the twelfth century.<ref>Hume, John (1974) ''The Industrial Archaeology of Glasgow'', p. 4.</ref> So the city came to depend on the rapidly flowing River Kelvin for its milling as well as two other locations: Bedlay (Cadder) and Clydesmill ([[Carmyle]]).<ref>Nisbet, Stuart (2008) ''The Old Mill of Partick'' FORK Newsletter Spring 2008, p. 6.</ref>\n\nRecords of Partick as a milling centre go back to the Middle Ages. A prophecy of [[Thomas the Rhymer]] (thirteenth century) predicts:\n<blockquote>\n'you may walk across the Clyde on men's bodies, and the miller of Partick Mill (''muileann Pearraig''), who is to be a man with seven fingers will grind for two hours with blood instead of water.'<ref>[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900) ''Superstitions of the Highlands & Islands of Scotland''.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBefore the [[English Reformation|reformation]], the inhabitants of Glasgow used to grind their grain at either the Town Mill of Partick or at a nearby small mill belonging to Glasgow's Archbishop.\n\nBy 1820, Partick was a major milling centre, with several located in its vicinity.  These included: the Old Mill (on the site of the building now known as the Bishop's Mill), the Slit Mill, the Archbishop's Mill (later Bunhouse/Regent Mill), the Waulk Mill (now Scotstoun Mill) and the Wee Mill.<ref>Napier James,(1873) ''Partick in 1820'' (Map in frontispiece to 'Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick').</ref>  A little way upstream of Partick, there was also Clayslaps Mill (just below what is now Kelvingrove Museum & Art Gallery).  Such a concentration of mills eventually resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trust building its colossal granaries at Meadowside in Partick in 1911&ndash;1913 (with subsequent extensions in 1936, 1960 and 1967).<ref>Williamson, Elizabeth et al. (1990) ''Glasgow'' in ''The Buildings of Scotland'' series, pp. 374-375.</ref>  These were demolished in 2004 to make way for the [[Glasgow Harbour]] residential development\n\nOf Partick's mills, Scotstoun Mill in Dunaskin Street, owned by Rank Hovis MacDougall, was the last to remain in operation. It closed in 2013.\n\n== Nineteenth Century Development ==\nDuring the nineteenth century Partick developed from a small village into a relatively populous centre as a result of the fast pace of industrial development along the River Clyde and improving communications.  The table<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', p. 154.</ref> below summarises the population of the [[Burgh]] of Partick during the nineteenth century:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

This in turn was made possible by the steady canalisation of the River Clyde between 1773 and 1830's, which deepened and narrowed the river, to make it navigable by large ships.  Canalisation also created 'firmer' banks along great stretches of the River Clyde, enhancing the prospect of their industrial development.  In 1844 Messrs David Tod & John McGregor moved their shipbuilding operation from Govan to Partick.  In 1858 a major step for their enterprise, was the opening of a new graving dock at their Meadowside site. Subsequently, several other shipyards opened along the north bank of the Clyde, including one directly across the mouth of the River Kelvin at Pointhouse (in 1845). Further west along the River Clyde, Barclay Curle's shipyard opened in 1855, precipitating the rapid development of the [[Whiteinch]] area.  This was followed by the opening of Connell's shipyard (1861) and the Yarrow shipyard (1906) both yet further west in [[Scotstoun]].<ref>Hume, John (1974) ''The Industrial Archaeology of Glasgow'' pp. 82-83.</ref>\n\nThe transport of people and goods along the north bank of the River Clyde (between residential and industrial areas) was facilitated by the construction of the [[Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway]], which opened in stages between 1894 and 1896.\n\n==A Police Burgh==\n\nThe Police of Towns (Scotland) Act, 1850 (Lock's Act) made it easier for [[Police burgh|Police Burghs]] to be created. Any \"populous place\" from this time on was able to adopt a police system and become a burgh.\n\nThe pressures caused by Partick's very rapid demographic and industrial expansion proved to be too much for the village's mid-nineteenth century infrastructure.  In June 1852, at a public meeting, the householders of Partick agreed to constitute themselves into a [[Police burgh|Police Burgh]] to remedy a range of common concerns including:\n<blockquote>\n...the defective state of the drainage, the disrepair of the streets and roads, the number and increase of nuisances in the locality, and the inability of the inhabitants to either to compel a proper and efficient system of drainage or to control or abate any nuisance, or to make any sanitary or other regulations for the well being of the community...<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', pp. 137-138.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nTwelve householders were elected as Commissioners.  From among them, the shipbuilder David Tod was elected Partick's first [[Provost (civil)|Provost]].  According to the contemporary local historian, James Napier, these Commissioners (including himself) acted immediately:\n<blockquote>\nThe Commissioners now began to carry out a system of drainage and other sanitary measure with considerable promptitude, and, as the following facts show to great advantage.  The first three years after 1854, the average death rate was 34.5 per 1000 of the population; the average of the last three years (''he was writing in 1875''), including 1872, is 21 per 1000 of the population, showing a saving of many hundred of lives to the community.<ref>Napier, James (1873) ''Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick'', p. 126.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nBy 1853, the Commissioners had built a small administrative building for the Burgh in a palazzo style.  This eventually became Partick's police building which can still seen in Anderson Street (though Partick's Police Station has now been moved to the Thornwood stretch of Dumbarton Road).  In 1872, the larger Partick Burgh Halls were built (in a Francois I style) to a design by William Leiper.<ref>Williamson, Elizabeth et al. (1990) ''Glasgow'' in ''The Buildings of Scotland'' series, p. 372.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Burgh of Partick ceased to exist having been incorporated into the ever-expanding Glasgow Corporation.  A contemporary account relates:\n<blockquote>\nWhile the Burgh Organist played \"Lochaber no More\", the Provost's chain of office was removed from his neck, and as his robe was laid aside the Provost said, \"There they lie, the abandoned habits of the Provost of Partick, taken from him by Act of Parliament.<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', p. 155.</ref>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==List of Provosts of Partick==\n* 1852\u20131857  David Tod\n* 1857\u20131860  John White\n* 1860\u20131863  Robert Robinson\n* 1863\u20131869  Allan Arthur\n* 1869\u20131872  Robert Hunter\n* 1872\u20131875  George Thomson\n* 1875\u20131878  John Ferguson\n* 1878\u20131883  Hugh Kennedy\n* 1883\u20131891  Andrew Maclean\n* 1891\u20131898  James Caird\n* 1898\u20131902  Alexander Wood\n* 1902\u20131905  William Kennedy\n* 1905\u20131908  John White\n* 1908\u20131911  Thomas Logan\n* 1911\u20131912  Thomas Stark Brown\n\nPartick's last Provost was born in Markinch, Fife on 8 January 1855 to Robert Brown and Mary Stark; the 4th of 7 children.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.scotcities.com/westend/partick.htm Partick - Origins and History]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Partick}}\n[[Category:History of Glasgow|Partick]]\n[[Category:Partick]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2018}}\nThis article deals with the history of the [[Partick]] area of [[Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]].\n\n== Etymology of Partick ==\nThe place name ''Partick'' is derived from the [[Cumbric]] word for 'thicket'.

Stringer.</ref>\n\n== Bishop's Residence ==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Partick.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Burgh of [[Partick]], showing the castle and [[mitre]] of the Bishop of Glasgow]]\nFrom the time of [[David I of Scotland|King David's]] grant of land to the Bishops of Glasgow, the country residence of the Bishops was situated in Partick. This is supported by the existence of a deed of 1277 in which Maurice, Lord of [[Luss]] made a contract at ''Perthec'' for the sale of timber to the authorities at [[Glasgow Cathedral]].<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'' p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe Bishops' residence is depicted on the former [[Burgh]] of Partick's coat of arms as a castle.  In 1362, a settlement of a dispute between the Bishop and his chapter house was made at his ''manor-house of Perthic''.<ref>Napier, James (1873) ''Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick''  p. 21.</ref> [[Archbishop of Glasgow|Glasgow's Bishops]] continued to use their residence in Partick until the reformation in 1560, when Bishop [[James Beaton II]] fled to France from there, taking with him the sacred relics from [[Glasgow Cathedral]].<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'' p. 11.</ref>\n\n== The Reformation and after ==\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation|reformation]] in 1560, ownership of the lands returned to the Scottish Crown.  From that time on to the nineteenth century, Partick was part of Govan parish and therefore in [[Renfrewshire]].  The boundary between [[Glasgow]] and Partick was the [[River Kelvin]] (but with a small area over the river at Pointhouse also in Partick).<ref>Matheson, Alex (2000) ''Glasgow's Other River: Exploring the Kelvin'' p. 194.</ref>\n\nPartick was the main crossing point of the River Kelvin for the road between Glasgow and [[Dumbarton]].  From earliest times, the river was crossed by a ford.  Later came a wooden bridge for foot passengers.  It is commonly thought that the first permanent stone bridge over the river was built by [[Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill|Captain Thomas Crawford]] of [[Jordanhill]], who was Provost of Glasgow at the start of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe building known as [[Partick Castle]] lay close to Partick's original ford.  It was built by the Glasgow benefactor, George Hutcheson, and was derelict by the late eighteenth century.\n\n== Milling Centre ==\nPartick remained a relatively small village until the early nineteenth century. The steep drop of the River Kelvin between what is now Glasgow's Botanic Gardens and the river's mouth, led to Partick becoming an important centre of milling, especially grain [[Mill (grinding)|milling]].  While Glasgow's [[Molendinar Burn]] powered a few mills during the medieval period, its flow was insufficient for the needs of the growing burgh, perhaps as early as the twelfth century.<ref>Hume, John (1974) ''The Industrial Archaeology of Glasgow'', p. 4.</ref> So the city came to depend on the rapidly flowing River Kelvin for its milling as well as two other locations: Bedlay (Cadder) and Clydesmill ([[Carmyle]]).<ref>Nisbet, Stuart (2008) ''The Old Mill of Partick'' FORK Newsletter Spring 2008, p. 6.</ref>\n\nRecords of Partick as a milling centre go back to the Middle Ages. A prophecy of [[Thomas the Rhymer]] (thirteenth century) predicts:\n<blockquote>\n'you may walk across the Clyde on men's bodies, and the miller of Partick Mill (''muileann Pearraig''), who is to be a man with seven fingers will grind for two hours with blood instead of water.'<ref>[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900) ''Superstitions of the Highlands & Islands of Scotland''.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBefore the [[English Reformation|reformation]], the inhabitants of Glasgow used to grind their grain at either the Town Mill of Partick or at a nearby small mill belonging to Glasgow's Archbishop.\n\nBy 1820, Partick was a major milling centre, with several located in its vicinity.  These included: the Old Mill (on the site of the building now known as the Bishop's Mill), the Slit Mill, the Archbishop's Mill (later Bunhouse/Regent Mill), the Waulk Mill (now Scotstoun Mill) and the Wee Mill.<ref>Napier James,(1873) ''Partick in 1820'' (Map in frontispiece to 'Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick').</ref>  A little way upstream of Partick, there was also Clayslaps Mill (just below what is now Kelvingrove Museum & Art Gallery).  Such a concentration of mills eventually resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trust building its colossal granaries at Meadowside in Partick in 1911&ndash;1913 (with subsequent extensions in 1936, 1960 and 1967).<ref>Williamson, Elizabeth et al. (1990) ''Glasgow'' in ''The Buildings of Scotland'' series, pp. 374-375.</ref>  These were demolished in 2004 to make way for the [[Glasgow Harbour]] residential development\n\nOf Partick's mills, Scotstoun Mill in Dunaskin Street, owned by Rank Hovis MacDougall, was the last to remain in operation. It closed in 2013.\n\n== Nineteenth Century Development ==\nDuring the nineteenth century Partick developed from a small village into a relatively populous centre as a result of the fast pace of industrial development along the River Clyde and improving communications.  The table<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', p. 154.</ref> below summarises the population of the [[Burgh]] of Partick during the nineteenth century:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Population\n|-\n| 1820\n| 1,235\n|-\n| 1834\n| 1,842\n|-\n| 1841\n| 3,184\n|-\n| 1851\n| 5,043\n|-\n| 1861\n| 10,917\n|-\n| 1871\n| 17,707\n|-\n| 1881\n| 27,410\n|-\n| 1891\n| 36,538\n|-\n| 1901\n| 54,274\n|-\n| 1911\n| 66,848\n|}\n\nThe development of the [[Clydeside]] [[ship building]] industry, in particular, gave momentum to Partick's rapid expansion.  This in turn was made possible by the steady canalisation of the River Clyde between 1773 and 1830's, which deepened and narrowed the river, to make it navigable by large ships.  Canalisation also created 'firmer' banks along great stretches of the River Clyde, enhancing the prospect of their industrial development.  In 1844 Messrs David Tod & John McGregor moved their shipbuilding operation from Govan to Partick.  In 1858 a major step for their enterprise, was the opening of a new graving dock at their Meadowside site. Subsequently, several other shipyards opened along the north bank of the Clyde, including one directly across the mouth of the River Kelvin at Pointhouse (in 1845). Further west along the River Clyde, Barclay Curle's shipyard opened in 1855, precipitating the rapid development of the [[Whiteinch]] area.  This was followed by the opening of Connell's shipyard (1861) and the Yarrow shipyard (1906) both yet further west in [[Scotstoun]].<ref>Hume, John (1974) ''The Industrial Archaeology of Glasgow'' pp. 82-83.</ref>\n\nThe transport of people and goods along the north bank of the River Clyde (between residential and industrial areas) was facilitated by the construction of the [[Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway]], which opened in stages between 1894 and 1896.\n\n==A Police Burgh==\n\nThe Police of Towns (Scotland) Act, 1850 (Lock\u2019s Act) made it easier for [[Police burgh|Police Burghs]] to be created. Any \"populous place\" from this time on was able to adopt a police system and become a burgh.\n\nThe pressures caused by Partick's very rapid demographic and industrial expansion proved to be too much for the village's mid-nineteenth century infrastructure.  In June 1852, at a public meeting, the householders of Partick agreed to constitute themselves into a [[Police burgh|Police Burgh]] to remedy a range of common concerns including:\n<blockquote>\n...the defective state of the drainage, the disrepair of the streets and roads, the number and increase of nuisances in the locality, and the inability of the inhabitants to either to compel a proper and efficient system of drainage or to control or abate any nuisance, or to make any sanitary or other regulations for the well being of the community...<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', pp. 137-138.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nTwelve householders were elected as Commissioners.  From among them, the shipbuilder David Tod was elected Partick's first [[Provost (civil)|Provost]].  According to the contemporary local historian, James Napier, these Commissioners (including himself) acted immediately:\n<blockquote>\nThe Commissioners now began to carry out a system of drainage and other sanitary measure with considerable promptitude, and, as the following facts show to great advantage.  The first three years after 1854, the average death rate was 34.5 per 1000 of the population; the average of the last three years (''he was writing in 1875''), including 1872, is 21 per 1000 of the population, showing a saving of many hundred of lives to the community.<ref>Napier, James (1873) ''Notes And Reminiscences Relating To Partick'', p. 126.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nBy 1853, the Commissioners had built a small administrative building for the Burgh in a palazzo style.  This eventually became Partick's police building which can still seen in Anderson Street (though Partick's Police Station has now been moved to the Thornwood stretch of Dumbarton Road).  In 1872, the larger Partick Burgh Halls were built (in a Francois I style) to a design by William Leiper.<ref>Williamson, Elizabeth et al. (1990) ''Glasgow'' in ''The Buildings of Scotland'' series, p. 372.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Burgh of Partick ceased to exist having been incorporated into the ever-expanding Glasgow Corporation.  A contemporary account relates:\n<blockquote>\nWhile the Burgh Organist played \"Lochaber no More\", the Provost's chain of office was removed from his neck, and as his robe was laid aside the Provost said, \"There they lie, the abandoned habits of the Provost of Partick, taken from him by Act of Parliament.<ref>Greenhorne, William (1928) ''History of Partick 550-1912'', p. 155.</ref>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==List of Provosts of Partick==\n* 1852\u20131857  David Tod\n* 1857\u20131860  John White\n* 1860\u20131863  Robert Robinson\n* 1863\u20131869  Allan Arthur\n* 1869\u20131872  Robert Hunter\n* 1872\u20131875  George Thomson\n* 1875\u20131878  John Ferguson\n* 1878\u20131883  Hugh Kennedy\n* 1883\u20131891  Andrew Maclean\n* 1891\u20131898  James Caird\n* 1898\u20131902  Alexander Wood\n* 1902\u20131905  William Kennedy\n* 1905\u20131908  John White\n* 1908\u20131911  Thomas Logan\n* 1911\u20131912  Thomas Stark Brown\n\nPartick's last Provost was born in Markinch, Fife on 8 January 1855 to Robert Brown and Mary Stark; the 4th of 7 children.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.scotcities.com/westend/partick.htm Partick - Origins and History]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Partick}}\n[[Category:History of Glasgow|Partick]]\n[[Category:Partick]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eA Police Burgh:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Partick"}
