{"title_page": "Canadian Mental Health Association", "text_new": "{{short description|Canadian mental health non-profit organization}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{advert|date=September 2012}}\n}}\nThe '''Canadian Mental Health Association''' (CMHA) is the [[Canada|Canadian]] association founded on April 26, 1918 by Dr. [[Clarence M. Hincks]] and [[Clifford W. Beers]]. Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally began as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH), founded by Dr. Clarence M. Hincks and Clifford W. Beers on April 26, 1918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks was very interested in the field because he had experienced bouts of [[mental illness]] and noticed a lack of support for veterans' mental health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of the organization included objectives like a psychiatric examination of recruits, adequate care of returned soldiers suffering from mental disabilities, a mental examination of immigrants to ensure a better selection of newcomers, adequate facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cases of mental disease, adequate care of the mentally deficient, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding medical professionals to join the committee such as C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks then established a Board of Directors, including Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks gained support through \"drawing-room meetings\" where socially prominent women invited their wealthy and influential friends for afternoon teas. Co-founder Clifford W. Beers, would then present on Beers' mental illness and the sometimes abusive treatment he received. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved  successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hospital Surveys ===\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake a project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection of soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\n=== Schoolchildren Surveys ===\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. Under the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction in the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== Peer Support Canada ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools. Participants also have access to an exclusive online portal, as well as national recognition from the Canadian Mental Health Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notmyselftoday.ca/what-you-receive/|title=Not Myself Today - What You Receive|website=www.notmyselftoday.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Carryit ===\nThe CMHA introduced Carryit in 2019, a toolkit to be used by those involved in schools to carry with them in case of opioid overdoses. The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health. This statement followed a survey commissioned by the CMHA discovered that over half of Canadians (53%) consider anxiety and depression to be \u2018epidemic\u2019 in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/over-half-of-canadians-consider-anxiety-and-depression-epidemic|title=Over half of Canadians consider anxiety and depression \u2018epidemic\u2019|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid Crisis Response ===\nFollowing the escalating rates of opioid-related injuries and deaths in Canada in 2009, CMHA developed and in-depth evidence-based policy and regulation paper directed at the Canadian government, policy markers and health organizations. CMHA gathered resources and organizations such as the Public Policy Working Group, the National Council of Persons with Lived Experience, the national provincial executive team and the national board of directors in drafting this policy paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/care-not-corrections-relieving-the-opioid-crisis-in-canada|title=Care not Corrections: Relieving the Opioid Crisis in Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund ===\nIn August 2009, the CMHA endorsed Health Action Lobby\u2019s (HEAL) document concluding that a health human resources infrastructure is required in Canada. CMHA cited an aging workforce and a higher volume and complexity of population health needs as reasons to establish this fund, along with the fact that the last similar act (Health Resources Fund Act) was introduced over 50 years ago in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/a-proposal-to-establish-a-national-health-human-resources-infrastructure-fund|title=A Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Shortcomings ==\n\n=== Kingston Branch Closure ===\nIn March of 2020, the Canadian Mental Health Association was forced to close down its Kingston Branch due to a lack of financial support. After 40 years of operations, the branch's overhead costs  were too high to sustain and were not being met through the fundraising efforts and grants that fuel the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6589257/kingston-branch-cmha-closure/|title=Kingston branch of Canadian Mental Health Association announces closure: \u2018It has been a privilege\u2019|website=Global News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> A change in Ontario's health funding as well as insufficient donations did not provide adequate capital to continue operations. The branch focused on ensuring programs previously offered through the Kingston CMHA would be adopted and available through other non-for-profit agencies, including the Polson Park Free Methodist Church, TransFamily Kingston, and Elizabeth Fry Kingston.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingstonist.com/news/cmha-kingston-branch-announces-upcoming-closure/|title=CMHA Kingston Branch announces upcoming closure \u2013 Kingston News|date=2020-02-24|website=Kingstonist News - 100% local, independent news in Kingston, ON|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> All remaining funds were donated to partners within the community.\n\n=== Bill C-14 ===\nIn June of 2016, Bill C-14 passed through the Parliament of Canada to legalize [[euthanasia in Canada]]. The bill made it so that those who wish to receive a medically assisted death are permitted to do so through the assistance of a medical practitioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/C-14/|title=Bill C-14 (Historical) {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> In September of 2017, the Canadian Mental Health Association released a public declaration opposing the bill, asserting that recovery is possible for those with metal health issues and that MAiD should not be treated as a substitute for treatment and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The CMHA proposed recommendations to the Canadian government including investments in mental health and addiction services, a national suicide prevention strategy, and research.

Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally began as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH), founded by Dr. Clarence M. Hincks and Clifford W. Beers on April 26, 1918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks was very interested in the field because he had experienced bouts of [[mental illness]] and noticed a lack of support for veterans' mental health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of the organization included objectives like a psychiatric examination of recruits, adequate care of returned soldiers suffering from mental disabilities, a mental examination of immigrants to ensure a better selection of newcomers, adequate facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cases of mental disease, adequate care of the mentally deficient, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding medical professionals to join the committee such as C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks then established a Board of Directors, including Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks gained support through \"drawing-room meetings\" where socially prominent women invited their wealthy and influential friends for afternoon teas. Co-founder Clifford W. Beers, would then present on Beers' mental illness and the sometimes abusive treatment he received. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved  successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hospital Surveys ===\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake a project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection of soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\n=== Schoolchildren Surveys ===\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. Under the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction in the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== '''Peer''' '''Support Canada''' ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools. Participants also have access to an exclusive online portal, as well as national recognition from the Canadian Mental Health Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notmyselftoday.ca/what-you-receive/|title=Not Myself Today - What You Receive|website=www.notmyselftoday.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Carryit ===\nThe CMHA introduced Carryit in 2019, a toolkit to be used by those involved in schools to carry with them in case of opioid overdoses. The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health. This statement followed a survey commissioned by the CMHA discovered that over half of Canadians (53%) consider anxiety and depression to be \u2018epidemic\u2019 in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/over-half-of-canadians-consider-anxiety-and-depression-epidemic|title=Over half of Canadians consider anxiety and depression \u2018epidemic\u2019|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid Crisis Response ===\nFollowing the escalating rates of opioid-related injuries and deaths in Canada in 2009, CMHA developed and in-depth evidence-based policy and regulation paper directed at the Canadian government, policy markers and health organizations. CMHA gathered resources and organizations such as the Public Policy Working Group, the National Council of Persons with Lived Experience, the national provincial executive team and the national board of directors in drafting this policy paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/care-not-corrections-relieving-the-opioid-crisis-in-canada|title=Care not Corrections: Relieving the Opioid Crisis in Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund ===\nIn August 2009, the CMHA endorsed Health Action Lobby\u2019s (HEAL) document concluding that a health human resources infrastructure is required in Canada. CMHA cited an aging workforce and a higher volume and complexity of population health needs as reasons to establish this fund, along with the fact that the last similar act (Health Resources Fund Act) was introduced over 50 years ago in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/a-proposal-to-establish-a-national-health-human-resources-infrastructure-fund|title=A Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Shortcomings ==\n\n=== Kingston Branch Closure ===\nIn March of 2020, the Canadian Mental Health Association was forced to close down its Kingston Branch due to a lack of financial support. After 40 years of operations, the branch's overhead costs  were too high to sustain and were not being met through the fundraising efforts and grants that fuel the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6589257/kingston-branch-cmha-closure/|title=Kingston branch of Canadian Mental Health Association announces closure: \u2018It has been a privilege\u2019|website=Global News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> A change in Ontario's health funding as well as insufficient donations did not provide adequate capital to continue operations. The branch focused on ensuring programs previously offered through the Kingston CMHA would be adopted and available through other non-for-profit agencies, including the Polson Park Free Methodist Church, TransFamily Kingston, and Elizabeth Fry Kingston.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingstonist.com/news/cmha-kingston-branch-announces-upcoming-closure/|title=CMHA Kingston Branch announces upcoming closure \u2013 Kingston News|date=2020-02-24|website=Kingstonist News - 100% local, independent news in Kingston, ON|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> All remaining funds were donated to partners within the community.\n\n=== Bill C-14 ===\nIn June of 2016, Bill C-14 passed through the Parliament of Canada to legalize [[euthanasia in Canada]]. The bill made it so that those who wish to receive a medically assisted death are permitted to do so through the assistance of a medical practitioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/C-14/|title=Bill C-14 (Historical) {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> In September of 2017, the Canadian Mental Health Association released a public declaration opposing the bill, asserting that recovery is possible for those with metal health issues and that MAiD should not be treated as a substitute for treatment and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The CMHA proposed recommendations to the Canadian government including investments in mental health and addiction services, a national suicide prevention strategy, and research. Despite the CMHA's declaration and recommendations, Bill C-14 is still enacted as law to this day.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mental health]]\n*[[Mental Health Commission of Canada]]\n*[[Mary Scullion]]\n*[[Ride Don't Hide]] - Charity riding event to raise awareness of mental issues\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.cmha.ca}}\n*[https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha Canadian Mental Health Association history]\n\n[[Category:Mental health organizations in Canada]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Medical associations based in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Rpaylor", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Mental_Health_Association"}

In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open-source software|open-source]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and thus renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]].

The new Preemption feature in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 allows users to set priorities on different work so that, if a higher priority application must use resources currently allocated to a lower priority application, the lower priority application will effectively be \u201cpaused\u201d\u2014not lost\u2014and work will automatically resume once the higher priority application is completed. Among a handful of other new features added to Grid Engine 8.3.0 to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the cluster, is the new Run Time Modification of Resources feature. The Run Time Modification of Resources feature means much more efficient use of cluster resources.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.1 was released on August 28, 2015. This release contained all of the new features in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 and additional fixes and enhancements identified since the release of 8.3.0.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.4.0 was released on May 31, 2016. This release supports [[Docker (software)|Docker]] containers and will automatically dispatch and run jobs with a user specified Docker Image.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2016/05312016.php|title=New Version of Univa Grid Engine|last=univa|website=www.univa.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref>\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.5.0 was released on March 7, 2017.

This update also improved Univa Grid Engine job dispatch information.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.3 was released on September 27, 2018. This update introduced bulk configuration changes for Univa Grid Engine hosts. Bulk configuration changes perform operations on many hosts simultaneously, making it easier to manage large Univa Grid Engine clusters.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.4 was released on November 23, 2018, providing new core binding strategies making it easier to specify how jobs are placed on nodes and cores while also providing more flexibility. A new affinity-based job placement policy was included in this update. Jobs submitted using affinity can be packed close together (\u201cpositive affinity\u201d) or spread across the cluster (\u201cnegative affinity\u201d) based on resources requested. New Univa Grid Engine Resource Maps syntax provides more granular control over application access to host devices such as NVIDIA GPUs. This allows jobs to request GPUs and ensure that GPUs are exclusively assigned to the specific job. Univa Grid Engine was also enhanced to directly communicate with NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) in this release to collect GPU metrics for scheduling and accounting.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.5 was released on May 6, 2019.

The basic format of The Midnight Caller was to have listeners call-in with Tom and Glenn making fun of them (or \"razzing\" them) and soon after hanging-up on them. The show's novelty and originality made it an underground hit{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} in the Ottawa area.\n\n====Rapper====\nIn the early 1990s, Green had a short-lived career as a rapper in a group called [[Organized Rhyme]] under the alias \"[[MC Bones]]\". His fellow MCs included \"Pin the Chameleon\". The single \"Check The O.R.\" was nominated  for a [[Juno Award]] in [[Juno Awards of 1993#Best Rap Recording|1993 for Best Rap Recording]] and won the [[MuchVibe Best Rap Video (MMVA Award)|MuchVibe Best Rap Video]] award in 1992.\n\nIn 1998, ''[[Not The Green Tom Show]]'' was released by Green's alter-ego [[MC Face]]. The theme of the album revolves around MC Face, a pugnacious and foul-mouthed rapper who is constantly angry with and taking verbal jabs at Tom Green, his square producer who brings on some of his buddies from ''The Tom Green Show''.\n\n====''The Tom Green Show''====\n{{main|The Tom Green Show}}\nGreen soon had his own non-paid television show on [[public-access television]] on [[cable TV]]. The first incarnation of ''The Tom Green Show'' aired from September 1994 until 1996 as a one-hour no commercial public cable access program on [[Rogers Television|Rogers Television 22]] in the [[Ottawa]] region airing 50 episodes in two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|title=Tom Green Timeline|publisher=ottawacomedy.com|accessdate=2010-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424051157/http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|archive-date=2010-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Tom Green Show'' was a [[variety show]] format, where he would have guests visit the studio and bands play before a live audience.

A number of them involved Green's parents, Richard and Mary Jane, who consistently appeared unamused and occasionally angered by Tom's antics.\nIn October 1996, ''The Tom Green Show'' aired one time as a pilot on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. The show was later picked up in Canada by [[The Comedy Network]] in 1997 and aired 26 episodes over the course of two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\"/>\n\n===Rise to mainstream (1999\u20132003)===\n\n====MTV and ''The Tom Green Show''====\n{{main|The Tom Green Show}}\n''The Tom Green Show'' was then picked up by [[MTV]] in January 1999, where he gained popularity in the United States and worldwide. The format of the MTV version of the show was similar to his original show; it was hosted by Green and co-hosted by two of his long-time friends, Glenn Humplik, who occupied the couch, and Phil Giroux, who sat behind a window at the back of the set and became known as \"the guy in the window\" usually drinking cups of coffee. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be unimpressed and embarrassed by their son's antics.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\"/>\n\n''The Tom Green Show'' was renowned for Green's version of [[shock humor]]. Some of Green's most notable skits include pretending to \"hump\" a dead [[moose]] (which was referenced by rapper [[Eminem]] in \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\"), having an [[X-rated]] lesbian scene  painted on his father's car (labeled the \"Slut Mobile\"), drinking milk by sucking on a cow's teat, and putting a cow head in his parents' bed while they slept because his father was a fan of ''[[The Godfather]]'' films. Green also hung his own unauthorized piece of art in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] (which remained untouched for days) with the added twist of later coming back and vandalizing it to the horror of onlooking patrons.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://entertainmentcentralpittsburgh.com/nightlife/tom-green/|title= Tom Green: Entertainment Renaissance Man|author=Rick Handler  |publisher= Entertainment Central|date = November 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a segment, Green went to the press conference of ''[[Grey Owl (film)|Grey Owl]]'' where he serenaded and kissed [[Pierce Brosnan]]. Brosnan, thinking Green was a [[journalist]], advised him not to give up his day job. Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green teased him about this often and once gave out Humplik's office phone number on the air.\n\nGreen eventually wrote a song called \"[[Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)]]\", which he composed during MTV's Spring Break while doing a show on a cruise ship. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and was also referred to in Eminem's song \"The Real Slim Shady\". He quickly called for the video to be retired because \"it's not fair to [[98 Degrees]].\" Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that ''Total Request Live'' was, in fact, a live request show (the next week's episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of \"The Bum Bum Song\" at the time).\n\nGreen's increasing fame made it harder for him to ambush people during [[Vox populi|man-on-the-street]] segments, leading him to target mostly [[old age|senior citizens]] and non-[[English language|English]] speakers. After he was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in March 2000, he stopped production of new episodes of his TV show but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. Green's popularity during this time led to him gracing the cover of the June 8, 2000 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.\n\nThe MTV show ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' debuted six months after ''The Tom Green Show'' went on hiatus. Many of the segments on the show had close similarities to the segments from Green's show: [[Bam Margera]] rudely awakening his parents, the cast of ''Jackass'' falling down while on crutches, swimming with sharks, etc.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://crujonessociety.com/2009/12/16/lee-s-harts-5-favorite-tv-shows-of-the-00s/\n| title      = Lee S.

Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, and there is no evidence to suggest that such an event occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/tomgreen.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Tom Green Hitler Bar Mitzvah |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, ''[[Hollywood Causes Cancer]]'', stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name \"Tom Green.\" Green says, \"I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that \u2013 it's both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, I've never even been to a Bar Mitzvah.\"\n\n====Film career====\nGreen's fame soon netted him roles in several Hollywood movies, including ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' (which he also wrote and directed), and ''[[Stealing Harvard]].'' Green continued the trend of his brand of comedy in ''Road Trip'' in a notable scene where he put a mouse in his mouth.\n\n''Freddy Got Fingered'' won in five categories at the [[2001 Golden Raspberry Awards]], given to the worst movies of the year. Green appeared at the ceremony to accept his awards, making him the first performer to do so in the award's twenty-year history, and the second recipient to do so following director [[Paul Verhoeven]] for ''[[Showgirls]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1889555.stm|title=Green gets fingered for Razzies|publisher=BBC News|last=Waters|first=Darren|date=March 23, 2002|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> Green arrived at the awards ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolled out his own red carpet.<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> After accepting the awards, Green stated \"When we set out to make this film we wanted to win a Razzie, so this is a dream come true for me\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> While onstage, he began to play the [[harmonica]] and did not stop until he was dragged off.\n\n====Marriage to Drew Barrymore and ''Saturday Night Live''====\nIn July 2000, Tom Green became engaged to actress [[Drew Barrymore]]. Green and Barrymore met after Barrymore, who was a fan of Green's show, asked Green to appear in ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', which Barrymore starred in and produced.

The most notable incident came on November 18, 2000, when Green hosted the American television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. During the [[monologue]], Green brought Barrymore on stage and teased the audience about the couple marrying at the end of the episode. Ultimately, the stage was set for a wedding before Barrymore, in the end, got \"cold feet\" and left Green alone to end the show. The SNL incident initially left viewers and the media confused about whether the couple had actually planned to marry on live TV, or were simply staging a publicity stunt. Eventually, Green also went on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' to toy with the public once again, this time claiming that his bride might be [[pregnancy|pregnant]].{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nBarrymore and Green filed for [[divorce]] on December 17, 2001, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].<ref name=\"divorce\">{{cite web|first=Jeanne|last=Darst|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|title=Tom Green Files for a Divorce from Drew|accessdate=2008-09-07|date=2001-12-18|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005070527/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|archivedate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Their divorce became official on October 15, 2002.<ref name=\"divorce\"/>\n\n====Return to MTV and ''The New Tom Green Show''====\nIn 2002, Green starred in and directed a one-hour MTV special called ''The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour'', where he tormented strangers in [[Japan]].

Green was a recurring contributor to ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''; doing many segments where he travels across America looking for \"interesting people\", typically bringing the most colourful person with him back to the studio. In these segments, the focus is more on the odd behavior of the interviewees, with Green generally playing the straight man.\n\n[[File:Tom Green and the Carpet Frogs Perform in Afghanistan 110308-A-UJ825-165.jpg|thumb|Green performing with the [[USO]] in Afghanistan, 2011]]\nIn 2003, Green visited troops in [[Kosovo]] on a [[USO]] tour.

In an October 2013 interview, Green stated that he preferred \"great interviewers who know when to sit back and listen\" rather than being an interviewer that \"wanted to be as funny as the guest and...get into a sort of competitive relationship with them\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetvpage.com/2013/10/17/interview-tom-green-eyes-miley-letterman-for-new-axs-talk-show/|title=Tom Green Eyes Miley, Letterman For New AXS Talk Show|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=2013-10-17|publisher=thetvpage.com}}</ref>\n\n====''Tomgreen.com: The Channel'' (2006\u20132011, 2015)====\n{{main|Tom Green's House Tonight}}\n[[File:Tom Green, Thora Birch and Neil Hamburger.jpg|thumb|left|Green, [[Thora Birch]], and [[Neil Hamburger]] at The Channel in 2006]]\nOn June 5, 2006, [[ManiaTV.com]] announced they had formed a partnership with Green to host a live talk show from his own living room in the [[Hollywood Hills]] overlooking the [[San Fernando Valley]]. The first show aired live on June 15, 2006 at 11&nbsp;pm EST, was originally called ''[[Tom Green Live!]]'', and was airing Mondays through Thursdays.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0813913|title=Tom Green Live}}</ref> In January 2008, shortly after Green's split from ManiaTV, the show was renamed ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]''. The shows are broadcast live at TomGreen.com. A pared-down version was later broadcast on [[The Comedy Network]] and various local channels in the United States, until Green stopped syndicating the show to television. On a 2009 blog, Green noted that he stopped his show from syndication on television due to dissatisfaction with his lack of creative control. He continues to broadcast the show from his website. Green later started a monthly subscription service that allowed subscribers to have full access to all the videos on his website.\n\nDue to lack of an established term, Green often refers to his live streaming broadcast as \"Web-o-Vision.\" He also jokingly says he is broadcasting to \"The National Internet\", despite the show having a worldwide audience. Green often refers to his show as, \"The highest rated, longest running, and only talk show on the Internet.\"\n\nFrom Green's website, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' typically aired live on weeknights at 10&nbsp;pm EST, although shows can begin at any time during the day and night. The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and [[Skype]] video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often be a victim of [[prank call]]s due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with the callers. On top of the live web show, Green has added many video segments from his past as well as present.\n\nIn 2007, \"Tom Green Live\" won the 2007 TV Guide \"Online Video Award\" for Best Web Talk Show. In 2008, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' won a 2007 [[Webby Award]] for \"Best Variety Show\".<ref name=\"webby\">{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|title=2007 Webby Award Winners|publisher=webbyawards.com|accessdate=2012-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020213400/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|archivedate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Green 2006 (141261244) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Green in 2006|right]]\n\nAs host of the show, Green often plays the straight man while interviewing guests. There have been hundreds of shows with many notable guests including stars such as [[Adam Carolla]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Thora Birch]], [[Pamela Anderson]], hip-hop artists [[Blackalicious]] and [[Xzibit]], skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]], former ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' host and talk show host [[Carson Daly]], guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], actor [[Crispin Glover]], [[Digg|Digg.com]] founder [[Kevin Rose]], comedic musician [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], as well as comedians [[Neil Hamburger]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Joe Rogan]], and [[Andy Dick]]. The longest standard format show, in which Green interviewed [[Steve-O]], ran for 3.5 hours and ended with Green drunk and Steve-O heavily [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]].\n\nWhen Green does not have guests, he has done many unconventional shows such as playing the saxophone for an hour, having a week dedicated to performing [[karaoke]], or updating the viewers about ''The Channel'' while taking telephone and Skype calls.\n\nOn his website, Green has talked about the substantial costs of continuing the online show and that ''The Channel'' may be gone in mid-2011 if it is not profitable by then. In 2011, Green ended the subscription service on his website and stated that his live show is on hiatus. Green also took down the TV studio that was in his living room.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Green brought back his web-o-vision show and hosts it daily from his studio in Burbank.\n\n===Tom Green Live at The SModcastle (2010)===\nFrom October \u2013 December 2010, Green did seven weekly podcasts interviewing guests at [[Kevin Smith]]'s [[Smodcastle#SModcastle|SModcastle]]. This was done in a long format interview style in a theater that held an audience of 50 people.\n\n====Tom Green Radio (2013\u2013present)====\nFrom January 2013 to mid 2013, Green started doing an audio podcast entitled ''Tom Green Radio'' for his website and downloadable on [[iTunes]] and tomgreen.com.<ref name=\"tgradio\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tom-green-radio/id599173233 |title=iTunes \u2013 Podcasts \u2013 Tom Green Radio by PodcastOne |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}</ref> Guests have included [[Bryan Callen]], [[Steve-O]], [[Kat Von D]], [[Neil Hamburger]], and [[deadmau5]].

The show was similar to his web show where there is a featured guest and a long format one-hour discussion. Additionally, fans can call in from Skype. Scheduled guests have included [[Richard Belzer]], [[Howie Mandel]], and [[Tony Hawk]]. Season 2 debuted on January 9, 2014 and the finale was April 3, 2014. The show renewed with season 3 debuting on June 12, 2014 and concluded its run with AXS TV on November 20, 2014.\n\n===Stand-up comedy (2010\u2013present)===\nIn Green's comedy acts, he focuses on traditional stand-up comedy that has included rap performances. He voices his thoughts on [[social media]], [[technology]], his career in show business, oppression, and social political commentary on society. He often takes time to meet with people in the audience afterwards.\n\nOn numerous interviews, Green has stated that he started doing stand-up comedy at the age of 15 but stopped after he started his public-access television show.<ref name=\"punchline\">{{cite web|url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/tom-green-comic-mercenary|title=Tom Green Interview on Punchline Magazine|date=February 16, 2010|publisher=punchlinemagazine.com|accessdate=2010-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219055343/http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/tom-green-comic-mercenary/|archive-date=February 19, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Green said that going back to stand-up comedy was something he always wanted to do.<ref name=\"punchline\"/>\n\nIn September 2009, Green performed several stand-up comedy shows in Los Angeles, and later appeared at a [[MySpace]] secret stand-up event in New York. On November 10, 2009, he announced his first ever world stand-up comedy tour<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomgreen.com/blog/?post=770|title=Tom Green World Comedy Tour|date=November 10, 2009|publisher=tomgreen.com|accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref> and as of January 2010, has been touring the world going to countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"worldtour\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomgreen.com/tour|title=Tom Green, World Standup Comedy Tour|publisher=tomgreen.com|accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2010, he performed in [[Belleville, Ontario]] at the Empire Theatre with his parents and brother in attendance.  Green dressed in a [[Belleville Bulls]] jersey donated by a local movie studio he had visited earlier that day.  He discussed the city's recent ordeal involving the sentencing of disgraced CFB Trenton Base Commander [[Russell Williams (colonel)|Russell Williams]], stating that he hoped Williams \"was having an awesome weekend\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nOn August 13, 2010, after being invited, Green performed stand-up comedy at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]]. He was later involved in attempting to calm the audience down after [[Tila Tequila]] had rocks, [[excrement]] and [[urine]] thrown at her during her performance at the same event.<ref name=\"driven\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drivenbyboredom.com/2010/08/18/tila-tequila-at-the-gathering-of-the-juggalos/|title=Tila Tequila At The Gathering Of The Juggalos |publisher=drivenbyboredom.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> In subsequent interviews, Green said he successfully calmed the audience down for 10 minutes, but things got worse when he left the stage. Tequila continued performing for an additional 20 minutes and eventually suffered facial injuries after being struck in the face by a rock.<ref name=\"driven\" />\n\nIn an April 2013 interview on discussing his theories on his stand-up comedy, Green states:<ref name=\"worldtour2\">{{cite web|url=http://appletonhub.postcrescent.com/article/20130410/APC0507/304100298/Q-A-grown-up-Tom-Green-takes-his-comedy-back-stage|title=Q&A: A grown-up Tom Green takes his comedy back to the stage|publisher=postcrescent.com|accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\n{{bquote|I don't really like picking on the little guy.

I'm not just trying to get a laugh from people, but I actually want people to walk out of there and critically analyze how we\u2019re living our lives in this modern era. We're stuck on our Facebook pages and giving up our privacy in a surveillance society and we're forced to go through metal detectors and X-ray machines everywhere we go and giving up our freedoms and living in a fear-based society afraid of terrorism and war and all this stuff.

Known for his own unique brand of [[Shock humour|shock comedy]], he found mainstream prominence via his [[MTV]] show aptly titled ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'' (1994\u20132000). Green is also known for his roles in the [[Hollywood]] films ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'' (2000), ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (2000), ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' (2001; directed by Green himself), ''[[Stealing Harvard]]'' (2002) and ''[[Shred (film)|Shred]]'' (2008). He was briefly married to actress [[Drew Barrymore]] (2001\u20132002), who co-starred with him in ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''Freddy Got Fingered''.\n\nIn June 2003, Green served as a [[guest host]] on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', which led to him hosting his own [[late-night talk show]] on MTV titled ''[[The New Tom Green Show]]'' (2003 only). From 2006 until 2011, he hosted his internet talk show ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]'' from his living room, and began performing [[stand-up comedy]] in 2010. From October 2013 to November 2014, Green hosted the weekly talk show ''[[Tom Green Live]]'' on American cable network [[AXS TV]].\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[Ontario]], Canada, the older of two sons born to Mary Jane, a communications consultant, and Richard Green, a computer systems analyst and retired army captain.<ref name=\"tgbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/81/Tom-Green.html|title=Tom Green Biography (1971-)|publisher= FilmReference.com|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> He grew up on a [[Canadian Army]] base near Pembroke, CFB Petawawa, and  in [[Ottawa]], (then the City of [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]]) where he attended [[Henry Munro Middle School]], [[Colonel By Secondary School]] and [[Cairine Wilson Secondary School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338381/bio |publisher=IMDB|title=Tom Green|year=2010|accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Green studied television broadcasting at [[Algonquin College]] and graduated in 1994.\n\n==Career==\n===Early work (1986\u20131999)===\n\n====Stand-up comedy====\nAt age 15, Green started performing stand-up comedy at local clubs, most notably at [[Yuk Yuk's]] comedy club, and went on to do this for two and a half years until he cancelled a booking to go to New York for his rap group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2010/01/13/tom-green-interview-for-jan-15-17-funny-farm-appearance/#add-comment|title=Tom Green interview for Jan. 15\u201317 Funny Farm appearance|publisher=Access Atlanta|last=Ho|first=Rodney|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=2010-02-14}}</ref><ref name=\"punchlinerap\">{{cite web|url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/video-interview-tom-green/|title=Punchline Magazine Video interview \u2013 Tom Green|publisher=punchlinemagazine.com|accessdate=2010-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416143312/http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/video-interview-tom-green/|archive-date=2010-04-16|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"tgrollingstone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/TomGreen/posts/10151180785682828|title=With angel Drew Barrymore in his corner, the MTV prankster turns his battle with testicular cancer into a comedy special and rethinks his life \u2013 June 2000|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nWhile attending Algonquin College as a member of the Sigma Pi Fraternity, Green hosted an overnight call-in show on the [[University of Ottawa]]'s campus radio station, [[CHUO-FM|CHUO]]. The 1990 show, originally a rap music show entitled ''The Rap Show'', was followed by an electronic music show hosted by [[Glenn Humplik]]. Through the proximity of their shows, Tom and Glenn met and became friends, based on a common love of zany antics. Tom's radio show soon shifted formats to a call-in show (upon the discovery of how to operate the studio's call-in lines){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and the two joined forces to host ''The Midnight Caller Show'' (which lasted from 1993 to 1996). The basic format of The Midnight Caller was to have listeners call-in with Tom and Glenn making fun of them (or \"razzing\" them) and soon after hanging-up on them. The show's novelty and originality made it an underground hit{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} in the Ottawa area.\n\n====Rapper====\nIn the early 1990s, Green had a short-lived career as a rapper in a group called [[Organized Rhyme]] under the alias \"[[MC Bones]]\". His fellow MCs included \"Pin the Chameleon\". The single \"Check The O.R.\" was nominated  for a [[Juno Award]] in [[Juno Awards of 1993#Best Rap Recording|1993 for Best Rap Recording]] and won the [[MuchVibe Best Rap Video (MMVA Award)|MuchVibe Best Rap Video]] award in 1992.\n\nIn 1998, ''[[Not The Green Tom Show]]'' was released by Green's alter-ego [[MC Face]]. The theme of the album revolves around MC Face, a pugnacious and foul-mouthed rapper who is constantly angry with and taking verbal jabs at Tom Green, his square producer who brings on some of his buddies from ''The Tom Green Show''.\n\n====''The Tom Green Show''====\n{{main|The Tom Green Show}}\nGreen soon had his own non-paid television show on [[public-access television]] on [[cable TV]]. The first incarnation of ''The Tom Green Show'' aired from September 1994 until 1996 as a one-hour no commercial public cable access program on [[Rogers Television|Rogers Television 22]] in the [[Ottawa]] region airing 50 episodes in two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|title=Tom Green Timeline|publisher=ottawacomedy.com|accessdate=2010-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424051157/http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|archive-date=2010-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Tom Green Show'' was a [[variety show]] format, where he would have guests visit the studio and bands play before a live audience. He also had taped segments that typically consisted of stunts played by Green on unsuspecting people. A number of them involved Green's parents, Richard and Mary Jane, who consistently appeared unamused and occasionally angered by Tom's antics.\nIn October 1996, ''The Tom Green Show'' aired one time as a pilot on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. The show was later picked up in Canada by [[The Comedy Network]] in 1997 and aired 26 episodes over the course of two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\"/>\n\n===Rise to mainstream (1999\u20132003)===\n\n====MTV and ''The Tom Green Show''====\n{{main|The Tom Green Show}}\n''The Tom Green Show'' was then picked up by [[MTV]] in January 1999, where he gained popularity in the United States and worldwide. The format of the MTV version of the show was similar to his original show; it was hosted by Green and co-hosted by two of his long-time friends, Glenn Humplik, who occupied the couch, and Phil Giroux, who sat behind a window at the back of the set and became known as \"the guy in the window\" usually drinking cups of coffee. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be unimpressed and embarrassed by their son's antics.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\"/>\n\n''The Tom Green Show'' was renowned for Green's version of [[shock humor]]. Some of Green's most notable skits include pretending to \"hump\" a dead [[moose]] (which was referenced by rapper [[Eminem]] in \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\"), having an [[X-rated]] lesbian scene  painted on his father's car (labeled the \"Slut Mobile\"), drinking milk by sucking on a cow's teat, and putting a cow head in his parents' bed while they slept because his father was a fan of ''[[The Godfather]]'' films. Green also hung his own unauthorized piece of art in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] (which remained untouched for days) with the added twist of later coming back and vandalizing it to the horror of onlooking patrons.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://entertainmentcentralpittsburgh.com/nightlife/tom-green/|title= Tom Green: Entertainment Renaissance Man|author=Rick Handler  |publisher= Entertainment Central|date = November 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a segment, Green went to the press conference of ''[[Grey Owl (film)|Grey Owl]]'' where he serenaded and kissed [[Pierce Brosnan]]. Brosnan, thinking Green was a [[journalist]], advised him not to give up his day job. Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green teased him about this often and once gave out Humplik's office phone number on the air.\n\nGreen eventually wrote a song called \"[[Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)]]\", which he composed during MTV's Spring Break while doing a show on a cruise ship. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and was also referred to in Eminem's song \"The Real Slim Shady\". He quickly called for the video to be retired because \"it's not fair to [[98 Degrees]].\" Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that ''Total Request Live'' was, in fact, a live request show (the next week's episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of \"The Bum Bum Song\" at the time).\n\nGreen's increasing fame made it harder for him to ambush people during [[Vox populi|man-on-the-street]] segments, leading him to target mostly [[old age|senior citizens]] and non-[[English language|English]] speakers. After he was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in March 2000, he stopped production of new episodes of his TV show but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. Green's popularity during this time led to him gracing the cover of the June 8, 2000 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.\n\nThe MTV show ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' debuted six months after ''The Tom Green Show'' went on hiatus. Many of the segments on the show had close similarities to the segments from Green's show: [[Bam Margera]] rudely awakening his parents, the cast of ''Jackass'' falling down while on crutches, swimming with sharks, etc.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://crujonessociety.com/2009/12/16/lee-s-harts-5-favorite-tv-shows-of-the-00s/\n| title      = Lee S.

Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, and there is no evidence to suggest that such an event occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/tomgreen.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Tom Green Hitler Bar Mitzvah |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, ''[[Hollywood Causes Cancer]]'', stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name \"Tom Green.\" Green says, \"I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that \u2013 it's both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, I've never even been to a Bar Mitzvah.\"\n\n====Film career====\nGreen's fame soon netted him roles in several Hollywood movies, including ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' (which he also wrote and directed), and ''[[Stealing Harvard]].'' Green continued the trend of his brand of comedy in ''Road Trip'' in a notable scene where he put a mouse in his mouth.\n\n''Freddy Got Fingered'' won in five categories at the [[2001 Golden Raspberry Awards]], given to the worst movies of the year. Green appeared at the ceremony to accept his awards, making him the first performer to do so in the award's twenty-year history, and the second recipient to do so following director [[Paul Verhoeven]] for ''[[Showgirls]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1889555.stm|title=Green gets fingered for Razzies|publisher=BBC News|last=Waters|first=Darren|date=March 23, 2002|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> Green arrived at the awards ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolled out his own red carpet.<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> After accepting the awards, Green stated \"When we set out to make this film we wanted to win a Razzie, so this is a dream come true for me\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> While onstage, he began to play the [[harmonica]] and did not stop until he was dragged off.\n\n====Marriage to Drew Barrymore and ''Saturday Night Live''====\nIn July 2000, Tom Green became engaged to actress [[Drew Barrymore]]. Green and Barrymore met after Barrymore, who was a fan of Green's show, asked Green to appear in ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', which Barrymore starred in and produced.

The most notable incident came on November 18, 2000, when Green hosted the American television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. During the [[monologue]], Green brought Barrymore on stage and teased the audience about the couple marrying at the end of the episode. Ultimately, the stage was set for a wedding before Barrymore, in the end, got \"cold feet\" and left Green alone to end the show. The SNL incident initially left viewers and the media confused about whether the couple had actually planned to marry on live TV, or were simply staging a publicity stunt. Eventually, Green also went on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' to toy with the public once again, this time claiming that his bride might be [[pregnancy|pregnant]].{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nBarrymore and Green filed for [[divorce]] on December 17, 2001, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].<ref name=\"divorce\">{{cite web|first=Jeanne|last=Darst|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|title=Tom Green Files for a Divorce from Drew|accessdate=2008-09-07|date=2001-12-18|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005070527/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|archivedate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Their divorce became official on October 15, 2002.<ref name=\"divorce\"/>\n\n====Return to MTV and ''The New Tom Green Show''====\nIn 2002, Green starred in and directed a one-hour MTV special called ''The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour'', where he tormented strangers in [[Japan]].

Green was a recurring contributor to ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''; doing many segments where he travels across America looking for \"interesting people\", typically bringing the most colourful person with him back to the studio. In these segments, the focus is more on the odd behavior of the interviewees, with Green generally playing the straight man.\n\n[[File:Tom Green and the Carpet Frogs Perform in Afghanistan 110308-A-UJ825-165.jpg|thumb|Green performing with the [[USO]] in Afghanistan, 2011]]\nIn 2003, Green visited troops in [[Kosovo]] on a [[USO]] tour.

In an October 2013 interview, Green stated that he preferred \"great interviewers who know when to sit back and listen\" rather than being an interviewer that \"wanted to be as funny as the guest and...get into a sort of competitive relationship with them\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetvpage.com/2013/10/17/interview-tom-green-eyes-miley-letterman-for-new-axs-talk-show/|title=Tom Green Eyes Miley, Letterman For New AXS Talk Show|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=2013-10-17|publisher=thetvpage.com}}</ref>\n\n====''Tomgreen.com: The Channel'' (2006\u20132011, 2015)====\n{{main|Tom Green's House Tonight}}\n[[File:Tom Green, Thora Birch and Neil Hamburger.jpg|thumb|left|Green, [[Thora Birch]], and [[Neil Hamburger]] at The Channel in 2006]]\nOn June 5, 2006, [[ManiaTV.com]] announced they had formed a partnership with Green to host a live talk show from his own living room in the [[Hollywood Hills]] overlooking the [[San Fernando Valley]]. The first show aired live on June 15, 2006 at 11&nbsp;pm EST, was originally called ''[[Tom Green Live!]]'', and was airing Mondays through Thursdays.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0813913|title=Tom Green Live}}</ref> In January 2008, shortly after Green's split from ManiaTV, the show was renamed ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]''. The shows are broadcast live at TomGreen.com. A pared-down version was later broadcast on [[The Comedy Network]] and various local channels in the United States, until Green stopped syndicating the show to television. On a 2009 blog, Green noted that he stopped his show from syndication on television due to dissatisfaction with his lack of creative control. He continues to broadcast the show from his website. Green later started a monthly subscription service that allowed subscribers to have full access to all the videos on his website.\n\nDue to lack of an established term, Green often refers to his live streaming broadcast as \"Web-o-Vision.\" He also jokingly says he is broadcasting to \"The National Internet\", despite the show having a worldwide audience. Green often refers to his show as, \"The highest rated, longest running, and only talk show on the Internet.\"\n\nFrom Green's website, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' typically aired live on weeknights at 10&nbsp;pm EST, although shows can begin at any time during the day and night. The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and [[Skype]] video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often be a victim of [[prank call]]s due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with the callers. On top of the live web show, Green has added many video segments from his past as well as present.\n\nIn 2007, \"Tom Green Live\" won the 2007 TV Guide \"Online Video Award\" for Best Web Talk Show. In 2008, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' won a 2007 [[Webby Award]] for \"Best Variety Show\".<ref name=\"webby\">{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|title=2007 Webby Award Winners|publisher=webbyawards.com|accessdate=2012-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020213400/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|archivedate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Green 2006 (141261244) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Green in 2006|right]]\n\nAs host of the show, Green often plays the straight man while interviewing guests. There have been hundreds of shows with many notable guests including stars such as [[Adam Carolla]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Thora Birch]], [[Pamela Anderson]], hip-hop artists [[Blackalicious]] and [[Xzibit]], skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]], former ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' host and talk show host [[Carson Daly]], guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], actor [[Crispin Glover]], [[Digg|Digg.com]] founder [[Kevin Rose]], comedic musician [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], as well as comedians [[Neil Hamburger]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Joe Rogan]], and [[Andy Dick]]. The longest standard format show, in which Green interviewed [[Steve-O]], ran for 3.5 hours and ended with Green drunk and Steve-O heavily [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]].\n\nWhen Green does not have guests, he has done many unconventional shows such as playing the saxophone for an hour, having a week dedicated to performing [[karaoke]], or updating the viewers about ''The Channel'' while taking telephone and Skype calls.\n\nOn his website, Green has talked about the substantial costs of continuing the online show and that ''The Channel'' may be gone in mid-2011 if it is not profitable by then. In 2011, Green ended the subscription service on his website and stated that his live show is on hiatus. Green also took down the TV studio that was in his living room.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Green brought back his web-o-vision show and hosts it daily from his studio in Burbank.\n\n===Tom Green Live at The SModcastle (2010)===\nFrom October \u2013 December 2010, Green did seven weekly podcasts interviewing guests at [[Kevin Smith]]'s [[Smodcastle#SModcastle|SModcastle]].
