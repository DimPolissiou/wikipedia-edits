These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.\n\n[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]<ref>Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.</ref> or had been assimilated into mainstream culture.

However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.\n\n===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===\nIn 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995).</ref> Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of \"anything goes\" and suggests that \u201cthe built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.\u201d<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 9.</ref> In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to \"embrace post-Postmodernism \u2013 and pray for a better name.\"<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]</ref>\n\n===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===\nIn his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  \"is ... part of a much larger historical formation,\" which he calls \"[[postmodernity]]\".<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.</ref> Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix \"[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]\":\n{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following \"postmodernism,\" one finds that the prefix \"trans\" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of \"post,\" which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as \"truth\" and \"objectivity,\" \"soul\" and \"subjectivity,\" \"utopia\" and \"ideality,\" \"primary origin\" and \"originality,\" \"sincerity\" and \"sentimentality.\" All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of \"trans-subjectivity,\" \"trans-idealism,\" \"trans-utopianism,\" \"trans-originality,\" \"trans-lyricism,\" \"trans-sentimentality\" etc.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}</ref>}} As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460</ref>\n\n===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===\nThe term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with \"victimary thinking,\" which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to \"non-victimary dialogue\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> that will \"diminish ... the amount of resentment in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''<ref>{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.<ref>For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.</ref>\n\n===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===\nIn his 2006 paper ''[[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]]'', the British scholar Alan Kirby formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls \"pseudo-modernism\".<ref name=\"philosophynow\">{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November\u2013December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: \"In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads.\"<ref name=\"philosophynow\" />\n\nPseudo-modernism's \"typical intellectual states\" are furthermore described as being \"ignorance, fanaticism and anxiety\" and it is said to produce a \"trance-like state\" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a \"silent autism\" superseding \"the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism.\" Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of \"pseudo-modernism\". As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, \"the drivel found ... on some [[Wikipedia]] pages\", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].<ref name=\"philosophynow\"/> In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].\n\n===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===\nIn 2010 the cultural theorists [[Timotheus Vermeulen]] and [[Robin van den Akker]] introduced the term [[metamodernism]] <ref name=\"journalofaestheticsandculture\">Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. \"[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]\", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture'' 2010.</ref> as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article \"Notes on Metamodernism\" they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the \"informed naivety\", \"pragmatic idealism\" and \"moderate fanaticism\" of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.\n\nThe prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to [[Plato]]'s ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Altermodern]]\n* [[Dogme 95]]\n* [[Excessivism]]\n* [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)]]\n* [[Kitsch movement]]\n* [[Maximalism]]\n* [[Metamodernism]]\n* [[Neo-minimalism]]\n* [[New Puritans]]\n* [[New Sincerity]]\n* [[New Urbanism]]\n* [[Post-irony]]\n* [[Post-truth]]\n* [[Pseudorealism]]\n* [[Radical Orthodoxy]]\n* [[Remodernism]]\n* [[Stuckism]]\n* [[Transmodernism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/authenticism# Post-post-modernism known as Authenticism]\n*[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411731 Essay by Alan Kirby on theories of post-postmodernism]\n*[http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html Essay by Mikhail Epstein on The Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130810001724/http://alanfkirby.com/Introduction.pdf Introduction to \"Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure Our Culture\" by Alan Kirby]\n*[http://www.prlog.org/10814800-patrick-jf-queres-new-novel-grognard-now-available-at-major-booksellers.html Post-postmodern novel by Patrick J.

Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to \"embrace post-Postmodernism \u2013 and pray for a better name.\"<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]</ref>\n\n===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===\nIn his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  \"is ... part of a much larger historical formation,\" which he calls \"[[postmodernity]]\".<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.</ref> Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix \"[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]\":\n{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following \"postmodernism,\" one finds that the prefix \"trans\" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of \"post,\" which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as \"truth\" and \"objectivity,\" \"soul\" and \"subjectivity,\" \"utopia\" and \"ideality,\" \"primary origin\" and \"originality,\" \"sincerity\" and \"sentimentality.\" All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of \"trans-subjectivity,\" \"trans-idealism,\" \"trans-utopianism,\" \"trans-originality,\" \"trans-lyricism,\" \"trans-sentimentality\" etc.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}</ref>}} As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka.

Gans associates postmodernism closely with \"victimary thinking,\" which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to \"non-victimary dialogue\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> that will \"diminish ... the amount of resentment in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''<ref>{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.<ref>For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.</ref>\n\n===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===\nIn his 2006 paper ''[[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]]'', the British scholar Alan Kirby formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls \"pseudo-modernism\".<ref name=\"philosophynow\">{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November\u2013December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: \"In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads.\"<ref name=\"philosophynow\" />\n\nPseudo-modernism's \"typical intellectual states\" are furthermore described as being \"ignorance, fanaticism and anxiety\" and it is said to produce a \"trance-like state\" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a \"silent autism\" superseding \"the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism.\" Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of \"pseudo-modernism\". As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, \"the drivel found ... on some [[Wikipedia]] pages\", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].<ref name=\"philosophynow\"/> In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].\n\n===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===\nIn 2010 the cultural theorists [[Timotheus Vermeulen]] and [[Robin van den Akker]] introduced the term [[metamodernism]] <ref name=\"journalofaestheticsandculture\">Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. \"[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]\", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture'' 2010.</ref> as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article \"Notes on Metamodernism\" they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the \"informed naivety\", \"pragmatic idealism\" and \"moderate fanaticism\" of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.\n\nThe prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to [[Plato]]'s ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Altermodern]]\n* [[Dogme 95]]\n* [[Excessivism]]\n* [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)]]\n* [[Kitsch movement]]\n* [[Maximalism]]\n* [[Metamodernism]]\n* [[Neo-minimalism]]\n* [[New Puritans]]\n* [[New Sincerity]]\n* [[New Urbanism]]\n* [[Post-irony]]\n* [[Post-truth]]\n* [[Pseudorealism]]\n* [[Radical Orthodoxy]]\n* [[Remodernism]]\n* [[Stuckism]]\n* [[Transmodernism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/authenticism# Post-post-modernism known as Authenticism]\n*[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411731 Essay by Alan Kirby on theories of post-postmodernism]\n*[http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html Essay by Mikhail Epstein on The Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130810001724/http://alanfkirby.com/Introduction.pdf Introduction to \"Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure Our Culture\" by Alan Kirby]\n*[http://www.prlog.org/10814800-patrick-jf-queres-new-novel-grognard-now-available-at-major-booksellers.html Post-postmodern novel by Patrick J.

It stars [[JoBeth Williams]], [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Heather O'Rourke]], and [[Beatrice Straight]] and is produced by Spielberg alongside [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]]. Set in a California suburb, the plot focuses on a family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that abduct their younger daughter, and the family's attempts to bring her back into the real world.\n\nA clause in Spielberg's contract prevented him from directing another film while he made ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. Therefore, Hooper was selected to direct based upon his work on ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse]]''. The film was first conceived as a dark horror sequel to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' entitled ''[[Night Skies]]''. When Spielberg approached Hooper to direct, Hooper was less keen on the sci-fi elements and suggested the idea of a [[ghost]] story.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S|title=Fangoria #23, Article \"Tobe Hooper on Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist\"|last=Martin|first=Bob|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S/page/n27 28]}}</ref> Spielberg and Hooper would then go on to collaborate on the first treatment for the film.\n\nReleased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 4, 1982, the film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the [[1982 in film#Highest-grossing films (U.S.)|eighth-highest-grossing film of 1982]]. Years since its release, the film has been recognized as a classic within the horror genre and has gained a [[cult film|cult following]]. Aside from being nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], ''Poltergeist'' was named by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] as the 20th-scariest film ever made, and the scene of the clown doll attack was ranked as #80 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml  |title= Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments |publisher=web.archive.org |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archivedate = October 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/hollywood/chicago-critics-scariest-films/ |title= Chicago Critics\u2019 Scariest Films |publisher=AltFilmGuide.com |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010}}</ref> The film also appeared at #84 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills|100 Years...100 Thrills]], a list of America's most heart-pounding movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/tvevents/pdf/thrills100.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe film's success helped spawn a franchise consisting of two sequels, ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' (1986), ''[[Poltergeist III]]'' (1988), and a [[Poltergeist (2015 film)|remake of the same name]] in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve and Diane Freeling live a quiet life in an Orange County, California, [[planned community]] called Cuesta Verde, where Steve is a successful real estate developer and Diane looks after their children Dana, Robbie, and Carol Anne. Carol Anne awakens one night and begins conversing with the family's television set, which is displaying static following a sign-off. The following night, while the Freelings sleep, Carol Anne fixates on the television set as it transmits static again. Suddenly, a ghostly white hand emerges from the television, after which there is a violent earthquake. As the shaking subsides, Carol Anne announces \"They're here\".\n\nBizarre events occur the following day: a drinking glass of milk spontaneously breaks, silverware bends, and furniture moves of its own accord. The phenomena seem [[benign]] at first, but quickly begin to intensify. That night, a gnarled backyard tree comes alive and grabs Robbie through the bedroom window. While Steve rescues Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked into a portal that appears in her closet. The Freelings realize something supernatural has occurred when they hear her voice emanating from the television set that is tuned to an empty channel.\n\nA group of parapsychologists from the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\u2014Dr. Lesh, Ryan, and Marty\u2014come to the Freeling house to investigate; they determine that the Freelings are experiencing a poltergeist intrusion. They discover that the disturbances involve more than just one ghost. Steve also finds out in an exchange with his boss, Lewis Teague, that Cuesta Verde is built where a cemetery was once located.\n\nAfter Dana and Robbie are sent away for their safety, Lesh and Ryan call in Tangina Barrons, a spiritual medium. Tangina states that the ghosts inhabiting the house are lingering in a different \"sphere of consciousness\" and are not at rest. Attracted to Carol Anne's life force, these spirits are distracted from the real \"light\" that has come for them. Tangina then adds that there is also a dark presence she refers to as the \"Beast\", who has Carol Anne under restraint in an effort to use her life force to prevent other spirits from crossing over.\n\nThe assembled group discovers that the entrance to the other dimension is through the children's bedroom closet, while the exit is through the living room ceiling. As the group attempts to rescue Carol Anne, Diane passes through the entrance tied by a rope that has been threaded through both portals. Diane manages to retrieve Carol Anne, and they both drop to the floor from the ceiling, unconscious and covered in ectoplasmic residue. As they recover, Tangina proclaims afterward that the house is now \"clean\".\n\nShortly thereafter, the Freelings begin the process of moving elsewhere by packing up their belongings. During their last night in the house, Steve leaves for the office in order to quit his job and Dana goes on a date, leaving Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne alone in the house. The \"Beast\" then ambushes Diane and the children, aiming for a second kidnapping by attempting to restrain Robbie and Diane. Robbie is attacked by a [[clown]] [[doll]] in his bedroom, and Diane is attacked by an unseen force that moves her up the wall and over the ceiling in her room. The unseen force drives Diane to the backyard, dragging her into the swimming pool. Skeletal corpses surround her as she tries to escape, but she manages to climb out of the pool and make her way back into the house. She rescues the children, and they eventually escape to the outside, only to discover coffins and rotting corpses erupting out from the ground in their yard and throughout the neighborhood.\n\nAs Steve and Dana return home to the mayhem, Steve confronts Teague after realizing that rather than relocating the cemetery for the development of Cuesta Verde, Teague merely had the headstones moved and the bodies left behind. The Freelings flee Cuesta Verde while the house implodes into the portal, to the astonishment of onlookers. The family checks into a hotel for the night, and Steve rolls the television outside into the walkway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Craig T.

As such a marketable name, some began to question Spielberg's role during production. Suggestions that Spielberg had greater directorial influence than the credits suggest were aided by his comments: \"Tobe isn't ... a take-charge sort of guy.

Tobe would nod agreement, and that became the process of collaboration.\"<ref name=\"Brode102\">Brode, pg 102</ref>\n\nThe [[Directors Guild of America]] \"opened an investigation into the question of whether or not Hooper's official credit was being denigrated by statements Spielberg has made, apparently claiming authorship.\" This was first reported in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article on May 24, 1982, the same article from which the above quote from Spielberg was first obtained.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pollack |first1=Dale |title='Poltergeist': Whose Film Is It? |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=May 24, 1982}}</ref> The investigation ended in an arbitrator's ruling that \"MGM/UA Entertainment Co. must pay $15,000 to director Tobe Hooper because the studio gave producer Steven Spielberg a bigger credit than Hooper got in its trailers,\" although also noting that \"broader issues of dispute exist between producer-writer (Spielberg) and the director\" (original damages of $200,000 were originally sought by the DGA).<ref>{{cite news |last=Searles |first=Jack |title=Hooper gets some recognition |agency=Los Angeles Herald Examiner |date=1982-06-19}}</ref> Co-producer [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that \"the creative force of the movie was Steven.

She said that \"Steven directed all six days\" that she was on set: \"Tobe set up the shots and Steven made the adjustments.\" She also alleged that Hooper \"allowed some unacceptable chemical agents into his work,\" and, when she went in to audition for Hooper and Spielberg, at that moment, that \"Tobe was only partially there.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Click over, children!

In response to the magazine's query about the authorship issue, cast members came unanimously on the side of Hooper. James Karen said, \"Tobe had a hard time on that film. It's tough when a producer is on set every day and there's always been a lot of talk about that. I considered Tobe my director. That's my stand on all those rumours.\" Martin Casella stated: \"So much of ''Poltergeist'' looks and feels like a Spielberg movie but my recollection is that Tobe was mostly directing.\" Oliver Robins: \"The guy who sets up the shots, blocks the actors and works with the crew to create a vision is the director. In those terms, Tobe was the director. He's the one who directed me, anyway.\" Make-up and effects man Craig Reardon stated Spielberg often had the final say, such as when his original version of the cancerous steak that he made in compliance with Hooper's specifications was ultimately vetoed by Spielberg: \"Although the first steak did not represent a killing amount of work, it had consumed enough time and effort\u2014none of which I could afford to waste\u2014that I determined in the future to make certain whatever I prepped would be approved in advance by Spielberg as well as Hooper.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Rue_Morgue_121_2012|title=Rue Morgue 121 (2012)}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of principal photography in the first week of August 1981, Hooper went on to spend ten weeks in the editing room putting together the first cut of the film.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6hmQbfOeTAC&q|title=Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology|last=Sanello|first=Frank|date=2002-08-05|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|year=|isbn=9780878331482|location=|page=119|language=en}}</ref>  Spielberg spent much of this time supervising the SFX photography being held at ILM.\n\nAccording to the [[Blumhouse Productions]] website, ''Poltergeist'' 1st assistant camera [[John R.

Steven developed the movie, and it was his to direct, except there was anticipation of a director's strike, so he was 'the producer' but really he directed it in case there was going to be a strike and Tobe was cool with that.

Tobe had been deeply involved in all of the pre-production and everything. But Steven is a guy who will come in and call the shots. And so, you're on your first studio film, hired by Steven Spielberg, who is enthusiastically involved in this movie. Are you gonna say, 'Stop that... let me do this'? Which [Tobe] did.\n\n[...] Tobe was a terrific filmmaker. I don't think it's that Steven was controlling. I think it was Steven was enthusiastic. And nobody was there to protect Tobe. But all of the pre-production was done by Tobe. Tobe was there throughout. Tobe's vision is very much realized there. And Tobe got credit because he deserved credit. Including... Steven Spielberg said that.\n\n[...] Yes, Steven Spielberg was very much involved.

This event also included the documentary \"They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists\", which was created for the new DVD.\n\nThe ''Poltergeist'' franchise is believed by some to be [[Poltergeist (film series)#The Poltergeist curse|cursed]] due to the premature deaths of several people associated with the film,<ref name=Snopes>Mikkelson, Barbara.

True Hollywood Story]]''.\n\n==Sequels and remakes==\nIn 1986, ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' retained the family but introduced a new motive for the Beast's behavior, tying him to an evil cult leader named Henry Kane, who led his religious sect to their doom in the 1820s. As the Beast, Kane went to extraordinary lengths to keep his \"flock\" under his control, even in death. The original motive of the cemetery's souls disturbed by the housing development was thereby altered; the cemetery was now explained to be built above a cave where Kane and his flock met their ends.  It also reveals that the women of the family are actually psychics.\n\n''[[Poltergeist III]]'' in 1988 finds Carol Anne as the sole original family member living in an elaborate Chicago skyscraper owned and inhabited by her aunt, uncle and cousin. Kane follows her there and uses the building's ubiquitous decorative mirrors as a portal to the Earthly plane.\n\nA remake of the original film was made by MGM and [[20th Century Fox]], directed by [[Gil Kenan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/06/mgm-fox-2000-to-co-finance-production-to-start-this-fall|title=MGM, Fox 2000 To Co-Finance & Distribute \u2018Poltergeist\u2019; Production To Start This Fall|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=June 20, 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=\u2018Poltergeist\u2019 Reboot Set For Late-Summer Start|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-set-for-late-summer-start-1200005032/|newspaper=Variety|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://collider.com/poltergeist-remake-filming-this-fall-release-2014/ | title = POLTERGEIST Remake Confirmed to Shoot This Fall; Likely Due out Next Year | first = Matt | last = Goldberg | accessdate = 2013-06-20 | publisher = Collider.com }}</ref> [[Sam Raimi]], [[Rob Tapert]], and [[Roy Lee]] produced the film, which stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Jared Harris]], and [[Rosemarie DeWitt]].<ref name=\"R\"/> ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]'' was released on May 22, 2015.<ref name=\"R\">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-release-date-spy-release-date-melissa-mccarthy-1201447391/|title=\u2018Poltergeist\u2019 Reboot Moved Up to May 22, \u2018Spy\u2019 Back to June 5|author=Dave McNary|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 10, 2019, it was announced that the [[Russo brothers|Russo Brothers]] would helm a new remake.<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3555052/poltergeist-getting-remade-captain-america-avengers-directors/</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Poltergeist'' was released on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], and [[LaserDisc]] in 1982.

In the book, Marty is frozen in place and is skeletonized by spiders and rats. There are also additional elements not in the film, such as Robbie's mysterious discovery of the clown doll in the yard during his birthday party, and a benevolent spirit, \"The Waiting Woman\", who protects Carol Anne in the spirit world.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Shining\" by [[horror punk]] band [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], on their 1997 album ''[[American Psycho (album)|American Psycho]]'', is based directly on the film, with the chorus centered on the refrain: \"Carol Anne, Carol Anne\".<ref>Greene, James R., Jr. (2013).

It stars [[JoBeth Williams]], [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Heather O'Rourke]], and [[Beatrice Straight]] and is produced by Spielberg alongside [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]]. Set in a California suburb, the plot focuses on a family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that abduct their younger daughter, and the family's attempts to bring her back into the real world.\n\nA clause in Spielberg's contract prevented him from directing another film while he made ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. Therefore, Hooper was selected to direct based upon his work on ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse]]''. The film was first conceived as a dark horror sequel to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' entitled ''[[Night Skies]]''. When Spielberg approached Hooper to direct, Hooper was less keen on the sci-fi elements and suggested the idea of a [[ghost]] story.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S|title=Fangoria #23, Article \"Tobe Hooper on Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist\"|last=Martin|first=Bob|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S/page/n27 28]}}</ref> Spielberg and Hooper would then go on to collaborate on the first treatment for the film.\n\nReleased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 4, 1982, the film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the [[1982 in film#Highest-grossing films (U.S.)|eighth-highest-grossing film of 1982]]. Years since its release, the film has been recognized as a classic within the horror genre and has gained a [[cult film|cult following]]. Aside from being nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], ''Poltergeist'' was named by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] as the 20th-scariest film ever made, and the scene of the clown doll attack was ranked as #80 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml  |title= Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments |publisher=web.archive.org |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archivedate = October 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/hollywood/chicago-critics-scariest-films/ |title= Chicago Critics\u2019 Scariest Films |publisher=AltFilmGuide.com |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010}}</ref> The film also appeared at #84 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills|100 Years...100 Thrills]], a list of America's most heart-pounding movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/tvevents/pdf/thrills100.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |accessdate= May 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe film's success helped spawn a franchise consisting of two sequels, ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' (1986), ''[[Poltergeist III]]'' (1988), and a [[Poltergeist (2015 film)|remake of the same name]] in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve and Diane Freeling live a quiet life in an Orange County, California, [[planned community]] called Cuesta Verde, where Steve is a successful real estate developer and Diane looks after their children Dana, Robbie, and Carol Anne. Carol Anne awakens one night and begins conversing with the family's television set, which is displaying static following a sign-off. The following night, while the Freelings sleep, Carol Anne fixates on the television set as it transmits static again. Suddenly, a ghostly white hand emerges from the television, after which there is a violent earthquake. As the shaking subsides, Carol Anne announces \"They're here\".\n\nBizarre events occur the following day: a drinking glass of milk spontaneously breaks, silverware bends, and furniture moves of its own accord. The phenomena seem [[benign]] at first, but quickly begin to intensify. That night, a gnarled backyard tree comes alive and grabs Robbie through the bedroom window. While Steve rescues Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked into a portal that appears in her closet. The Freelings realize something supernatural has occurred when they hear her voice emanating from the television set that is tuned to an empty channel.\n\nA group of parapsychologists from the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\u2014Dr. Lesh, Ryan, and Marty\u2014come to the Freeling house to investigate; they determine that the Freelings are experiencing a poltergeist intrusion. They discover that the disturbances involve more than just one ghost. Steve also finds out in an exchange with his boss, Lewis Teague, that Cuesta Verde is built where a cemetery was once located.\n\nAfter Dana and Robbie are sent away for their safety, Lesh and Ryan call in Tangina Barrons, a spiritual medium. Tangina states that the ghosts inhabiting the house are lingering in a different \"sphere of consciousness\" and are not at rest. Attracted to Carol Anne's life force, these spirits are distracted from the real \"light\" that has come for them. Tangina then adds that there is also a dark presence she refers to as the \"Beast\", who has Carol Anne under restraint in an effort to use her life force to prevent other spirits from crossing over.\n\nThe assembled group discovers that the entrance to the other dimension is through the children's bedroom closet, while the exit is through the living room ceiling. As the group attempts to rescue Carol Anne, Diane passes through the entrance tied by a rope that has been threaded through both portals. Diane manages to retrieve Carol Anne, and they both drop to the floor from the ceiling, unconscious and covered in ectoplasmic residue. As they recover, Tangina proclaims afterward that the house is now \"clean\".\n\nShortly thereafter, the Freelings begin the process of moving elsewhere by packing up their belongings. During their last night in the house, Steve leaves for the office in order to quit his job and Dana goes on a date, leaving Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne alone in the house. The \"Beast\" then ambushes Diane and the children, aiming for a second kidnapping by attempting to restrain Robbie and Diane. Robbie is attacked by a [[clown]] [[doll]] in his bedroom, and Diane is attacked by an unseen force that moves her up the wall and over the ceiling in her room. The unseen force drives Diane to the backyard, dragging her into the swimming pool. Skeletal corpses surround her as she tries to escape, but she manages to climb out of the pool and make her way back into the house. She rescues the children, and they eventually escape to the outside, only to discover coffins and rotting corpses erupting out from the ground in their yard and throughout the neighborhood.\n\nAs Steve and Dana return home to the mayhem, Steve confronts Teague after realizing that rather than relocating the cemetery for the development of Cuesta Verde, Teague merely had the headstones moved and the bodies left behind. The Freelings flee Cuesta Verde while the house implodes into the portal, to the astonishment of onlookers. The family checks into a hotel for the night, and Steve rolls the television outside into the walkway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Craig T.

As such a marketable name, some began to question Spielberg's role during production. Suggestions that Spielberg had greater directorial influence than the credits suggest were aided by his comments: \"Tobe isn't ... a take-charge sort of guy. If a question was asked and an answer wasn't immediately forthcoming, I'd jump in and say what we could do. Tobe would nod agreement, and that became the process of collaboration.\"<ref name=\"Brode102\">Brode, pg 102</ref>\n\nThe [[Directors Guild of America]] \"opened an investigation into the question of whether or not Hooper's official credit was being denigrated by statements Spielberg has made, apparently claiming authorship.\" This was first reported in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article on May 24, 1982, the same article from which the above quote from Spielberg was first obtained.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pollack |first1=Dale |title='Poltergeist': Whose Film Is It? |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=May 24, 1982}}</ref> The investigation ended in an arbitrator's ruling that \"MGM/UA Entertainment Co. must pay $15,000 to director Tobe Hooper because the studio gave producer Steven Spielberg a bigger credit than Hooper got in its trailers,\" although also noting that \"broader issues of dispute exist between producer-writer (Spielberg) and the director\" (original damages of $200,000 were originally sought by the DGA).<ref>{{cite news |last=Searles |first=Jack |title=Hooper gets some recognition |agency=Los Angeles Herald Examiner |date=1982-06-19}}</ref> Co-producer [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that \"the creative force of the movie was Steven.

But Steven did the design for every storyboard and he was on the set every day except for three days when he was in Hawaii with Lucas.\" However, Hooper stated that he \"did fully half of the storyboards.\"<ref name=\"Brode101\"/>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' printed an [[open letter]] from Spielberg to Hooper in the week of the film's release.\n\n<blockquote>Regrettably, some of the press has misunderstood the rather unique, creative relationship which you and I shared throughout the making of ''Poltergeist''.\nI enjoyed your openness in allowing me, as a writer and a producer, a wide berth for creative involvement, just as I know you were happy with the freedom you had to direct ''Poltergeist'' so wonderfully.\nThrough the screenplay you accepted a vision of this very intense movie from the start, and as the director, you delivered the goods. You performed responsibly and professionally throughout, and I wish you great success on your next project.<ref name=\"Brode99\">Brode, pg 99\u2013100</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 interview with ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'', Rubinstein discussed her recollections of the shooting process. She said that \"Steven directed all six days\" that she was on set: \"Tobe set up the shots and Steven made the adjustments.\" She also alleged that Hooper \"allowed some unacceptable chemical agents into his work,\" and, when she went in to audition for Hooper and Spielberg, at that moment, that \"Tobe was only partially there.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Click over, children!

In response to the magazine's query about the authorship issue, cast members came unanimously on the side of Hooper. James Karen said, \"Tobe had a hard time on that film. It's tough when a producer is on set every day and there's always been a lot of talk about that. I considered Tobe my director. That's my stand on all those rumours.\" Martin Casella stated: \"So much of ''Poltergeist'' looks and feels like a Spielberg movie but my recollection is that Tobe was mostly directing.\" Oliver Robins: \"The guy who sets up the shots, blocks the actors and works with the crew to create a vision is the director. In those terms, Tobe was the director. He's the one who directed me, anyway.\" Make-up and effects man Craig Reardon stated Spielberg often had the final say, such as when his original version of the cancerous steak that he made in compliance with Hooper's specifications was ultimately vetoed by Spielberg: \"Although the first steak did not represent a killing amount of work, it had consumed enough time and effort\u2014none of which I could afford to waste\u2014that I determined in the future to make certain whatever I prepped would be approved in advance by Spielberg as well as Hooper.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Rue_Morgue_121_2012|title=Rue Morgue 121 (2012)}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of principal photography in the first week of August 1981, Hooper went on to spend ten weeks in the editing room putting together the first cut of the film.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6hmQbfOeTAC&q|title=Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology|last=Sanello|first=Frank|date=2002-08-05|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|year=|isbn=9780878331482|location=|page=119|language=en}}</ref>  Spielberg spent much of this time supervising the SFX photography being held at ILM.\n\nAccording to the [[Blumhouse Productions]] website, ''Poltergeist'' 1st assistant camera [[John R. Leonetti]] reported that Spielberg directed the film more so than Hooper, stating, \"Hooper was so nice and just happy to be there. He creatively had input. Steven developed the movie, and it was his to direct, except there was anticipation of a director's strike, so he was 'the producer' but really he directed it in case there was going to be a strike and Tobe was cool with that. It wasn't anything against Tobe. Every once in a while, he would actually leave the set and let Tobe do a few things just because. But really, Steven directed it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/07/14/confirmation-who-really-directed-poltergeist/|title=Confirmation?

Tobe had been deeply involved in all of the pre-production and everything. But Steven is a guy who will come in and call the shots. And so, you're on your first studio film, hired by Steven Spielberg, who is enthusiastically involved in this movie. Are you gonna say, 'Stop that... let me do this'? Which [Tobe] did.\n\n[...] Tobe was a terrific filmmaker. I don't think it's that Steven was controlling. I think it was Steven was enthusiastic. And nobody was there to protect Tobe. But all of the pre-production was done by Tobe. Tobe was there throughout. Tobe's vision is very much realized there. And Tobe got credit because he deserved credit. Including... Steven Spielberg said that.\n\n[...] Yes, Steven Spielberg was very much involved.

It was shown in theaters for one night only on October 4, 2007 to promote the new restored and remastered 25th-anniversary DVD, released five days later. This event also included the documentary \"They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists\", which was created for the new DVD.\n\nThe ''Poltergeist'' franchise is believed by some to be [[Poltergeist (film series)#The Poltergeist curse|cursed]] due to the premature deaths of several people associated with the film,<ref name=Snopes>Mikkelson, Barbara. [http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/polter.htm \"Poltergeist Deaths\"], [[Snopes.com]], August 17, 2007</ref> a notion that was the focus of an ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''.\n\n==Sequels and remakes==\nIn 1986, ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' retained the family but introduced a new motive for the Beast's behavior, tying him to an evil cult leader named Henry Kane, who led his religious sect to their doom in the 1820s. As the Beast, Kane went to extraordinary lengths to keep his \"flock\" under his control, even in death. The original motive of the cemetery's souls disturbed by the housing development was thereby altered; the cemetery was now explained to be built above a cave where Kane and his flock met their ends.  It also reveals that the women of the family are actually psychics.\n\n''[[Poltergeist III]]'' in 1988 finds Carol Anne as the sole original family member living in an elaborate Chicago skyscraper owned and inhabited by her aunt, uncle and cousin. Kane follows her there and uses the building's ubiquitous decorative mirrors as a portal to the Earthly plane.\n\nA remake of the original film was made by MGM and [[20th Century Fox]], directed by [[Gil Kenan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/06/mgm-fox-2000-to-co-finance-production-to-start-this-fall|title=MGM, Fox 2000 To Co-Finance & Distribute \u2018Poltergeist\u2019; Production To Start This Fall|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=June 20, 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=\u2018Poltergeist\u2019 Reboot Set For Late-Summer Start|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-set-for-late-summer-start-1200005032/|newspaper=Variety|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://collider.com/poltergeist-remake-filming-this-fall-release-2014/ | title = POLTERGEIST Remake Confirmed to Shoot This Fall; Likely Due out Next Year | first = Matt | last = Goldberg | accessdate = 2013-06-20 | publisher = Collider.com }}</ref> [[Sam Raimi]], [[Rob Tapert]], and [[Roy Lee]] produced the film, which stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Jared Harris]], and [[Rosemarie DeWitt]].<ref name=\"R\"/> ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]'' was released on May 22, 2015.<ref name=\"R\">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-release-date-spy-release-date-melissa-mccarthy-1201447391/|title=\u2018Poltergeist\u2019 Reboot Moved Up to May 22, \u2018Spy\u2019 Back to June 5|author=Dave McNary|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 10, 2019, it was announced that the [[Russo brothers|Russo Brothers]] would helm a new remake.<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3555052/poltergeist-getting-remade-captain-america-avengers-directors/</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Poltergeist'' was released on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], and [[LaserDisc]] in 1982.

The novel also expands upon many scenes that took place in the film, such as the Freelings' living room being visited by night by outer-dimensional entities of fire and shadows, and an extended version of the kitchen scene in which Marty watches the steak crawl across a countertop. In the book, Marty is frozen in place and is skeletonized by spiders and rats. There are also additional elements not in the film, such as Robbie's mysterious discovery of the clown doll in the yard during his birthday party, and a benevolent spirit, \"The Waiting Woman\", who protects Carol Anne in the spirit world.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Shining\" by [[horror punk]] band [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], on their 1997 album ''[[American Psycho (album)|American Psycho]]'', is based directly on the film, with the chorus centered on the refrain: \"Carol Anne, Carol Anne\".<ref>Greene, James R., Jr. (2013).

The 2006 ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Petergeist]]\" parodies ''Poltergeist''. While attempting to build a multiplex in his backyard, Peter discovers an Indian burial ground. When he takes an Indian chief's skull, a poltergeist invades the Griffins' home.

Set in the rural [[Western United States|American West]], a small-town orphanage struggles to become self-supporting through its 4-H Club projects. The screenplay, written by Dorrell McGowan and Stuart E. McGowan, is based on a story concept by Robert T. Shannon. Released 6 October 1940, the film stars Mary Lee, Harry Cheshire, Rufe Davis, June Storey, Ralph Bowman, Joan Woodbury, Jed Prouty, Victor Kilian, and Isabel Randolph.\n\n==Plot==\nPappy Cheshire, his assistant Louise Dale, and farmhand Bucksaw Beechwood manage an orphanage near the village of Farmdale. Pappy has loaned $5000 of community provided orphanage funding to the orphans for their new 4-H Club projects so the orphanage will become self-supporting. Of the opinion this is a ridiculous idea, community leaders Hiram Crabtree, Sam Spitz, and Mrs. Uppington pressure Pappy to return the money within 30 days.\n\nHearing on the radio that Pappy's long lost brother, Henry, died and left Pappy $20,000, Bubbles Martin, one of the teenage orphan girls, tells Pappy about his good fortune, part of which turns out to be a nightclub, The Peep Inn, that Pappy and Bubbles visit in the city. Pappy plans to close the place, sell the building, and use the proceeds for the orphanage. He approaches The Peep Inn's group of musicians, girl dancers, and their director, Jeff Hill, to settle their contract at 50 cents on the dollar for their release. The entertainers refuse the offer and Pappy insists they get on the train and come to Farmdale to work for him for the remainder of their contract.\n\nWhen Jeff Hill and troupe arrive at the orphanage, Jeff is immediately smitten with Louise but she gives him the cold shoulder. Receiving a check for only $900 from his brother's estate after taxes and expenses, Pappy is unable to pay the community back. Jeff wants to put on a show, \"The Barnyard Follies\", to earn enough money to solve the financial problem but Dolly and the other girl dancers quit when they learn of the plan. Bubbles gets the orphans to do the show with the help of Jeff.\n\nThe Fire Inspector prevents the show from taking place. Under the pressure of Hiram and Sam, Pappy Cheshire leaves the orphanage. When the haystack goes up in flames the Fire Department comes. As the Fire Department begins to leave, one of the fire trucks gets stuck on the bridge in the driveway at the orphanage.  With the entire Fire Department now at the orphanage waiting for the fire truck to be freed, the Mayor of Farmdale allows the show to proceed. Pappy returns when he hears on the radio that the orphan's 4-H Club animals are going to be auctioned off. Mrs. Uppington accuses Hiram Crabtree and Sam Spitz of political graft as their motive for driving Pappy Cheshire to leave. Hiram and Sam flee the scene. All ends well and Jeff and Louise are arm in arm by the end of the movie.  \n\nLots of fun, good story, great music and dancing, enjoyable by people of all ages.\n\n==Cast==\n''Barnyard Follies'' cast as presented in the screen credits:\n*[[Mary Lee (actress)|Mary Lee]] (Mary Lee Wooters) as Bubbles Martin\nwith\n*[[Rufe Davis]] (Rufus Davidson) as Bucksaw Beechwood\n*[[June Storey]] as Louise Dale\n*[[Jed Prouty]] as Sam Spitz\n*[[Victor Kilian]] as Hiram Crabtree\n*[[Joan Woodbury]] as Dolly\n*\"Alfalfa\" Switzer ([[Carl Switzer]]) as Alfalfa\n*[[Robert Homans]] as Fire Inspector\n*Dorothy Harrison as Queen of Dairyland\nand Radio's Popular Entertainers\n*\"Pappy\" Cheshire ([[Harry Cheshire]]) as Pappy Cheshire\n*The Cackle Sisters (Mary Jane and Carolyn DeZurik, a.k.a.

Lucenay's first generation \"Pete the Pup\", named Pal the Wonder Dog, with a natural ring around his right eye, debuted as \"Tige\" in 1925 in the ''[[Buster Brown]]'' [[two-reeler]] series, later moving to the ''Our Gang'' series, and died in 1930 of apparent poisoning. With the loss of Pal the Wonder Dog, Lucenay's Peter debuted in ''[[Pups is Pups]]'' (1930). His last ''Our Gang'' appearance was in ''[[The Pooch]]'' (1932) after which time various other unrelated dogs were used in the series as a result of Lucenay and Roach having parted ways. Lucenary's Peter died of old age in 1946.

Set in the rural [[Western United States|American West]], a small-town orphanage struggles to become self-supporting through its 4-H Club projects. The screenplay, written by Dorrell McGowan and Stuart E. McGowan, is based on a story concept by Robert T. Shannon. Released 6 October 1940, the film stars Mary Lee, Harry Cheshire, Rufe Davis, June Storey, Ralph Bowman, Joan Woodbury, Jed Prouty, Victor Kilian, and Isabel Randolph.\n\n==Plot==\nPappy Cheshire, his assistant Louise Dale, and farmhand Bucksaw Beechwood manage an orphanage near the village of Farmdale. Pappy has loaned $5000 of community provided orphanage funding to the orphans for their new 4-H Club projects so the orphanage will become self-supporting. Of the opinion this is a ridiculous idea, community leaders Hiram Crabtree, Sam Spitz, and Mrs. Uppington pressure Pappy to return the money within 30 days.\n\nHearing on the radio that Pappy's long lost brother, Henry, died and left Pappy $20,000, Bubbles Martin, one of the teenage orphan girls, tells Pappy about his good fortune, part of which turns out to be a nightclub, The Peep Inn, that Pappy and Bubbles visit in the city. Pappy plans to close the place, sell the building, and use the proceeds for the orphanage. He approaches The Peep Inn's group of musicians, girl dancers, and their director, Jeff Hill, to settle their contract at 50 cents on the dollar for their release. The entertainers refuse the offer and Pappy insists they get on the train and come to Farmdale to work for him for the remainder of their contract.\n\nWhen Jeff Hill and troupe arrive at the orphanage, Jeff is immediately smitten with Louise but she gives him the cold shoulder. Receiving a check for only $900 from his brother's estate after taxes and expenses, Pappy is unable to pay the community back. Jeff wants to put on a show, \"The Barnyard Follies\", to earn enough money to solve the financial problem but Dolly and the other girl dancers quit when they learn of the plan. Bubbles gets the orphans to do the show with the help of Jeff.\n\nThe Fire Inspector prevents the show from taking place. Under the pressure of Hiram and Sam, Pappy Cheshire leaves the orphanage. When the haystack goes up in flames the Fire Department comes. As the Fire Department begins to leave, one of the fire trucks gets stuck on the bridge in the driveway at the orphanage.  With the entire Fire Department now at the orphanage waiting for the fire truck to be freed, the Mayor of Farmdale allows the show to proceed. Pappy returns when he hears on the radio that the orphan's 4-H Club animals are going to be auctioned off. Mrs. Uppington accuses Hiram Crabtree and Sam Spitz of political graft as their motive for driving Pappy Cheshire to leave. Hiram and Sam flee the scene. All ends well and Jeff and Louise are arm in arm by the end of the movie.  \n\nLots of fun, good story, great music and dancing, enjoyable by people of all ages.\n\n==Cast==\n''Barnyard Follies'' cast as presented in the screen credits:\n*[[Mary Lee (actress)|Mary Lee]] (Mary Lee Wooters) as Bubbles Martin\nwith\n*[[Rufe Davis]] (Rufus Davidson) as Bucksaw Beechwood\n*[[June Storey]] as Louise Dale\n*[[Jed Prouty]] as Sam Spitz\n*[[Victor Kilian]] as Hiram Crabtree\n*[[Joan Woodbury]] as Dolly\n*\"Alfalfa\" Switzer ([[Carl Switzer]]) as Alfalfa\n*[[Robert Homans]] as Fire Inspector\n*Dorothy Harrison as Queen of Dairyland\nand Radio's Popular Entertainers\n*\"Pappy\" Cheshire ([[Harry Cheshire]]) as Pappy Cheshire\n*The Cackle Sisters (Mary Jane and Carolyn DeZurik, a.k.a.

In late 1938, they recorded six sides for the [[American Record Corporation]] which issued on the [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]] and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] record labels as the DeZurik Sisters.<ref>Abrams, Steven and Tyrone Settlemier, The Online Discographical Project, DeZurik Sisters, Conqueror 9251, 9252, 9253,<http://www.78discography.com/Conq9000.htm> (Click on the link to view.)</ref><ref>Abrams, Steven and Tyrone Settlemier, The Online Discographical Project, DeZurik Sisters, Vocalion 4616, 4704, 4781,<http://78discography.com/VOC4500.htm> (Click on the link to view.)</ref> On the Purina Mills ''Checkerboard Time'' radio show, in ''Barnyard Follies'', at the [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, and elsewhere they were known as The Cackle Sisters.\n\n[[Isabel Randolph]] is remembered for her character role as \"Mrs. Uppington\" in the Fibber McGee and Molly radio series from 1936 through 1943 which she carried over to four films from 1940 through 1943.<ref>IMDb, Isabel Randolph, Biography, <https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0709902/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm> (Click on the link to view.)</ref><ref>IMDb, Isabel Randolph, Filmography, <https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0709902/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1> (Click on the link to view.)</ref> In ''Barnyard Follies'' she is identified as \"Uppy\" by Pappy Cheshire (Harry Cheshire) at 05:25 and as \"Mrs. Uppington\" by Louise Dale (June Storey) at 16:34.\n\nSeen with the basket of laundry in ''Barnyard follies'', [[Lillian Randolph]] (uncredited) also appeared in the opening scene at 3:25. Born Castello Randolph in 1898, she came to Hollywood in 1934 from WXYZ radio Detroit and enjoyed a long career in motion pictures, radio, and television as a character actor.\n\nThe role of the Mayor of Farmdale is played by actor and writer [[Bob McKenzie (actor)|Robert McKenzie]] (uncredited) who appeared in more than 300 films. Married to actress [[Eva McKenzie|Eva Heazlitt McKenzie]], their two daughters and a niece were also actors. We remember their youngest daughter [[Fay McKenzie]] as the leading lady in five Gene Autry films from October 1941 through April 1942.<ref>IMDb, Robert McKenzie, Biography, <https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571602/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm> (Click on the link to view.)</ref><ref>Western Clippings, Mike Fitzgerald, An Interview with Fay McKenzie, <http://www.westernclippings.com/interview/faymckenzie_interview.shtml> (Click on the link to view.)</ref>\n\n''Barnyard Follies'' drew on cast members who had been recently dropped from Hal Roach's ''[[Our Gang]]'' series of comedy shorts. Most prominent in the film was [[Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer]] where he demonstrates his ability to yodel off-key.\n\n[[Darwood Kaye]] (uncredited), known for his role of Waldo from 1937 into 1940 in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series, is identified as \"Waldo\" by Pappy Cheshire (Harry Cheshire) at 4:50. He is found in a number of scenes in ''Barnyard Follies'' with his trademark large, round, black horn-rimmed spectacles. Born Darwood Kenneth Smith in 1929, after graduating from Hollywood High School in 1946<ref>Darwood Smith, W'46 Poinsettia, Hollywood High School, winter 1946, p. 9, bottom row, 4th from left, http://www.classmates.com/siteui/yearbooks/132983?page=11 (Click on the link to view.)</ref> he served in the army, then went on to La Sierra University, and eventually became a Seventh-day Adventist pastor. His life story is told in the biography \"Finding Waldo\".<ref>Smith, David B., \"Finding Waldo\", Pacific Press Publishing Association, Nampa, Idaho, 2009</ref>\n\nEugene \"Porky\" Lee (uncredited) from ''Our Gang'', seen sitting between Mary Lee and Darwood Kaye at 16:15, is identified by Jeff Hill (Ralph Bowman) at 38:55. By early 1939 Lee had outgrown his \"Porky\" role in the ''Our Gang'' series. Later known as [[Eugene Gordon Lee]], he became an alternative school teacher at [[Broomfield High School]] in Colorado.\n\n[[File:Pete_the_Pup_in_Barnyard_Follies.jpg|thumb|260px|left| ''Barnyard Follies'' at 3:19 - Lucenay's Peter and unidentified boy. (Click on the image to enlarge.)]]\n\nThe dog, Lucenay's Peter (uncredited), seen in ''Barnyard Follies'' was the second generation \"[[Pete the Pup]]\" from [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'' series and is identified in the haystack scene at 25:25 as \"Pete\" by Bubbles (Mary Lee). Born 6 September 1929, owned and trained by Harry S. Lucenay (1887-1944), Lucenay's Peter was AKC and UKC registered as an [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]<ref>Lucenay's Peter, UKC 022-558, APBT-Online, <http://www.apbt.online-pedigrees.com/modules.php?name=Public&file=printPedigree&dog_id=67627> (Click on the link to view.)</ref> and had a ring painted around his left eye. Lucenay's first generation \"Pete the Pup\", named Pal the Wonder Dog, with a natural ring around his right eye, debuted as \"Tige\" in 1925 in the ''[[Buster Brown]]'' [[two-reeler]] series, later moving to the ''Our Gang'' series, and died in 1930 of apparent poisoning. With the loss of Pal the Wonder Dog, Lucenay's Peter debuted in ''[[Pups is Pups]]'' (1930). His last ''Our Gang'' appearance was in ''[[The Pooch]]'' (1932) after which time various other unrelated dogs were used in the series as a result of Lucenay and Roach having parted ways. Lucenary's Peter died of old age in 1946. Theodore Lucenay (1925-2004), son of Harry, remembered Pete in an interview in 2001 for the ''[[Waco Tribune-Herald]]'': \"He was a gentle, playful and warm dog. He would sleep at the foot of my bed. He was just the regular family dog. I really miss him.\"<ref>Minor, Christina, \"Pooch Pete still alive to fans of Our Gang\", Waco Tribune-Herald, Waco, Texas, 9 April 2001, <http://nokillnow.com/PitBullPetey.html> (Click on the link and scroll down the page to view the article by Christina Minor.
