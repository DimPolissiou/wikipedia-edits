It was shortlisted for both the 2006 [[Man Booker Prize]] and the 2006 [[Orange Prize]]. The novel, which is [[Reverse chronology|told backward]] through third-person narrative, takes place in 1940s London during and after [[World War II]]. The storyline follows the fragmented lives and the strange interconnections between Kay, Helen and Julia, three lesbians; Viv, a straight woman; and Duncan, her brother, whose sexuality is ambiguous. The war, with its never-ending night watches, serves as a horrifying context, backdrop and metaphor as a constant reminder of the morbidity that surrounds life and love.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Plot|date=November 2008}}\n\n===1947===\n'''Kay'''\n\nThe novel begins with Kay Langrish-a woman broken by the war. She spends her days locked in her room in London, watching her landlord's patients arrive and leave at precisely the same hours every day.   The only human contact that Kay is seen to be having at this stage in the narrative is with another lesbian, Mickey.  Kay is suggested to be wealthy by her residence in [[Lavender Hill]].  One night, while waiting for the cinema doors to open, Viv, a woman from her past appears and hands to her a gold ring.  \n\n'''Helen'''\n\nHelen and her assistant Viv run a match-making agency near [[Bond Street]] for individuals who have either lost their loved one or were disappointed to see how much their sweethearts had changed after the war.  The work itself is not very fulfilling, but their hesitant friendship keeps them entertained.\n\n'''Viv'''\n\nAfter work, Viv sets off to meet her brother Duncan, who lives with a much older gentleman named Mr Mundy.  The three of them meet on a weekly basis for dinner at Mr Mundy's, and Viv always brings a tin of meat for them to share.   Duncan shrugs off news of their father, and proceeds to show Viv the latest addition to his antiques collection.  Viv politely ends the night and heads for the railway station, but she doesn't go home to her father's.  \n\nOn the same day that Helen wanted to confide her love for Julia to Viv, the two women receive an unexpected visit from Robert Fraser, Duncan\u2019s old cellmate.  He asks to speak with her regarding Duncan, and his present condition: collecting antiques (which Robert finds morbid), living with Mr Mundy, whom both men knew at the prison, and working at a candle factory.  Viv dismisses Fraser, feeling as though he thinks she and her father haven\u2019t done enough to help Duncan\u2019s situation and explains that he simply doesn\u2019t know everything.\n  \n'''Duncan'''\n\nDuncan accompanies Mr Mundy, or \"Uncle Horace,\" as he referred to him in public, every Tuesday to his [[Christian Science]] doctor at Lavender Hill.  After having dinner with his sister, Duncan works at the candle factory.  It is implied that the boss adores him, and he shies away when a younger co-worker brags about his latest indiscretion and invites Duncan to join him.   \nWhen he leaves work, Duncan is surprised to see Fraser waiting for him at the gates.  He invites Duncan to a pub by the water, and Duncan reluctantly agrees, mainly because he doesn't want Mr Mundy to worry.  \n\nFraser makes several calls at Duncan's for dinner.  One night, however, he doesn't show up, and Duncan is quite upset, while Mr Mundy is relieved.\n\n===1944===\n'''Duncan'''\n\nDuncan has been imprisoned in [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]] for three years now, and Viv and her father visit him once a month.  Duncan's time is juxtaposed between prison guard Mr Mundy's kind and defeatist demeanour and Fraser's free-thinking, free-acting attitude.\n  \n'''Viv '''\n\nViv is working as a typist, along with many other girls, and lodges at a boarding house with some of her co-workers.  She meets Reggie, who is married, at anonymous hotels once every five weeks, whenever Reggie is permitted leave from Wales.  \n\n'''Kay'''\n\nKay works as an emergency response ambulance worker along with Mickey.  She spends long nights cleaning up after air raids.\n\nOne night a call comes in to an air raid that has occurred on her street.  She assumes Helen's been asleep throughout the entire raid and panics.  She runs to the rubble to where her flat used to be and weeps at her loss.\n  \n'''Helen'''\n\nHelen works for the government in a division that assists those who've lost their belongings in the war.  By chance she runs into Julia, a woman who was once acquainted with Kay.  \nOne night Helen is unable to sleep and leaves for Julia's flat.  They take a walk around the ruins, and when another air raid alarm is sounded, they run amongst more ruins and hide from the chaos.\n\n===1941===\n\nViv is on a crowded train, filled with civilians and military men.  By chance, she meets a soldier named Reggie.  They engage in a conversation under awkward circumstances, and he reveals to her that he is stuck in an unhappy marriage.\n\n\nKay is responding to an emergency call along with Mickey.  They arrive at the scene and find one woman dead, another young woman caught underneath rubble, and two others trapped behind more debris.\n\n==Awards==\n* Man Booker Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006\n* Orange Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006\n* Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction, 2007\n\n==TV-movie adaptation==\nOn 25 November 2010, BBC2 network announced the cast for the 90-minute television adaptation of ''The Night Watch.''<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/11_november/25/night.shtml BBC press release]</ref> It was adapted by [[Paula Milne]] and directed by Richard Laxton and was broadcast on 12 July 2011 on BBC Two.\n\nCast:<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012mb0r Programme page on BBC Online]</ref>\n\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Kay\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Helen\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Viv\n* [[Harry Treadaway]] as Duncan\n* [[Anna Wilson-Jones]] as Julia\n* [[JJ Feild]] as Robert\n* [[Liam Garrigan]] as Reggie\n* [[Claudie Blakley]] as Nancy\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Mr Mundy\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sarahwaters.com/books/the-night-watch/ Book description at Sarah Waters' official webpage]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/08/fiction.sarahwaters Smoother than velvet:] Book review at The Guardian\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/books/review/26leavitt.html?ex=1175659200&en=724d48edfc187f77&ei=5070 This Is London:] Book review at the New York Times\n*[http://nishitak.com/2017/09/30/night-watch/ Great book on London during the Blitz] Book review at Nishita's Rants and Raves\n{{Sarah Waters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night Watch, The}}\n[[Category:Historical novels]]\n[[Category:World War II novels]]\n[[Category:2006 British novels]]\n[[Category:English novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Sarah Waters]]\n[[Category:Novels set in London]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1941]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:2000s LGBT novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2006 historical fiction novel}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = The Night Watch\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = TheNightWatchcover2006.jpg\n| caption       = UK first edition cover\n| author        = [[Sarah Waters]]\n| illustrator   =\n| cover_artist  = TWBG - Duncan Spilling<br>Lettering: Stephen Raw\n| country       = United Kingdom\n| language      = English\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Historical fiction]]\n| publisher     = Virago\n| release_date  = 2 Feb 2006 (UK)\n| english_release_date =\n| media_type    = Print (hardback & paperback)\n| pages         = 480 pp\n| isbn          = 1-84408-246-6\n| oclc= 62265716\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n'''''The Night Watch''''' is a dark, 2006 [[historical fiction]] novel by  [[Sarah Waters]].

It is implied that the boss adores him, and he shies away when a younger co-worker brags about his latest indiscretion and invites Duncan to join him.   \nWhen he leaves work, Duncan is surprised to see Fraser waiting for him at the gates.  He invites Duncan to a pub by the water, and Duncan reluctantly agrees, mainly because he doesn't want Mr Mundy to worry.  \n\nFraser makes several calls at Duncan's for dinner.  One night, however, he doesn't show up, and Duncan is quite upset, while Mr Mundy is relieved.\n\n===1944===\n'''Duncan'''\n\nDuncan has been imprisoned in [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]] for three years now, and Viv and her father visit him once a month.  Duncan's time is juxtaposed between prison guard Mr Mundy's kind and defeatist demeanour and Fraser's free-thinking, free-acting attitude.\n  \n'''Viv '''\n\nViv is working as a typist, along with many other girls, and lodges at a boarding house with some of her co-workers.  She meets Reggie, who is married, at anonymous hotels once every five weeks, whenever Reggie is permitted leave from Wales.  \n\n'''Kay'''\n\nKay works as an emergency response ambulance worker along with Mickey.  She spends long nights cleaning up after air raids.\n\nOne night a call comes in to an air raid that has occurred on her street.  She assumes Helen's been asleep throughout the entire raid and panics.  She runs to the rubble to where her flat used to be and weeps at her loss.\n  \n'''Helen'''\n\nHelen works for the government in a division that assists those who've lost their belongings in the war.  By chance she runs into Julia, a woman who was once acquainted with Kay.  \nOne night Helen is unable to sleep and leaves for Julia's flat.  They take a walk around the ruins, and when another air raid alarm is sounded, they run amongst more ruins and hide from the chaos.\n\n===1941===\n\nViv is on a crowded train, filled with civilians and military men.  By chance, she meets a soldier named Reggie.  They engage in a conversation under awkward circumstances, and he reveals to her that he is stuck in an unhappy marriage.\n\n\nKay is responding to an emergency call along with Mickey.  They arrive at the scene and find one woman dead, another young woman caught underneath rubble, and two others trapped behind more debris.\n\n==Awards==\n* Man Booker Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006\n* Orange Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006\n* Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction, 2007\n\n==TV-movie adaptation==\nOn 25 November 2010, BBC2 network announced the cast for the 90-minute television adaptation of ''The Night Watch.''<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/11_november/25/night.shtml BBC press release]</ref> It was adapted by [[Paula Milne]] and directed by Richard Laxton and was broadcast on 12 July 2011 on BBC Two.\n\nCast:<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012mb0r Programme page on BBC Online]</ref>\n\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Kay\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Helen\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Viv\n* [[Harry Treadaway]] as Duncan\n* [[Anna Wilson-Jones]] as Julia\n* [[JJ Feild]] as Robert\n* [[Liam Garrigan]] as Reggie\n* [[Claudie Blakley]] as Nancy\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Mr Mundy\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sarahwaters.com/books/the-night-watch/ Book description at Sarah Waters' official webpage]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/08/fiction.sarahwaters Smoother than velvet:] Book review at The Guardian\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/books/review/26leavitt.html?ex=1175659200&en=724d48edfc187f77&ei=5070 This Is London:] Book review at the New York Times\n*[http://nishitak.com/2017/09/30/night-watch/ Great book on London during the Blitz] Book review at Nishita's Rants and Raves\n{{Sarah Waters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night Watch, The}}\n[[Category:Historical novels]]\n[[Category:World War II novels]]\n[[Category:2006 British novels]]\n[[Category:English novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Sarah Waters]]\n[[Category:Novels set in London]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1941]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:2000s LGBT novels]]\n", "name_user": "Sfjohna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch_(Waters_novel)"}

It was released on 19 January 2018 by [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] and Liberator Music, as the lead single from her fourteenth studio album ''[[Golden (Kylie Minogue album)|Golden]]'' (2018). Written by Minogue, [[Steve McEwan]] and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], and produced by Sky Adams, \"Dancing\" was the singer's first material with BMG and Liberator, after finishing her contract with British label [[Parlophone]] two years prior. Musically, \"Dancing\" is a departure from her usual [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] sound, and adapts to [[country pop]] with elements of [[electronica]] and [[dance-pop]]. Lyrically, it talks about having fun and enjoying life, with [[death]] and [[time]] being incorporated into the song's themes.\n\n\"Dancing\" received critical acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]], many whom praised the song's production and lyrical quality. Upon its release on the parent album, certain critics had chosen it as a highlight. Commercially, the track reached the top twenty in regions such as Spain, Scotland, Hungary and Poland. It became the singer's 51st top-forty entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and her 14th number-one hit on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. Additionally, despite staying one week in the Top 50 in her native Australia,<ref name=\"Australia\" /> \"Dancing\" was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] for sales exceeding 35,000 units.\n\nDirected by [[Sophie Muller]], the music video features Minogue dancing and singing in several backdrops that were inspired by the [[Country music|Country and Western]] culture, such as the work of [[Dolly Parton]], and used motifs and imagery revolving around death. To promote the single, Minogue performed the song on her [[Kylie Presents Golden]] tour, and at several gigs and shows including ''[[Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'', ''[[Sport Relief]]'', the [[Echo Music Prize]] in Germany, and when she headlined [[Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park]].\n\n==Background and composition==\nIn 2016, Minogue released her final studio album with long-term record label [[Parlophone]], entitled ''[[Kylie Christmas: Snow Queen Edition]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Kylie Christmas: Snow Queen Edition|others=Minogue, Kylie|date=2016|type=CD Album|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|id=0190295890728|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> After her departure from the label, Minogue signed a new record deal with [[BMG Rights Management]] which will release her upcoming album internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/kylie-minogue-signs-new-record-deal-with-bmg-new-album-expected-this-year__18062/|title=Kylie Minogue signs new record deal with BMG, new album expected this year|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> In December 2017, Minogue and BMG had struck a joint-deal with [[Mushroom Group|Mushroom Music Labels]] \u2014 under the sub-division label Liberator Music to release her new album in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Mushroom Promotions 1\">{{cite news|title=Kylie Minogue {{!}} New Album Reunites Pop Princess With Mushroom Group In Australia {{!}} Mushroom Promotions|url=https://mushroompromotions.com/press-releases/kylie-minogue-new-album-reunites-pop-princess-mushroom-group-australia/|work=Mushroom Promotions|publisher=[[Mushroom Group]]|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=8 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208142226/https://mushroompromotions.com/press-releases/kylie-minogue-new-album-reunites-pop-princess-mushroom-group-australia/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref> Throughout that year, Minogue worked with writers and producers for her fourteenth studio album including [[Amy Wadge]], Sky Adams, [[DJ Fresh]], [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], and teamed with previous collaborators [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]], [[The Invisible Men]] and [[Karen Poole]].<ref name=\"lgbt\">{{cite web|author=Rudolph, Christopher|url=http://www.newnownext.com/kylie-minogue-new-album-lgbt-rights/06/2017/|title=Kylie Minogue's New Album Will Feature Songs About LGBT Rights|publisher=NewNowNext|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=White, Jack|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/kylie-minogue-has-hit-the-studio-with-dj-fresh-ahead-on-her-new-album__19869/|title=Kylie Minogue has hit the studio with DJ Fresh ahead on her new album|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=7 August 2017|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"heraldsun\">{{cite web|author=Adams, Cameron|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/melbourne/first-review-kylies-new-single-dancing-is-country-meets-club/news-story/6e284ab9ec7c514f7d6db53837b2b195|title=First review: Kylie's new single Dancing is country meets club|work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=18 January 2018|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref> \"Dancing\" was one of the tracks written and recorded in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where she felt the location had a \"profound\" effect on her.<ref name=\"lgbt\"/> It was co-written by Minogue alongside Wadge and Adams, whereas production was solely handled by the latter artist.

It was released on 19 January 2018 by [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] and Liberator Music, as the lead single from her fourteenth studio album ''[[Golden (Kylie Minogue album)|Golden]]'' (2018). Written by Minogue, [[Steve McEwan]] and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], and produced by Sky Adams, \"Dancing\" was the singer's first material with BMG and Liberator, after finishing her contract with British label [[Parlophone]] two years prior. Musically, \"Dancing\" is a departure from her usual [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] sound, and adapts to [[country pop]] with elements of [[electronica]] and [[dance-pop]]. Lyrically, it talks about having fun and enjoying life, with [[death]] and [[time]] being incorporated into the song's themes.\n\n\"Dancing\" received critical acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]], many whom praised the song's production and lyrical quality.

It became the singer's 51st top-forty entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and her 14th number-one hit on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. Additionally, despite staying one week in the Top 50 in her native Australia,<ref name=\"Australia\" /> \"Dancing\" was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] for sales exceeding 35,000 units.\n\nDirected by [[Sophie Muller]], the music video features Minogue dancing and singing in several backdrops that were inspired by the [[Country music|Country and Western]] culture, such as the work of [[Dolly Parton]], and used motifs and imagery revolving around death.

The Kingdom maintained independence from the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]], whose attempts to re-establish Roman authority in Hispania were only partially successful and short-lived.\n\nThe Visigoths were [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] central Europeans who had moved west from the Danube Valley.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kurlansky |first1=Mark |title=The Basque History Of The World |date=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9781448113224 |page=35}}</ref> They became [[Foederati]] of Rome, and wanted to restore the Roman order against the hordes of [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]].

The kingdom of the 6th and 7th centuries is sometimes called the ''regnum Toletanum'' after the new capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. A civil war starting in 549 resulted in an invitation from the Visigoth [[Athanagild]], who had usurped the kingship, to the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] to send soldiers to his assistance. Athanagild won his war, but the Byzantines took over [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and a good deal of southern Hispania and could not be dislodged. Starting in the 570s Athanagild's brother [[Liuvigild]] compensated for this loss by conquering the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] (roughly modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern part of [[Portugal]]) and annexing it, and by repeated campaigns against the [[Basques]].\n\nThe ethnic distinction between the  Hispano-Roman population and the Visigoths had largely disappeared by this time (the [[Gothic language]] lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref>Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800 (Transformation of the Roman World) by Walter Pohl, {{ISBN|90-04-10846-7}} (pp. 119\u2013121: dress and funerary customs cease to be distinguishing features in AD 570/580)</ref> This newfound unity found expression in increasingly severe persecution of outsiders, [[History of the Jews in Spain#Visigoth rule - Repression and forced conversions (5th century to 711)|especially the Jews]]. The [[Visigothic Code]] (completed in 654) abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans and for Visigoths. The 7th century saw many civil wars between factions of the aristocracy. Despite good records left by contemporary bishops, such as [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and [[Leander of Seville]], it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish Goths from Hispano-Romans, as the two became inextricably intertwined. Despite these civil wars, by 625&nbsp;AD the Visigoths had succeeded in expelling the Byzantines from Hispania and had established a foothold at the port of [[Ceuta]] in Africa. Most of the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad troops]] from [[Maghreb|North Africa]] in 711&nbsp;AD, with only the northern reaches of Hispania remaining in Christian hands. These gave birth to the medieval [[Kingdom of Asturias]] when a local landlord called [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]], most likely of Gothic origin, was elected [[Princeps]] by the [[Astures]].\n\nThe Visigoths and their early kings were [[Arianism|Arians]] and came into conflict with the Catholic Church, but after they converted to [[Nicene Christianity]], the Church exerted an enormous influence on secular affairs through the [[Councils of Toledo]]. The Visigoths also developed the highly influential law code known in Western Europe as the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (''Liber Iudiciorum''), which would become the basis for Spanish law throughout the Middle Ages.\n\n==History==\n\n===Federate Kingdom===\n[[File:Hispania 418 AD.PNG|thumb|Visigothic settlement and the Iberian peninsula, ''circa'' 418]]\n[[File:Sueben.jpg|thumb|Gold coin (411\u2013450&nbsp;AD) from the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] in the Iberian peninsula]]\n\nFrom 407 to 409&nbsp;AD, an alliance of Germanic [[Vandals]], Iranian [[Alans]] and Germanic [[Suebi]] [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed]] the frozen Rhine and swept across modern France and into the Iberian peninsula. For their part, the Visigoths under [[Alaric I|Alaric]] famously [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]], capturing [[Galla Placidia]], the sister of Western Roman emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].\n\n[[Ataulf]] (King of the Visigoths from 410 to 415) spent the next few years operating in the Gallic and Hispanic countrysides, diplomatically playing competing factions of Germanic and Roman commanders against one another to skillful effect, and taking over cities such as [[Narbonne]] and [[Toulouse]] (in 413). After he married Placidia, the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] enlisted him to provide Visigothic assistance in regaining nominal Roman control of Hispania from the Vandals, Alans and Suebi.\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] under King [[Wallia]] (reigned 415\u2013419) by giving them land in the [[Garonne]] valley of [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle. This probably took place under the system of ''hospitalitas''. It seems likely that at first the Visigoths were not given a large amount of land estates in the region (as previously believed), but that they acquired the taxes of the region, with the local Gallic aristocrats now paying their taxes to the Visigoths instead of to the Roman government.<ref name=\"Cambridge Ancient v. 14\">{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Ward |author2=Perkins and Whitby  |title=The Cambridge Ancient HIstory - Volume XIV.

Under [[Theodoric I]] (418\u2013451), the Visigoths attacked [[Arles]] (in [[Battle of Arles (435)|425]]{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=365}} and 430{{sfn|Barrett|2018|p=1475}}) and [[Narbonne]] ([[Battle of Narbonne (436)|436]]),{{sfn|Barrett|2018|p=1475}} but were checked by [[Flavius Aetius]] using [[Huns|Hunnic mercenaries]], and Theodoric was defeated in 438.

The Goths sacked the cities in Gallaecia, part of the Suebi Kingdom quite brutally: they massacred a portion of the population and even attacked some holy places, probably due to the clergy's support of the Suebi.<ref name=\"NC Medieval v.

In 461, the Goths received the city of Narbonne from the emperor [[Libius Severus]] in exchange for their support. This led to a revolt by the army and by Gallo-Romans under Aegidius; as a result, Romans under Severus and the Visigoths fought other Roman troops, and the revolt ended only in 465.<ref>Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 24.</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Toulouse===\n[[File:Theodoric I by Fabrizio Castello 1560 1617.jpg|thumb|[[Theodoric I]] by [[Fabrizio Castello]] (1560\u20131617)]]\n[[File:Hispania 476 AD.PNG|thumb|The Iberian peninsula around 476]]\n\nIn 466, [[Euric]], who was the youngest son of [[Theodoric I]], came to the Visigothic throne. He is infamous for murdering his elder brother [[Theodoric II]] who had himself become king by murdering his elder brother [[Thorismund]].  Under Euric (466\u2013484), the Visigoths began expanding in Gaul and consolidating their presence in the Iberian peninsula. Euric fought a series of wars with the [[Suebi]] who retained some influence in Lusitania, and brought most of this region under Visigothic power, taking Emerita Augusta ([[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]]) in 469. Euric also attacked the Western Roman Empire, capturing [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] in 472, the last bastion of Roman rule in Spain. By 476, he had extended his rule to the [[Rhone]] and the [[Loire]] rivers which comprised most of southern Gaul. He also occupied the key Roman cities of [[Arles]] and [[Marseilles]]. In his campaigns, Euric had counted on a portion of the Gallo-Roman and Hispano-Roman aristocracy who served under him as generals and governors. The Visigothic Kingdom was formally recognized when the Western emperor [[Julius Nepos]] (473\u2013480) signed an alliance with Euric, granting him the lands south of the Loire and west of the Rhone in exchange for military service and the lands in [[Provence]] (including Arles and Marseilles). The lands in Hispania remained under ''de facto'' Visigothic control. After [[Odoacer]] deposed the last Roman emperor in the West, [[Romulus Augustulus]], Euric quickly recaptured [[Provence]], a fact which Odoacer formally accepted in a treaty.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 167\u2013171.</ref>\n\nBy 500, the Visigothic Kingdom, centered at [[Toulouse]], controlled [[Gallia Aquitania]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and most of Hispania with the exception of the [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia]] in the northwest and small areas controlled by independent Iberian peoples, such as the [[Basques]] and the [[Cantabri]]ans. Euric's son [[Alaric II]] (484\u2013507) issued a new body of laws, the ''Breviarium Alarici'' and held a church council at [[Agde]].\n\n[[File:Battle between Clovis and the Visigoths.jpg|thumb|Clovis I fights the Visigoths]]\n\nThe Visigoths now came into conflict with the Franks under their King [[Clovis I]], who had conquered northern Gaul. Following a brief war with the Franks, Alaric was forced to put down a rebellion in Tarraconensis, probably caused by recent Visigoth immigration to Hispania due to pressure from the Franks. In 507, the Franks attacked again, this time allied with the [[Burgundians]]. Alaric II was killed at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9|Battle of Campus Vogladensis]] ([[Vouill\u00e9, Vienne|Vouill\u00e9]]) near [[Poitiers]], and Toulouse was sacked. By 508, the Visigoths had lost most of their Gallic holdings save [[Septimania]] in the south.<ref>Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\n===Arian Kingdom of Hispania===\n[[File:Spanish Visigothic gold tremisses in the name of emperor Justinian I with cross on breast 7th century.jpg|thumb|Visigothic pseudo-imperial gold [[tremissis]] in the name of emperor [[Justinian I]], 6th century: the [[Christian cross]] on the breast defines the Visigothic attribution.

Gesalic fled and regrouped, but was defeated again at [[Barcelona]], and was captured and killed. Theodoric then installed his grandson [[Amalaric]] (511\u2013531), the son of Alaric II, as king. Amalaric, however, was still a child and power in Spain remained under the Ostrogothic general and regent, [[Theudis]]. Only after Theodoric's death (526) did Amalaric obtain control of his kingdom. His rule did not last long, as in 531, Amalaric was defeated by the Frankish king [[Childebert I]] and then murdered at Barcelona. Afterwards, [[Theudis]] (531\u2013548) became king. He expanded Visigothic control over the southern regions, but he was also murdered after a failed invasion of Africa. Visigothic Spain suffered a civil war under King [[Agila I]] (549\u2013554), which prompted the Roman/Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] to send an army and carve out the small province of [[Spania]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]] along the coast of southern Spain. Agila was eventually killed, and his enemy [[Athanagild]] (552\u2013568) became the new king. He attacked the Byzantines, but he was unable to dislodge them from southern Spain, and was obliged to formally acknowledge the [[suzerainty]] of the Empire.\n\n[[File:Hispania 586 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing the conquests of Leovigild, ''circa'' 586]]\n\nThe next Visigothic king was [[Liuvigild]] (569&nbsp;\u2013 April 21, 586). He was an effective military leader and consolidated Visigothic power in Spain. Liuvigild campaigned against the Romans in the south in the 570s and he took back [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]] after another revolt. He also fought in the north against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Galician Kingdom of the Suebi]] and various small independent states, including the Basques and the Cantabrians. He pacified northern Spain, but was unable to completely conquer these peoples. When Liuvigild established his son [[Hermenegild]] as joint ruler, a civil war ensued between them. Hermenegild became the first Visigothic king to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] due to his ties with the Romans, but he was defeated in 584 and killed in 585.<ref>[[Charles William Previt\u00e9-Orton]], ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'', (Cambridge University Press, 1979), 145.</ref> By the end of his reign, Liuvigild had united the entire Iberian peninsula, including the Suebic Kingdom which he conquered in 585 during a [[Suebi]] civil war that ensued after the death of King [[Miro (Suevic king)|Miro]]. Liuvigild established amicable terms with the Franks through royal marriages, and they remained at peace throughout most of his reign. Liuvigild also founded new cities, such as [[Reccopolis]] and Victoriacum ([[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]]), the first barbarian king to do so.<ref>NC Medieval v.

This led to some unrest in the kingdom, notably a revolt by the Arian  bishop of M\u00e9rida which was put down; he also beat back another Frankish offensive in the north. Reccared then oversaw the [[Third Council of Toledo]] in 589, where he announced his faith in the Nicene creed and denounced Arian. He adopted the name Flavius, the family name of the Constantinian dynasty, and styled himself as the successor to the Roman emperors. Reccared also fought the Byzantines in [[Hispania Baetica]] after they had begun a new offensive.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 346\u2013350.</ref>\n\nReccared's son Liuva II became king in 601, but was deposed by the Visigothic noble [[Witteric]] (603\u2013610), ending the short-lived dynasty. There were various Visigothic Kings between 610 and 631, and this period saw constant regicide. This period also saw the definitive conquest of the Byzantine territories in the south. War continued in the north against the Basques and [[Asturias|Asturians]], as indeed it would continue for the rest of the Visigothic Kingdom's existence. These Kings also worked on religious legislature, especially King [[Sisebut]] (612\u2013621), who passed several harsh laws against Jews and forced many Jews to convert to Christianity. Sisebut was also successful against the Byzantines, taking several of their cities, including [[M\u00e1laga]]. The Byzantines were finally defeated by [[Suintila]] (621\u2013631), who had captured all of their Spanish holdings by 625. Suinthila was deposed by the Franks and replaced by [[Sisinand]].<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 350\u2013353.</ref>\n\nThe instability of this period can be attributed to the power struggle between the kings and the nobility. Religious unification strengthened the political power of the church, which it exercised through church councils at Toledo along with the nobles. The fourth council, held during the brief reign of [[Sisinand]] in 633, excommunicated and exiled the king, replacing him with [[Chintila]] (636\u2013639). The church councils were now the most powerful institution in the Visigothic state; they took the role of regulating the process of succession to the kingship by election of the king by Gothic noble 'senators' and the church officials. They also decided to meet on a regular basis to discuss ecclesiastical and political matters affecting the Church. Finally, they decided the kings should die in peace, and declared their persons sacred, seeking to end the violence and regicides of the past. Despite all this, another coup took place and Chintila was deposed in 639, and King Tulga took his place; he was also deposed in the third year of his reign and the council elected the noble [[Chindasuinth]] as king.\n\n[[File:Chindasuinth.jpg|thumb|right|King Chindasuinth from the [[Codex Vigilanus|C\u00f3dex Albedense.]]]]\n\nThe reigns of [[Chindasuinth]] and his son [[Recceswinth]] saw the compilation of the most important Visigothic law book, the ''[[Liber Iudiciorum]]'' (completed in 654). The code included old laws by past kings, such as  Alaric II in his ''Breviarium Alarici'', and Leovigild, but many were also new laws. The code was based almost wholly on Roman law, with some influence of Germanic law in rare cases. The new laws applied to both Gothic and Hispano-Roman populations who had been under different laws in the past, and it replaced all older codes of law. Among the eliminated old laws were the harsh laws against Jews. The ''Liber'' showed the old system of military and civil divisions in administration was changing, and dukes (''duces provinciae'') and counts (''comites civitatis'') had begun taking more responsibilities outside their original military and civil duties. The servants or slaves of the king became very prominent in the bureaucracy and exercised wide administrative powers. With the Visigoth law codes, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20. Chindasuinth (642\u2013653) strengthened the monarchy at the expense of the nobility, he executed some 700 nobles, forced dignitaries to swear oaths, and in the seventh council of Toledo laid down his right to excommunicate clergy who acted against the government. He was also able to maneuver his son [[Recceswinth]] on the throne, sparking a rebellion by a gothic noble who allied with the Basques, but was put down. Reccesuinth (653\u2013672) held another council of Toledo, which reduced sentences for treason and affirmed the power of the councils to elect kings.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 356\u2013360.</ref>\n\nFollowing Reccesuinth, King [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] (672\u2013680) was elected king. He had to deal with initial revolts in Tarraconensis, and because of this, he felt a need to reform the army. He passed a law declaring all dukes, counts and other military leaders, as well as bishops, had to come to the aid of the kingdom once danger became known or risk harsh punishment. Wamba was eventually deposed in a bloodless coup. King Ervig (680\u2013687) held further church councils and repealed the previous harsh laws of Wamba, though he still made provisions for the army. Ervig had his son-in-law Egica made king. Despite a rebellion by the bishop of Toledo, the 16th council, held in 693, denounced the bishop's revolt. The 17th council in 694 passed harsh laws against the Jews, citing a conspiracy, and many were enslaved, especially those who had converted from Christianity. Egica also raised his son [[Wittiza]] as coruler in 698. Not much is known about his reign, but a period of civil war quickly ensued between his sons (Achila  and Ardo) and King Roderic, who had seized Toledo.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 360\u2013369.</ref>\n\n===Muslim conquest===\n{{main|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|}}\n[[File:King Roderich, Qusayr Amra.jpg|thumb|90px|Copy of a mural from [[Qusayr Amra]], depicting king Roderic]]\nIn 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Muslim [[Berber people|Berber]] client of [[Musa bin Nusair]], the governor of Islamic Africa, invaded Spain with about 7,000 Berber men, while [[Roderic]] was in the north fighting the [[Basques]]. The tale that [[Julian, Count of Ceuta]], facilitated the invasion, because one of his daughters had been dishonored by Roderic, is possibly mythical. By late July, a battle took place at the [[Guadalete River]] in the province of [[C\u00e1diz]]. Roderic was betrayed by his troops, who sided with his enemies, and the king was killed in battle. The Muslims then took much of southern Spain with little resistance, and went on to capture Toledo, where they executed several Visigothic nobles. In 712, Musa, the governor of [[Ifriqiya]], arrived with another army of 18,000, with large Arab contingents. He took [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] in 713 and invaded the north, taking [[Saragossa]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], which were still under King Ardo, in 714. After being recalled by the [[Caliph]], Musa left his son Abd al-\u2018Aziz in command. By 716, most of the Iberian Peninsula was under Islamic rule, with [[Septimania]] taken between 721 and 725. The only effective resistance was in Asturias, where a local or Visigothic nobleman named Pelagius ([[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]]) revolted in 718, and defeated the Muslims at the [[battle of Covadonga]]; this was the beginning of the Reconquest. Pelayo collaborated the [[Astures]], while some Visigoth Nobles and some Visigoth population went to the North of Hispania and took refuge in Asturias, fleeing the Muslim conquest, and joined Pelayo. Resistance also continued in the regions around the [[Pyrenees]] with the establishment of the [[Marca Hispanica]] from 760 to 785. The [[Berber people|Berbers]] settled in the south and the [[Meseta Central]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. Initially, the Muslims generally left the Christians alone to practise their religion, although non-Muslims were subject to Islamic law and treated as second-class citizens.<ref>NC Medieval v.

Their settlements were made around the Roman cities of ''Emerita Augusta'' (M\u00e9rida), ''Barcino'' (Barcelona), ''Hispalis'' (Seville), ''Toletum)'' (Toledo) and [[Septimania]]n Narbonne, which would be the main bases of Gothic power politically as well as militarily during the rest of the kingdom's history, as well as other settlements which were dispersed in rural farming areas between the upper reaches of the [[Douro]], [[Ebro]] and [[Tagus]] rivers, in an area between [[Tierra de Campos]], also known as ''Campi Gothorum'', around Central [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], and Toledo to the east and south. After the fall of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Galician Kingdom of the Suebi]], some further settlements were made along the [[Tagus]] river north of [[Lisbon]], by [[Oporto]] and [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] former strongholds of the [[Suebi]]. Little Visigothic settlement occurred elsewhere in the kingdom.<ref>World and Its Peoples: Europe, Marshall Cavendish 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-7614-7883-6}}, p. 60</ref>\n\n==Founding of cities==\n[[File:Wisig Quintanilla de las Vignas b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hermitage of Santa Mar\u00eda de Lara|Church of Santa Maria de Lara]], most likely built just before the Muslim invasion]]\nThe Visigoths founded the only new cities in Western Europe between the fifth and eighth centuries. It is certain (through contemporary Spanish accounts) that they founded four, and a possible fifth city is ascribed to them by a later Arabic source. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory.\n\nThe first, [[Reccopolis]], was founded by Liuvigild in 578 after his victory over the Franks, near what is today the tiny village of [[Zorita de los Canes]]. He named it after his son Reccared and built it with Byzantine imitations, containing a palace complex and mint, but it lay in ruins by the 9th century (after the [[Arab]] conquest).\n\nAt a slightly later date, Liuvigild founded a city he named ''Victoriacum'' after his victory over the Basques.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, \"The Barbarian Kingdoms in Gaul and Spain\".</ref> Though it is often supposed to survive as the city of [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]], contemporary 12th-century sources refer to the latter city's foundation by [[Sancho VI of Navarre]].\n\nLiuvigild's son and namesake of the first Visigothic city founded his own sometime around 600. It is referred to by [[Isidore of Seville]] as ''Lugo id est Luceo'' in the [[Asturias]], built after a victory over the Asturians or [[Cantabri]].<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nThe fourth and possibly final city of the Goths was ''Ologicus'' (perhaps ''Ologitis''), founded using Basque labour in 621 by [[Suintila]] as a fortification against the recently subjected Basques. It is to be identified with modern [[Olite]].<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nThe possible fifth Visigothic foundation is ''Baiyara'' (perhaps modern [[Montoro]]), mentioned as founded by Reccared in the ''Geography'' of [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar]].<ref>Lacarra, \"Panorama de la historia urbana en la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica desde el siglo V al X,\" ''La citt\u00e0 nell'alto medioevo'', '''6''' (1958:319&ndash;358), in ''Estudios de alta edad media espa\u00f1ola'', p. 48.</ref>\n\n==Culture and classical heritage==\n[[File:Couronne Wisigoth.jpg|110px|thumb|Elaborate [[votive crown]] of king [[Recceswinth]], part of the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]]. Spain]]\nThe Visigothic rule has often been attributed to be a part of the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], a time of cultural and scientific decay reversed only by Muslim [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]. Through the course of their existence the Visigoths supposedly remained \"men of the woods never strayed too far from there,\" as [[Thomas F.

They were the most common helmet type of the early Middle Ages and remained in use even after the fall of the Visigothic kingdom.

One of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] successor states to the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was originally created by the settlement of the [[Visigoths]] under King [[Wallia]] in the province of [[Gallia Aquitania]] in southwest [[Gaul]] by the Roman government and then extended by conquest over all of [[Hispania]]. The Kingdom maintained independence from the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]], whose attempts to re-establish Roman authority in Hispania were only partially successful and short-lived.\n\nThe Visigoths were [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] central Europeans who had moved west from the Danube Valley.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kurlansky |first1=Mark |title=The Basque History Of The World |date=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9781448113224 |page=35}}</ref> They became [[Foederati]] of Rome, and wanted to restore the Roman order against the hordes of [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]]. The [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire fell]] in 476&nbsp;AD; therefore, the Visigoths believed they had the right to take the territories that Rome had promised in Hispania in exchange for restoring the Roman order.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Orlandis|first1=Jos\u00e9|title=Historia del reino visigodo espa\u00f1ol : los acontecimientos, las instituciones, la sociedad, los protagonistas|date=2003|publisher=Rialp|location=Madrid|isbn=8432134694|edition= 2nd}}</ref> Under King [[Euric]]\u2014who eliminated the status of Foederati\u2014a triumphal advance of the Visigoths began.

The Roman army was [[Battle of Arles (471)|crushed in battle nearby]] and Euric then captured Arles and secured much of southern Gaul.\n\nSometimes referred to as the ''regnum Tolosanum'' or '''Kingdom of Toulouse''' after its capital [[Toulouse]] in modern historiography, the kingdom [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|lost much of its territory in Gaul]] to the [[Franks]] in the early 6th century, save the narrow coastal strip of [[Septimania]]. The kingdom of the 6th and 7th centuries is sometimes called the ''regnum Toletanum'' after the new capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. A civil war starting in 549 resulted in an invitation from the Visigoth [[Athanagild]], who had usurped the kingship, to the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] to send soldiers to his assistance. Athanagild won his war, but the Byzantines took over [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and a good deal of southern Hispania and could not be dislodged. Starting in the 570s Athanagild's brother [[Liuvigild]] compensated for this loss by conquering the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] (roughly modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern part of [[Portugal]]) and annexing it, and by repeated campaigns against the [[Basques]].\n\nThe ethnic distinction between the  Hispano-Roman population and the Visigoths had largely disappeared by this time (the [[Gothic language]] lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref>Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800 (Transformation of the Roman World) by Walter Pohl, {{ISBN|90-04-10846-7}} (pp. 119\u2013121: dress and funerary customs cease to be distinguishing features in AD 570/580)</ref> This newfound unity found expression in increasingly severe persecution of outsiders, [[History of the Jews in Spain#Visigoth rule - Repression and forced conversions (5th century to 711)|especially the Jews]]. The [[Visigothic Code]] (completed in 654) abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans and for Visigoths. The 7th century saw many civil wars between factions of the aristocracy. Despite good records left by contemporary bishops, such as [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and [[Leander of Seville]], it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish Goths from Hispano-Romans, as the two became inextricably intertwined. Despite these civil wars, by 625&nbsp;AD the Visigoths had succeeded in expelling the Byzantines from Hispania and had established a foothold at the port of [[Ceuta]] in Africa. Most of the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad troops]] from [[Maghreb|North Africa]] in 711&nbsp;AD, with only the northern reaches of Hispania remaining in Christian hands. These gave birth to the medieval [[Kingdom of Asturias]] when a local landlord called [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]], most likely of Gothic origin, was elected [[Princeps]] by the [[Astures]].\n\nThe Visigoths and their early kings were [[Arianism|Arians]] and came into conflict with the Catholic Church, but after they converted to [[Nicene Christianity]], the Church exerted an enormous influence on secular affairs through the [[Councils of Toledo]]. The Visigoths also developed the highly influential law code known in Western Europe as the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (''Liber Iudiciorum''), which would become the basis for Spanish law throughout the Middle Ages.\n\n==History==\n\n===Federate Kingdom===\n[[File:Hispania 418 AD.PNG|thumb|Visigothic settlement and the Iberian peninsula, ''circa'' 418]]\n[[File:Sueben.jpg|thumb|Gold coin (411\u2013450&nbsp;AD) from the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] in the Iberian peninsula]]\n\nFrom 407 to 409&nbsp;AD, an alliance of Germanic [[Vandals]], Iranian [[Alans]] and Germanic [[Suebi]] [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed]] the frozen Rhine and swept across modern France and into the Iberian peninsula.

After he married Placidia, the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] enlisted him to provide Visigothic assistance in regaining nominal Roman control of Hispania from the Vandals, Alans and Suebi.\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] under King [[Wallia]] (reigned 415\u2013419) by giving them land in the [[Garonne]] valley of [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle. This probably took place under the system of ''hospitalitas''. It seems likely that at first the Visigoths were not given a large amount of land estates in the region (as previously believed), but that they acquired the taxes of the region, with the local Gallic aristocrats now paying their taxes to the Visigoths instead of to the Roman government.<ref name=\"Cambridge Ancient v. 14\">{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Ward |author2=Perkins and Whitby  |title=The Cambridge Ancient HIstory - Volume XIV.

He is infamous for murdering his elder brother [[Theodoric II]] who had himself become king by murdering his elder brother [[Thorismund]].  Under Euric (466\u2013484), the Visigoths began expanding in Gaul and consolidating their presence in the Iberian peninsula. Euric fought a series of wars with the [[Suebi]] who retained some influence in Lusitania, and brought most of this region under Visigothic power, taking Emerita Augusta ([[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]]) in 469. Euric also attacked the Western Roman Empire, capturing [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] in 472, the last bastion of Roman rule in Spain. By 476, he had extended his rule to the [[Rhone]] and the [[Loire]] rivers which comprised most of southern Gaul. He also occupied the key Roman cities of [[Arles]] and [[Marseilles]]. In his campaigns, Euric had counted on a portion of the Gallo-Roman and Hispano-Roman aristocracy who served under him as generals and governors. The Visigothic Kingdom was formally recognized when the Western emperor [[Julius Nepos]] (473\u2013480) signed an alliance with Euric, granting him the lands south of the Loire and west of the Rhone in exchange for military service and the lands in [[Provence]] (including Arles and Marseilles). The lands in Hispania remained under ''de facto'' Visigothic control. After [[Odoacer]] deposed the last Roman emperor in the West, [[Romulus Augustulus]], Euric quickly recaptured [[Provence]], a fact which Odoacer formally accepted in a treaty.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 167\u2013171.</ref>\n\nBy 500, the Visigothic Kingdom, centered at [[Toulouse]], controlled [[Gallia Aquitania]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and most of Hispania with the exception of the [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia]] in the northwest and small areas controlled by independent Iberian peoples, such as the [[Basques]] and the [[Cantabri]]ans. Euric's son [[Alaric II]] (484\u2013507) issued a new body of laws, the ''Breviarium Alarici'' and held a church council at [[Agde]].\n\n[[File:Battle between Clovis and the Visigoths.jpg|thumb|Clovis I fights the Visigoths]]\n\nThe Visigoths now came into conflict with the Franks under their King [[Clovis I]], who had conquered northern Gaul. Following a brief war with the Franks, Alaric was forced to put down a rebellion in Tarraconensis, probably caused by recent Visigoth immigration to Hispania due to pressure from the Franks. In 507, the Franks attacked again, this time allied with the [[Burgundians]]. Alaric II was killed at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9|Battle of Campus Vogladensis]] ([[Vouill\u00e9, Vienne|Vouill\u00e9]]) near [[Poitiers]], and Toulouse was sacked.

Gesalic fled and regrouped, but was defeated again at [[Barcelona]], and was captured and killed. Theodoric then installed his grandson [[Amalaric]] (511\u2013531), the son of Alaric II, as king. Amalaric, however, was still a child and power in Spain remained under the Ostrogothic general and regent, [[Theudis]]. Only after Theodoric's death (526) did Amalaric obtain control of his kingdom. His rule did not last long, as in 531, Amalaric was defeated by the Frankish king [[Childebert I]] and then murdered at Barcelona. Afterwards, [[Theudis]] (531\u2013548) became king. He expanded Visigothic control over the southern regions, but he was also murdered after a failed invasion of Africa. Visigothic Spain suffered a civil war under King [[Agila I]] (549\u2013554), which prompted the Roman/Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] to send an army and carve out the small province of [[Spania]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]] along the coast of southern Spain. Agila was eventually killed, and his enemy [[Athanagild]] (552\u2013568) became the new king. He attacked the Byzantines, but he was unable to dislodge them from southern Spain, and was obliged to formally acknowledge the [[suzerainty]] of the Empire.\n\n[[File:Hispania 586 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing the conquests of Leovigild, ''circa'' 586]]\n\nThe next Visigothic king was [[Liuvigild]] (569&nbsp;\u2013 April 21, 586). He was an effective military leader and consolidated Visigothic power in Spain. Liuvigild campaigned against the Romans in the south in the 570s and he took back [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]] after another revolt. He also fought in the north against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Galician Kingdom of the Suebi]] and various small independent states, including the Basques and the Cantabrians. He pacified northern Spain, but was unable to completely conquer these peoples. When Liuvigild established his son [[Hermenegild]] as joint ruler, a civil war ensued between them. Hermenegild became the first Visigothic king to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] due to his ties with the Romans, but he was defeated in 584 and killed in 585.<ref>[[Charles William Previt\u00e9-Orton]], ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'', (Cambridge University Press, 1979), 145.</ref> By the end of his reign, Liuvigild had united the entire Iberian peninsula, including the Suebic Kingdom which he conquered in 585 during a [[Suebi]] civil war that ensued after the death of King [[Miro (Suevic king)|Miro]]. Liuvigild established amicable terms with the Franks through royal marriages, and they remained at peace throughout most of his reign. Liuvigild also founded new cities, such as [[Reccopolis]] and Victoriacum ([[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]]), the first barbarian king to do so.<ref>NC Medieval v.

This led to some unrest in the kingdom, notably a revolt by the Arian  bishop of M\u00e9rida which was put down; he also beat back another Frankish offensive in the north. Reccared then oversaw the [[Third Council of Toledo]] in 589, where he announced his faith in the Nicene creed and denounced Arian. He adopted the name Flavius, the family name of the Constantinian dynasty, and styled himself as the successor to the Roman emperors. Reccared also fought the Byzantines in [[Hispania Baetica]] after they had begun a new offensive.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 346\u2013350.</ref>\n\nReccared's son Liuva II became king in 601, but was deposed by the Visigothic noble [[Witteric]] (603\u2013610), ending the short-lived dynasty. There were various Visigothic Kings between 610 and 631, and this period saw constant regicide. This period also saw the definitive conquest of the Byzantine territories in the south. War continued in the north against the Basques and [[Asturias|Asturians]], as indeed it would continue for the rest of the Visigothic Kingdom's existence. These Kings also worked on religious legislature, especially King [[Sisebut]] (612\u2013621), who passed several harsh laws against Jews and forced many Jews to convert to Christianity. Sisebut was also successful against the Byzantines, taking several of their cities, including [[M\u00e1laga]]. The Byzantines were finally defeated by [[Suintila]] (621\u2013631), who had captured all of their Spanish holdings by 625. Suinthila was deposed by the Franks and replaced by [[Sisinand]].<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 350\u2013353.</ref>\n\nThe instability of this period can be attributed to the power struggle between the kings and the nobility. Religious unification strengthened the political power of the church, which it exercised through church councils at Toledo along with the nobles. The fourth council, held during the brief reign of [[Sisinand]] in 633, excommunicated and exiled the king, replacing him with [[Chintila]] (636\u2013639). The church councils were now the most powerful institution in the Visigothic state; they took the role of regulating the process of succession to the kingship by election of the king by Gothic noble 'senators' and the church officials. They also decided to meet on a regular basis to discuss ecclesiastical and political matters affecting the Church. Finally, they decided the kings should die in peace, and declared their persons sacred, seeking to end the violence and regicides of the past. Despite all this, another coup took place and Chintila was deposed in 639, and King Tulga took his place; he was also deposed in the third year of his reign and the council elected the noble [[Chindasuinth]] as king.\n\n[[File:Chindasuinth.jpg|thumb|right|King Chindasuinth from the [[Codex Vigilanus|C\u00f3dex Albedense.]]]]\n\nThe reigns of [[Chindasuinth]] and his son [[Recceswinth]] saw the compilation of the most important Visigothic law book, the ''[[Liber Iudiciorum]]'' (completed in 654). The code included old laws by past kings, such as  Alaric II in his ''Breviarium Alarici'', and Leovigild, but many were also new laws. The code was based almost wholly on Roman law, with some influence of Germanic law in rare cases. The new laws applied to both Gothic and Hispano-Roman populations who had been under different laws in the past, and it replaced all older codes of law. Among the eliminated old laws were the harsh laws against Jews. The ''Liber'' showed the old system of military and civil divisions in administration was changing, and dukes (''duces provinciae'') and counts (''comites civitatis'') had begun taking more responsibilities outside their original military and civil duties. The servants or slaves of the king became very prominent in the bureaucracy and exercised wide administrative powers. With the Visigoth law codes, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20. Chindasuinth (642\u2013653) strengthened the monarchy at the expense of the nobility, he executed some 700 nobles, forced dignitaries to swear oaths, and in the seventh council of Toledo laid down his right to excommunicate clergy who acted against the government. He was also able to maneuver his son [[Recceswinth]] on the throne, sparking a rebellion by a gothic noble who allied with the Basques, but was put down. Reccesuinth (653\u2013672) held another council of Toledo, which reduced sentences for treason and affirmed the power of the councils to elect kings.<ref>NC Medieval v. I, p. 356\u2013360.</ref>\n\nFollowing Reccesuinth, King [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] (672\u2013680) was elected king. He had to deal with initial revolts in Tarraconensis, and because of this, he felt a need to reform the army. He passed a law declaring all dukes, counts and other military leaders, as well as bishops, had to come to the aid of the kingdom once danger became known or risk harsh punishment. Wamba was eventually deposed in a bloodless coup. King Ervig (680\u2013687) held further church councils and repealed the previous harsh laws of Wamba, though he still made provisions for the army. Ervig had his son-in-law Egica made king. Despite a rebellion by the bishop of Toledo, the 16th council, held in 693, denounced the bishop's revolt. The 17th council in 694 passed harsh laws against the Jews, citing a conspiracy, and many were enslaved, especially those who had converted from Christianity. Egica also raised his son [[Wittiza]] as coruler in 698. Not much is known about his reign, but a period of civil war quickly ensued between his sons (Achila  and Ardo) and King Roderic, who had seized Toledo.<ref>NC Medieval v.

The tale that [[Julian, Count of Ceuta]], facilitated the invasion, because one of his daughters had been dishonored by Roderic, is possibly mythical. By late July, a battle took place at the [[Guadalete River]] in the province of [[C\u00e1diz]]. Roderic was betrayed by his troops, who sided with his enemies, and the king was killed in battle. The Muslims then took much of southern Spain with little resistance, and went on to capture Toledo, where they executed several Visigothic nobles. In 712, Musa, the governor of [[Ifriqiya]], arrived with another army of 18,000, with large Arab contingents. He took [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] in 713 and invaded the north, taking [[Saragossa]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], which were still under King Ardo, in 714. After being recalled by the [[Caliph]], Musa left his son Abd al-\u2018Aziz in command. By 716, most of the Iberian Peninsula was under Islamic rule, with [[Septimania]] taken between 721 and 725. The only effective resistance was in Asturias, where a local or Visigothic nobleman named Pelagius ([[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]]) revolted in 718, and defeated the Muslims at the [[battle of Covadonga]]; this was the beginning of the Reconquest. Pelayo collaborated the [[Astures]], while some Visigoth Nobles and some Visigoth population went to the North of Hispania and took refuge in Asturias, fleeing the Muslim conquest, and joined Pelayo. Resistance also continued in the regions around the [[Pyrenees]] with the establishment of the [[Marca Hispanica]] from 760 to 785. The [[Berber people|Berbers]] settled in the south and the [[Meseta Central]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. Initially, the Muslims generally left the Christians alone to practise their religion, although non-Muslims were subject to Islamic law and treated as second-class citizens.<ref>NC Medieval v.

Their settlements were made around the Roman cities of ''Emerita Augusta'' (M\u00e9rida), ''Barcino'' (Barcelona), ''Hispalis'' (Seville), ''Toletum)'' (Toledo) and [[Septimania]]n Narbonne, which would be the main bases of Gothic power politically as well as militarily during the rest of the kingdom's history, as well as other settlements which were dispersed in rural farming areas between the upper reaches of the [[Douro]], [[Ebro]] and [[Tagus]] rivers, in an area between [[Tierra de Campos]], also known as ''Campi Gothorum'', around Central [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], and Toledo to the east and south.

It is certain (through contemporary Spanish accounts) that they founded four, and a possible fifth city is ascribed to them by a later Arabic source. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory.\n\nThe first, [[Reccopolis]], was founded by Liuvigild in 578 after his victory over the Franks, near what is today the tiny village of [[Zorita de los Canes]]. He named it after his son Reccared and built it with Byzantine imitations, containing a palace complex and mint, but it lay in ruins by the 9th century (after the [[Arab]] conquest).\n\nAt a slightly later date, Liuvigild founded a city he named ''Victoriacum'' after his victory over the Basques.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, \"The Barbarian Kingdoms in Gaul and Spain\".</ref> Though it is often supposed to survive as the city of [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]], contemporary 12th-century sources refer to the latter city's foundation by [[Sancho VI of Navarre]].\n\nLiuvigild's son and namesake of the first Visigothic city founded his own sometime around 600.

Visigothic coins attest two types of helmets. First there were [[Spangenhelm]]ets, the most popular type. They are attested on the coins of Leovigild, Chintasuinth, Recceswinth, Wamba, Egica and Wittiza. They were the most common helmet type of the early Middle Ages and remained in use even after the fall of the Visigothic kingdom. The second type appears on a few coins of Ervig, Egica and possibly Leovigild. It seems to be very similar to the Nordic [[Vendel Period|Vendel helmets]]. On one coin the helmet is decorated with a bush of feathers.{{sfn|Reinhart|1951|pp=44\u201346}} Finally, an [[Umayyads|Umayyad]] [[Painting of the Six Kings|painting]] from [[Qusayr Amra]] depicts king Roderic wearing some type of helmet, but due to heavy damage only its top was recognizable.{{sfn|Drayson|2007|p=11}}-->\n\n==List of kings{{anchor|Rulers}}==\n{{The monarchs of the Iberian Peninsula}}\n\n===Terving kings===\nThese kings and leaders&nbsp;\u2013 with the exception of Fritigern and possibly Alavivus&nbsp;\u2013 were pagans.\n*[[Ariaric]]\n*[[Aoric]]\n*[[Athanaric]] (369\u2013381)\n**[[Rothesteus]], sub-king\n**[[Winguric]], sub-king\n*[[Alavivus]] (c. 376), rebel against Valens\n*[[Fritigern]] (c. 376\u2013c. 380), rebel against Athanaric and Valens\n\n===Balti dynasty===\nThese kings were [[Arians]] (followers of the theological teaching of [[Arius]]).

(Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.

The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies.

The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

It&nbsp;began on August&nbsp;21, when [[Randy Weaver]], members of his immediate family, and family friend Kevin Harris resisted deputies of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and the [[Hostage Rescue Team]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI HRT).\n\nDuring a Marshals Service reconnoiter of the Weaver property pursuant to a bench warrant for Weaver after his [[failure to appear]] on firearms charges, an initial encounter between six U.S. Marshals and the Weavers resulted in a [[shootout]] and the deaths of deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, age 42, the Weavers' son Samuel (Sammy), age 14, and the Weavers' family dog (Striker). In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's 43-year-old wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred on the first two days of the operation. The siege and stand-off were ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators, with the surrender and arrest of Kevin Harris on August 30, and the surrender of Randy Weaver and the surviving Weaver children the next day.\n\nWeaver and Harris were subsequently arraigned on a variety of federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder for the death of Degan. Harris was acquitted of all charges, and Weaver was subsequently acquitted of all charges except for the original bail condition violation for the arms charges and for having missed his original court date. He was fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison, credited with time served plus an additional three months, then released.<ref name=\"nyt18\">{{cite news|title=18 Months in Jail for White Supremacist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/19/us/18-months-in-jail-for-supremacist.html|accessdate=July 22, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"jess\">{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=Jess|title=Ruby Ridge: The Truth and Tragedy of the Randy Weaver Family|date=2002|publisher=ReganBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0060007942|edition=1st trade pbk.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of \"criminal wrongdoing\" against the agencies involved in the incident, in particular, the FBI, the USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice's]] [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) to investigate Spence's charges. A redacted [[HTML]] version of the RRTF report was publicly released by Lexis Counsel Connect, an information service for attorneys, which raised questions about the conduct and policies of all of the participating agencies.

The evolution of that profile was later criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n<blockquote>The Subcommittee is ... concerned that, as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided, they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose. If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver, they never recorded their assessments. Thus, rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a [[living document]], the Marshals added new reports to an ever-expanding file, and their overall assessment never really changed. These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first-hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Company|first1=Diane Publishing|title=Ruby Ridge: Report of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOy-7sG5CVEC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=as+Marshals+investigating+the+Weaver+case+learned#v=onepage&q=as%20Marshals%20investigating%20the%20Weaver%20case%20learned&f=false|publisher=Diane Publishing|accessdate=July 22, 2017|year=1996|isbn=978-0788129766}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the people used by the marshals as third party go-betweens on the Weaver case\u2014Bill and Judy Grider, Alan Jeppeson, [[Richard Butler (white supremacist)|Richard Butler]]\u2014were evaluated by the marshals as more radical than the Weavers themselves.

Whenever feasible, verbal warnings should be given before deadly force is applied.}}\n\nThis was in stark contrast to the permissive ROE adopted for the Ruby Ridge stand-off.<ref name=\"permissive\">{{cite web|last1=Lardner Jr|first1=George|last2=Lei|first2=Richard|title=Permissive Rules of Engagement' at Issue in Ruby Ridge Shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/07/14/permissive-rules-of-engagement-at-issue-in-ruby-ridge-shooting/41005d73-b0cd-4104-ac25-e6b02d27e734/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 23, 2017|date=July 14, 1995}}</ref><ref name=WalterEveryKnee98>{{ cite book|author=Walter, Jess|year=1996|orig-year=1995|title=Every Knee Shall Bow: The Truth and Tragedy of Ruby Ridge and the Randy Weaver Family|page=[https://archive.org/details/everykneeshallbo00walt/page/190 190]|location=New York|publisher=HarperPaperbacks|isbn=0-06-101131-2|url=https://archive.org/details/everykneeshallbo00walt|url-access=registration|access-date=February 7, 2017}} The link to this title is to the 1996 edition.</ref>\n\n===Deployment of sniper/observers, ROE understanding===\nOn August 22, the second day of the siege, between 2:30\u2013\u20603:30 pm, the FBI HRT sniper/observer teams were briefed and deployed to the cabin on foot.<ref name=\"p520\"/> According to the RRTF report to the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], there were various views and interpretations taken of these ROEs by members of FBI SWAT teams in action at the Ruby Ridge site, including describing them as \"severe\" and \"inappropriate\" (Denver SWAT team leader Gregory Sexton), and as \"strong\" and a \"departure from the ... standard deadly force policy\", as \"inappropriate\", and of a sort he \"had never been given\" before (two members of the Denver SWAT team). The latter of these two members stated further that \"other SWAT team members were taken aback by the Rules and that most of them clung to the FBI's standard deadly force policy,\" and a further team member responded to the briefing on the ROE with \"[y]ou've gotta be kidding.\"<ref name=RRTF_OPR_IVF2c_fns614616>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (1994), Ch.

Examples included HRT sniper Dale Monroe, who saw the ROE as a \"green light\" to shoot armed adult males on sight, and HRT sniper Edward Wenger who believed that if he observed armed adults, he could use deadly force, but he was to follow standard deadly force policy for all other individuals. Fred Lanceley, the FBI Hostage Negotiator at Ruby Ridge, was \"surprised and shocked\" at the ROE, the most severe rules he had ever heard in his over 300 hostage situations, and characterized the ROE as being inconsistent with standard policy.<ref name=RRTF_OPR_IVF2ag>RRTF, ''Report of the RRTF to the OPR'' (1994), Ch.

It&nbsp;began on August&nbsp;21, when [[Randy Weaver]], members of his immediate family, and family friend Kevin Harris resisted deputies of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and the [[Hostage Rescue Team]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI HRT).\n\nDuring a Marshals Service reconnoiter of the Weaver property pursuant to a bench warrant for Weaver after his [[failure to appear]] on firearms charges, an initial encounter between six U.S. Marshals and the Weavers resulted in a [[shootout]] and the deaths of deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, age 42, the Weavers' son Samuel (Sammy), age 14, and the Weavers' family dog (Striker). In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's 43-year-old wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred on the first two days of the operation. The siege and stand-off were ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators, with the surrender and arrest of Kevin Harris on August 30, and the surrender of Randy Weaver and the surviving Weaver children the next day.\n\nWeaver and Harris were subsequently arraigned on a variety of federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder for the death of Degan. Harris was acquitted of all charges, and Weaver was subsequently acquitted of all charges except for the original bail condition violation for the arms charges and for having missed his original court date. He was fined [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison, credited with time served plus an additional three months, then released.<ref name=\"nyt18\">{{cite news|title=18 Months in Jail for White Supremacist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/19/us/18-months-in-jail-for-supremacist.html|accessdate=July 22, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"jess\">{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=Jess|title=Ruby Ridge: The Truth and Tragedy of the Randy Weaver Family|date=2002|publisher=ReganBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0060007942|edition=1st trade pbk.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of \"criminal wrongdoing\" against the agencies involved in the incident, in particular, the FBI, the USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice's]] [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) to investigate Spence's charges. A redacted [[HTML]] version of the RRTF report was publicly released by Lexis Counsel Connect, an information service for attorneys, which raised questions about the conduct and policies of all of the participating agencies.

The evolution of that profile was later criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n<blockquote>The Subcommittee is ... concerned that, as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided, they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose. If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver, they never recorded their assessments. Thus, rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a [[living document]], the Marshals added new reports to an ever-expanding file, and their overall assessment never really changed. These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first-hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Company|first1=Diane Publishing|title=Ruby Ridge: Report of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOy-7sG5CVEC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=as+Marshals+investigating+the+Weaver+case+learned#v=onepage&q=as%20Marshals%20investigating%20the%20Weaver%20case%20learned&f=false|publisher=Diane Publishing|accessdate=July 22, 2017|year=1996|isbn=978-0788129766}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the people used by the marshals as third party go-betweens on the Weaver case\u2014Bill and Judy Grider, Alan Jeppeson, [[Richard Butler (white supremacist)|Richard Butler]]\u2014were evaluated by the marshals as more radical than the Weavers themselves.
