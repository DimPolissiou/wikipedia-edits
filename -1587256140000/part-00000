They began working in parallel on two projects that would result in the production 350 GT. First, they began de-tuning the original Bizzarrini engine and redesigning the original Bizzarrini chassis for street use.<ref name=\":0\" /> Second, they started readying the 350 GTV for its late-October 1963 [[Turin Auto Show]] debut, where Lamborghini hoped it would raise interest in the eventual production 350 GT.<ref name=\"Pasini_GTV\">Pasini, Stefano \"Lamborghini 350 GTV.\" Rivista Lamborghini Review, 1991</ref>\n===Redesigning the GTV Prototype===\nThe 350&nbsp;GT shared a number of features with the 350&nbsp;GTV prototype, including a four-wheel [[independent suspension]], the quad-cam 3.5 liter [[Lamborghini V12]], and an aluminium body. A number of mechanical revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace.  The body was redesigned by Carrozzeria Touring, retaining the original profile while cleaning up details of the design to result in a more cohesive appearance.  Most noticeable was the replacement of the prototype's rotating [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlights]] with fixed headlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs equipped to the 350 GTV, the Bizzarrini-designed 3.5 liter V12 was essentially a race motor, potentially developing {{Convert|400|hp|kW}} at 11,000rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.400gt.com/articles/EarlyLambo/Biz_Honda.htm|title=The Lamborghini V-12: A Japanese Connection?|last=Lyons|first=Pete|date=1988|website=excerpt from \"The Complete Book of Lamborghini|publisher=Beekman House|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925104412/http://www.400gt.com/articles/EarlyLambo/Biz_Honda.htm|archive-date=25 September 2018|access-date=}}</ref>  In order to fit his grand touring car with a smoother, more pleasant, longer-lasting engine that would be \"good for 40,000 hard miles between services,\" Ferruccio had Dallara and Wallace de-tune a version of this prototype GTV motor for street use.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This included:\n\n*Replacing the elaborate and costly racing-style [[Dry sump|dry sump oiling system]] with a conventional [[Wet sump|wet sump system]]\n*Reducing the [[compression ratio]] from 11.0:1 or above to 9.4:1\n*Cutting back on the exotic materials specified for the [[crankshaft]] and other components to reduce cost\n*Relocating the [[Distributor|distributors]] to more accessible positions on the fronts of the exhaust [[Camshaft|camshafts]]\n*Adoption of a single, very tall Lamborghini-made [[oil filter]]\n*Replacing the expensive 36&nbsp;mm down-draft racing [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] with conventional, inexpensive side-draft 40 DCOE Webers.

The GTV chassis was unsuitable for a street car due to its lightweight construction and small door openings obstructed by tubing. Dallara's redesign for the production 350 GT used larger {{Convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} square-section steel tubing in a central \"floor\", with front and rear cradles made from {{Convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} tubing to support the engine, rear differential and suspension mountings. This design provided easy entry and exit through the doors, aided in the quietness of the car, and provided a solid platform on which to mount the body.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Suspension===\n\nThe suspension was fully independent, with unequal-length wishbones and [[coilover]] shock absorbers. In the rear, the coilover assembly was located to the rear of the suspension wishbone mountings. The rear suspension wishbones were asymmetrical front-to-back, with an offset that brought the rear wheel hubs towards the spring mountings.<ref name=\":0\" /> This arrangement provided increased resistance to [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and improved stability during acceleration and braking.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Anti-roll bar|Anti-roll bars]] were equipped on front and rear.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Engine===\n\nQuality control of the early {{convert|3464|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engines was very high.

They began working in parallel on two projects that would result in the production 350 GT. First, they began de-tuning the original Bizzarrini engine and redesigning the original Bizzarrini chassis for street use.<ref name=\":0\" /> Second, they started readying the 350 GTV for its late-October 1963 [[Turin Auto Show]] debut, where Lamborghini hoped it would raise interest in the eventual production 350 GT.<ref name=\"Pasini_GTV\">Pasini, Stefano \"Lamborghini 350 GTV.\" Rivista Lamborghini Review, 1991</ref>\n===Redesigning the GTV Prototype===\nThe 350&nbsp;GT shared a number of features with the 350&nbsp;GTV prototype, including a four-wheel [[independent suspension]], the quad-cam 3.5 liter [[Lamborghini V12]], and an aluminium body. A number of mechanical revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace.  The body was redesigned by Carrozzeria Touring, retaining the original profile while cleaning up details of the design to result in a more cohesive appearance.  Most noticeable was the replacement of the prototype's rotating [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlights]] with fixed headlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs equipped to the 350 GTV, the Bizzarrini-designed 3.5 liter V12 was essentially a race motor, potentially developing {{Convert|400|hp|kW}} at 11,000rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.400gt.com/articles/EarlyLambo/Biz_Honda.htm|title=The Lamborghini V-12: A Japanese Connection?|last=Lyons|first=Pete|date=1988|website=excerpt from \"The Complete Book of Lamborghini|publisher=Beekman House|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925104412/http://www.400gt.com/articles/EarlyLambo/Biz_Honda.htm|archive-date=25 September 2018|access-date=}}</ref>  In order to fit his grand touring car with a smoother, more pleasant, longer-lasting engine that would be \"good for 40,000 hard miles between services,\" Ferruccio had Dallara and Wallace de-tune a version of this prototype GTV motor for street use.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This included:\n\n*Replacing the elaborate and costly racing-style [[Dry sump|dry sump oiling system]] with a conventional [[Wet sump|wet sump system]]\n*Reducing the [[compression ratio]] from 11.0:1 or above to 9.4:1\n*Cutting back on the exotic materials specified for the [[crankshaft]] and other components to reduce cost\n*Relocating the [[Distributor|distributors]] to more accessible positions on the fronts of the exhaust [[Camshaft|camshafts]]\n*Adoption of a single, very tall Lamborghini-made [[oil filter]]\n*Replacing the expensive 36&nbsp;mm down-draft racing [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] with conventional, inexpensive side-draft 40 DCOE Webers.

It had an aluminium body, a Salisbury [[limited-slip differential]], four-wheel independent suspension, and [[vacuum servo]]-assisted [[Girling brakes|Girling]] [[disc brake]]s all round.

The GTV chassis was unsuitable for a street car due to its lightweight construction and small door openings obstructed by tubing. Dallara's redesign for the production 350 GT used larger {{Convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} square-section steel tubing in a central \"floor\", with front and rear cradles made from {{Convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} tubing to support the engine, rear differential and suspension mountings. This design provided easy entry and exit through the doors, aided in the quietness of the car, and provided a solid platform on which to mount the body.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Suspension===\n\nThe suspension was fully independent, with unequal-length wishbones and [[coilover]] shock absorbers. In the rear, the coilover assembly was located to the rear of the suspension wishbone mountings. The rear suspension wishbones were asymmetrical front-to-back, with an offset that brought the rear wheel hubs towards the spring mountings.<ref name=\":0\" /> This arrangement provided increased resistance to [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and improved stability during acceleration and braking.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Anti-roll bar|Anti-roll bars]] were equipped on front and rear.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Engine===\n\nQuality control of the early {{convert|3464|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engines was very high.

It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building. The word ''vane'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''fana'', meaning 'flag'.\n\nAlthough partly functional, weather vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional [[chicken|cockerel]] design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows and horses. Not all weather vanes have pointers. When the wind is sufficiently strong, the head of the arrow or cockerel (or equivalent depending on the chosen design) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing.\n\nThe weather vane was independently invented in ancient China and Greece around the same time during the 2nd century BCE. The earliest written reference to a weather vane appears in the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and a weather vane was fitted on top of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe oldest textual reference to a weather vane comes from the ancient Chinese  text '[Huainanzi]' dating from around 139 BC, which describes a \"wind-observing fan\" (''hou feng shan'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4faf\u98a8\u6247}}).<ref name=\"Needham\"/>  The [[Tower of the Winds]] on the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ''[[agora]]'' in [[Athens]] once bore on its roof a weather vane in the form of a bronze [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] holding a rod in his outstretched hand, rotating as the wind changed direction. Below this was a [[frieze]] adorned with the eight Greek wind deities. The eight-metre-high structure also featured [[sundial]]s, and a [[water clock]] inside. It dates from around 50 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Joseph V. |last2=Price  |first2=Derek J. de Solla |authorlink2=Derek J. de Solla Price |date=October 1968 |title=The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |publisher= |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=345\u2013355 (353) |doi=10.2307/503828 |jstor=503828}}</ref>\n\nMilitary documents from the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China (220\u2013280) refer to the weather vane as \"five ounces\" (''wu liang'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4e94\u5169}}), named after the weight of its materials.<ref name=\"Needham\">{{Citation |last=Needham |first=Joseph|last2=Ling|first2=Wang|volume=Vol. 3|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=478|year=1959}}</ref> By the 3rd century, Chinese weather vanes were shaped like birds and took the name of \"wind-indicating bird\" (''[[Xiangfeng wu|xiang feng wu]]'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u76f8\u98a8\u70cf}}). The ''Sanfu huangtu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4e09\u8f14\u9ec3\u5716}}), a 3rd-century book written by Miao Changyan about the palaces at [[Chang'an]], describes a bird-shaped weather vane situated on a tower roof, which was possibly also an [[anemometer]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Han 'Ling Tai' (Observatory Platform)  was  eight  ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''  north-west of Chang'an.  It was called 'Ling  Tai' because  it was originally intended for observations of the [[Yin and Yang|Yin and the Yang]] and the changes occurring in the celestial bodies, but in the Han it began to be called Qing Tai. Guo Yuansheng, in his  ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), says  that south of the palaces there was a Ling Tai, fifteen ''ren'' (120 feet) high,\nupon the top of which  was  the [[armillary sphere]] made by [[Zhang Heng]]. Also there was a wind-indicating bronze bird  (''xiang feng tong wu''),  which  was  moved by the wind; and it was said that the bird moved when a 1000-''li'' wind was\nblowing. There was also a bronze gnomon 8 feet high, with a 13 feet long and 1 foot 2 inches broad. According to an  inscription, this was set up in the 4th year of the Taichu reign-period (101 BCE).<ref name=\"Needham\"/> \n</blockquote>\n\nThe oldest surviving weather vane with the shape of a rooster is the ''Gallo di Ramperto'', made in 820 CE and now preserved in the [[Museo di Santa Giulia]] in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]].<ref>Rossana Prestini, ''Vicende faustiniane'', in AA.VV.,''La chiesa e il monastero benedettino di San Faustino Maggiore in Brescia'', Gruppo Banca Lombarda, La Scuola, Brescia 1999, p. 243</ref><ref>Fedele Savio, ''Gli antichi vescovi d'Italia.

An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy's [[Admiralty]] building in London \u2013 the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met.\n\nModern ''aerovanes'' combine the directional vane with an [[anemometer]] (a device for measuring wind speed). Co-locating both instruments allows them to use the same axis (a vertical rod) and provides a co-ordinated readout .\n\n==World's largest weather vane==\nAccording to the [[Guinness World Records]], the [[world's largest weather vane]] is a [[T\u00edo Pepe]] [[sherry]] advertisement located in [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]], [[Spain]]. The city of [[Montague, Michigan]] also claims to have the largest standard-design weather vane, being a ship and arrow which measures 48 feet tall, with an arrow 26 feet long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p=G4884 |title=The World's Largest Weather Vane -  Ella Ellenwood|date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>\n\nA challenger for the title of world's largest weather vane is located in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]].

Located at the Yukon Transportation Museum<ref>[http://www.goytm.ca goytm.ca]</ref> beside [[Whitehorse International Airport]], the weather vane is used by pilots to determine wind direction, used as a landmark by tourists and enjoyed by locals.

It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building. The word ''vane'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''fana'', meaning 'flag'.\n\nAlthough partly functional, weather vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional [[chicken|cockerel]] design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows and horses. Not all weather vanes have pointers. When the wind is sufficiently strong, the head of the arrow or cockerel (or equivalent depending on the chosen design) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing.\n\nThe weather vane was independently invented in ancient China and Greece around the same time during the 2nd century BCE. The earliest written reference to a weather vane appears in the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and a weather vane was fitted on top of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe oldest textual reference to a weather vane comes from the ancient Chinese  text ''[[Huainanzi]]'' dating from around 139 BC, which describes a \"wind-observing fan\" (''hou feng shan'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4faf\u98a8\u6247}}).<ref name=\"Needham\"/>  The [[Tower of the Winds]] on the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ''[[agora]]'' in [[Athens]] once bore on its roof a weather vane in the form of a bronze [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] holding a rod in his outstretched hand, rotating as the wind changed direction. Below this was a [[frieze]] adorned with the eight Greek wind deities. The eight-metre-high structure also featured [[sundial]]s, and a [[water clock]] inside. It dates from around 50 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Joseph V. |last2=Price  |first2=Derek J. de Solla |authorlink2=Derek J. de Solla Price |date=October 1968 |title=The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |publisher= |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=345\u2013355 (353) |doi=10.2307/503828 |jstor=503828}}</ref>\n\nMilitary documents from the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China (220\u2013280) refer to the weather vane as \"five ounces\" (''wu liang'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4e94\u5169}}), named after the weight of its materials.<ref name=\"Needham\">{{Citation |last=Needham |first=Joseph|last2=Ling|first2=Wang|volume=Vol. 3|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=478|year=1959}}</ref> By the 3rd century, Chinese weather vanes were shaped like birds and took the name of \"wind-indicating bird\" (''[[Xiangfeng wu|xiang feng wu]]'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u76f8\u98a8\u70cf}}). The ''Sanfu huangtu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u4e09\u8f14\u9ec3\u5716}}), a 3rd-century book written by Miao Changyan about the palaces at [[Chang'an]], describes a bird-shaped weather vane situated on a tower roof, which was possibly also an [[anemometer]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Han 'Ling Tai' (Observatory Platform)  was  eight  ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''  north-west of Chang'an.  It was called 'Ling  Tai' because  it was originally intended for observations of the [[Yin and Yang|Yin and the Yang]] and the changes occurring in the celestial bodies, but in the Han it began to be called Qing Tai. Guo Yuansheng, in his  ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), says  that south of the palaces there was a Ling Tai, fifteen ''ren'' (120 feet) high,\nupon the top of which  was  the [[armillary sphere]] made by [[Zhang Heng]]. Also there was a wind-indicating bronze bird  (''xiang feng tong wu''),  which  was  moved by the wind; and it was said that the bird moved when a 1000-''li'' wind was\nblowing. There was also a bronze gnomon 8 feet high, with a 13 feet long and 1 foot 2 inches broad. According to an  inscription, this was set up in the 4th year of the Taichu reign-period (101 BCE).<ref name=\"Needham\"/> \n</blockquote>\n\nThe oldest surviving weather vane with the shape of a rooster is the ''Gallo di Ramperto'', made in 820 CE and now preserved in the [[Museo di Santa Giulia]] in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]].<ref>Rossana Prestini, ''Vicende faustiniane'', in AA.VV.,''La chiesa e il monastero benedettino di San Faustino Maggiore in Brescia'', Gruppo Banca Lombarda, La Scuola, Brescia 1999, p. 243</ref><ref>Fedele Savio, ''Gli antichi vescovi d'Italia.

An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy's [[Admiralty]] building in London \u2013 the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met.\n\nModern ''aerovanes'' combine the directional vane with an [[anemometer]] (a device for measuring wind speed). Co-locating both instruments allows them to use the same axis (a vertical rod) and provides a co-ordinated readout .\n\n==World's largest weather vane==\nAccording to the [[Guinness World Records]], the [[world's largest weather vane]] is a [[T\u00edo Pepe]] [[sherry]] advertisement located in [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]], [[Spain]]. The city of [[Montague, Michigan]] also claims to have the largest standard-design weather vane, being a ship and arrow which measures 48 feet tall, with an arrow 26 feet long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p=G4884 |title=The World's Largest Weather Vane -  Ella Ellenwood|date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>\n\nA challenger for the title of world's largest weather vane is located in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]]. The weather vane is a retired [[Douglas DC-3]] CF-CPY atop a swiveling support. Located at the Yukon Transportation Museum<ref>[http://www.goytm.ca goytm.ca]</ref> beside [[Whitehorse International Airport]], the weather vane is used by pilots to determine wind direction, used as a landmark by tourists and enjoyed by locals.
