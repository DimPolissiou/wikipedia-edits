It was ruled by three consecutive dynasties: [[Archaeanactids|Archaenactidae]] (480 BC&nbsp;\u2013 438 BC), Spartocids (438 BC&nbsp;\u2013 108 BC), and Pontids (108 BC&nbsp;\u2013 16 BC).

They either took over or assimilated with the local [[Early East Slavs|Slavic tribes]]. The Goths were in turn pushed out by aggressively encroaching [[Huns]], about 375. The Goths went on to conquer [[Southern Europe]] and the Huns moved to the Balkans and created a [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic Empire]] which lasted for a hundred years. After splitting of the Empire, some of the Huns moved back north in the territories of modern Ukraine and formed Patria Onoguria, now known as [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. In the 7th century Onoguria largely defected to [[Khazaria]]&nbsp;\u2013 an expanding Turkic state centered in the North [[Caucuses]] which controlled the Eurasian steppe until the 9th century.\n\n===Gothic rulers===\n{{Main|Chernyakhov culture}}\n\nIn 238, the Goths for the first time passed the Danube, and took to the Black Sea.

The [[Bosporan Kingdom|kingdom]] was established around 480 BC. It was ruled by three consecutive dynasties: [[Archaeanactids|Archaenactidae]] (480 BC&nbsp;\u2013 438 BC), Spartocids (438 BC&nbsp;\u2013 108 BC), and Pontids (108 BC&nbsp;\u2013 16 BC).

They either took over or assimilated with the local [[Early East Slavs|Slavic tribes]]. The Goths were in turn pushed out by aggressively encroaching [[Huns]], about 375. The Goths went on to conquer [[Southern Europe]] and the Huns moved to the Balkans and created a [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic Empire]] which lasted for a hundred years. After splitting of the Empire, some of the Huns moved back north in the territories of modern Ukraine and formed Patria Onoguria, now known as [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. In the 7th century Onoguria largely defected to [[Khazaria]]&nbsp;\u2013 an expanding Turkic state centered in the North [[Caucuses]] which controlled the Eurasian steppe until the 9th century.\n\n===Gothic rulers===\n{{Main|Chernyakhov culture}}\n\nIn 238, the Goths for the first time passed the Danube, and took to the Black Sea.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model.

The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The film is based on the biography of an 18th-century master painter of the same name belonging to the region. It premiered at the 67th Venice Film Festival, was presented in the \u2018World Cinema Spotlight\u2019 section of the San Francisco Film Festival, was showcased in MoMA, New York and travelled widely to many festivals including Rotterdam, Beijing and Vancouver Film Festivals among others. The \u2018Film Comment\u2019 magazine had rated \u2018''Nainsukh''\u2019 as one of the top ten films of the 67th Venice film festival.\n\n''Nainsukh'' has received a great deal of appreciation from both film and art critics. Prof. Dr. [[Milo C. Beach]], the eminent American art historian, director emeritus Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC., author of several authoritative books on Indian paintings wrote:\n\n\"The images of NAINSUKH are stunning. The comparisons with the paintings could not be more clear, but what astonishes me most is the ability of Amit Dutta to compose those images, and even more, to light them. The lighting is breathtaking. It tells you why Nainsukh would have taken such care with details, maybe especially with the folds of cloth\u2026I think that this will do more for public interest in Indian painting that all the many scholarly essays.... What an achievement!\" (If I were teaching, I would buy a copy of the film immediately to show in every class... )\n\n''Nainsukh'' has been widely discussed by critics for its unique formal qualities which evade categorisations.

It's foreword is written by art-historian Partha Mitter.\n\n=== Other works ===\n\nAfter graduating from the film school in 2004, he spent many months interviewing painters from the [[Gondi people|Gond]] tribal community of [[Madhya Pradesh]], who had migrated to the city of Bhopal following the success and untimely demise of one pioneering young Gond artist \u2018[[Jangarh Singh Shyam]]\u2019. It resulted in a film \u2018Jangarh Film-One\u2019, which revolves around his absence amidst his legacy in the contemporary art practice of his kin.\n\nHe also made a feature-length documentary \u2018''Ramkhind'', a meditative observation of the everyday life of the people in a [[Warli]] village, which has produced some of the finest contemporary painters in its distinctive folk idiom.\n\nSince Nainsukh in 2010, Amit Dutta\u2019s area of interest has focused more specifically towards the art-historical and cultural aspects of the Kangra Valley and the surrounding area, most of his recent work being based in the same region.<ref name=\"labiennale1\"/>\n\nIn the years 2011\u201312, Amit Dutta recorded extensive conversations with another eminent Indian art-historian Dr.B.N.Goswamy, an authority on [[Pahari painting|Pahari Art]], for the production of an archive of his works in twenty volumes. Created during the archiving process are two shorts: \u2018The Museum of Imagination\u2019 and \u2018Field-trip\u2019.\n\n\u2018The Museum of Imagination, A Portrait in Absentia\u2019, is an abstract portrait of the art-historian. This film was first shown at the Rome Film Festival and then Rotterdam and Oberhausen Film Festivals subsequently.

While the film exudes precision and grace, its admiration and respect for its subject is awakened outward, never venerated into stasis.

The film is based on the biography of an 18th-century master painter of the same name belonging to the region. It premiered at the 67th Venice Film Festival, was presented in the \u2018World Cinema Spotlight\u2019 section of the San Francisco Film Festival, was showcased in MoMA, New York and travelled widely to many festivals including Rotterdam, Beijing and Vancouver Film Festivals among others. The \u2018Film Comment\u2019 magazine had rated \u2018''Nainsukh''\u2019 as one of the top ten films of the 67th Venice film festival.\n\n''Nainsukh'' has received a great deal of appreciation from both film and art critics. Prof. Dr. [[Milo C. Beach]], the eminent American art historian, director emeritus Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC., author of several authoritative books on Indian paintings wrote:\n\n\"The images of NAINSUKH are stunning. The comparisons with the paintings could not be more clear, but what astonishes me most is the ability of Amit Dutta to compose those images, and even more, to light them. The lighting is breathtaking. It tells you why Nainsukh would have taken such care with details, maybe especially with the folds of cloth\u2026I think that this will do more for public interest in Indian painting that all the many scholarly essays.... What an achievement!\" (If I were teaching, I would buy a copy of the film immediately to show in every class... )\n\n''Nainsukh'' has been widely discussed by critics for its unique formal qualities which evade categorisations. The film is said to be balancing between documentary approach and playful plot, developing its own visual language by interpreting as well as questioning Indian art history and one of its greatest artists.<ref name=\"doku-arts1\"/>  While deeply rooted in Indian tradition and philosophy,<ref>{{cite web|title=www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/films/nainsukh|url=http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/films/nainsukh/}}</ref> the film is also seen by eminent critic Olaf Moller as a \u201cthought-provoking investigation into the slippery, ever-changing nature of realism, its representation in the arts.

Galina Stoletneya remarks that \"By harmoniously juxtaposing the gorgeous visuals with outstanding sound design, the filmmaker produces a unique work of art\u2014a living painting itself\u2014that stands on its own\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stoletneya|first=Galina|title=Nainsukh |url=http://fest11.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=66}}</ref>\n\nMax Goldberg of San Francisco Film Society observes that the film pays close attention to the finesse of Naisukh's brushwork and his observant images of the patron's more informal moments like smoking and beard-trimming. He adds that \u201cWhen the filmmaker reconstructs one of Nainsukh\u2019s more complexly staged scenes\u2014as in the hunting of a tiger clutching its human prey\u2014his cinematic technique of isolating different elements of a single scene evokes the dynamic register of imagination and realism animating the artist\u2019s deceptively flat pictures.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldberg |first=Max |title=Swimming in the Deep End of San Francisco International Film Festival |url=http://www.sf360.org/?pageid=13521 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127225423/http://sf360.org/?pageid=13521 |archive-date=27 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Ferroni Brigade group of film critics had nominated it as one of the best films of the 67th Venice film festival.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Golden Donkey Venice 2010|url=http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/the-golden-donkey-venice-2010|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Kaljayi Kambakht]]'''- <big>'''Novel (2016)'''</big>\n\nHis first novel in Hindi [[Kaljayi Kambakht]] was published in 2016.

It resulted in a film \u2018Jangarh Film-One\u2019, which revolves around his absence amidst his legacy in the contemporary art practice of his kin.\n\nHe also made a feature-length documentary \u2018''Ramkhind'', a meditative observation of the everyday life of the people in a [[Warli]] village, which has produced some of the finest contemporary painters in its distinctive folk idiom.\n\nSince Nainsukh in 2010, Amit Dutta\u2019s area of interest has focused more specifically towards the art-historical and cultural aspects of the Kangra Valley and the surrounding area, most of his recent work being based in the same region.<ref name=\"labiennale1\"/>\n\nIn the years 2011\u201312, Amit Dutta recorded extensive conversations with another eminent Indian art-historian Dr.B.N.Goswamy, an authority on [[Pahari painting|Pahari Art]], for the production of an archive of his works in twenty volumes. Created during the archiving process are two shorts: \u2018The Museum of Imagination\u2019 and \u2018Field-trip\u2019.\n\n\u2018The Museum of Imagination, A Portrait in Absentia\u2019, is an abstract portrait of the art-historian. This film was first shown at the Rome Film Festival and then Rotterdam and Oberhausen Film Festivals subsequently. Rotterdam called it an extraordinary, intriguing and unconventional portrait.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum of imagination|url=http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/en/films/museum-of-imagination}}</ref>\n\nAndrea Picard, Chief Curator of \"Wavelengths\", the Toronto International Film Festival's celebrated avant-garde section, and a columnist for Cinema Scope magazine wrote about the film that \u201cDutta continues his exploration of Indian art history and culture...The quietude in the film \u2014 the quest to understand the silences as much as the conversation \u2014 speaks volumes about the weight of art and creativity... While the film exudes precision and grace, its admiration and respect for its subject is awakened outward, never venerated into stasis. Studying art is a way of seeing the world; the film's official subtitle, \"portrait in absentia\" suggests infinitude as Dutta's discerning eye alludes to the images that will forever remain lodged in our memory spurring us on as a life force.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=slow criticism, Tiger Shorts Competition|url=http://www.filmkrant.nl/slowcriticism_2013/8626|access-date=27 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510135800/http://www.filmkrant.nl/slowcriticism_2013/8626|archive-date=10 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Screenings ==\n\nAmit Dutta\u2019s films have been screened at various museums and film festivals:\n\nMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA New York),  Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York),  Centre Pompidou(Paris), Tate London (London), Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA)[https://bampfa.org/program/amit-dutta%E2%80%99s-cinematic-museum], The Academy of Arts of (Berlin), The Deutsches Historisches Museum (Berlin),  Weatherspoon Art Museum(NC), Reitberg Museum (Zurich),  Chandigarh Museum and art gallery (Chandigarh), Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin), National Gallery of Modern Art NGMA (New Delhi).\n\nVenice Film festival, Berlin Film festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, \nSan Francisco Film festival, Torronto International Film festival(TIFF Bell Lightbox),<ref>https://www.savac.net/nainsukh/</ref> Oberhausen Film festival, Viennale, Cinema Du Reel,\nRome Film festival, Beijing Film festival, Bilbao International Film Festival Spain, Mumbai International Film festival, IFFI- International Film festival of India, Belfort Entreveus Film Festival (France), IDSFFK (Kerala), Media art festival, Osnabrueck (Germany), 25 Fps (Zagreb), Jeonju Film Festival (Korea), Vancouver International Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schemamag.ca/2011/10/04/viff_2011_nainsukh/#.WHzyoZIV3dQ|title=VIFF 2011 -

A commonly used starting system for horse races was devised in the mid nineteenth century by [[Henry John Rous|Admiral Rous]], a steward of the [[Jockey Club]] and public [[Handicapping|handicapper]].  A starter, standing alongside the jockeys and horses, dropped his flag to signal the start. An assistant some 100 yards down the course raised a second flag to indicate false starts.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\">{{cite book | last = Peake | first = Wayne | title = Unregistered proprietary horse racing in Sydney 1888-1942 | year = 2004 | access-date = 2006-04-17 | publisher = Australian Digital Theses Program (University of Western Sydney) | pages = 141\u2013184 | chapter = Chapter 4: Programming and conducting unregistered proprietary horse racing | chapterurl = http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/uploads/approved/adt-NUWS20050817.163106/public/06Chapter4.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060906160608/http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/uploads/approved/adt-NUWS20050817.163106/public/06Chapter4.pdf | archive-date = 2006-09-06 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nAn official starter might be well paid, but his duties were very demanding. Early in the twentieth century, he was supported by perhaps a single assistant who primed the spring-barrier, as well as the clerk of the course.  In the present day there are many attendants to steady runners from super-structured barrier stalls.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/>\n\n[[Image:Horseracestart1952.jpg|thumb|A strand barrier start of a horse race in [[South Australia]] in 1952]]\nThe first horse racing starting barriers were simple ropes or occasionally wooden barriers behind which the horses stood.  The first automated design was pioneered in [[Australia]] and was first used at an official race meeting in 1894.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.nma.gov.au/about_us/nma_corporate_documents/annual_report/03_04/part_5/appendix_3_acquisitions_-_national_historical_collection_page_3_of_3 | title = National Museum of Australia: Annual Report 2003-2004 Part 5 - Appendices; Appendix 3, Acquisitions - National Historical Collection (page 3 of 3) | publisher = National Museum of Australia | accessdate = 2011-01-05}}</ref>  Alexander Gray had concluded that the flapping of a starter's flag distracted the horses.  An impetus for his invention was a \u00a35 fine received by his son, Reuben, a jockey, for allowing his mount to step over the white chalk line that marked the start.  His machine was first tried out at [[City of Canterbury, New South Wales#Attractions|Canterbury Park Racecourse in New South Wales]] in February 1894.  Gray's prototype consisted of a single strand of wire at about the height of the horse's head that was attached to a spring at either end. When the device was activated the barrier sprang up and away from the horses.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/>  Gray's single-strand barrier was among those first used. Versions of barriers designed by Alexander and Reuben Gray were installed at race tracks in Australia and overseas between 1894 and about 1932. By the 1920s the single strand barrier had evolved into a spring-powered five-strand device designed by Johnstone and Gleeson, but based on Gray's prototype, that resembled a strongman's chest expander.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/> Barriers assured fair starts to races. Fair race starts encouraged owners to enter horses in races and punters to bet, and they contributed to changing horse racing from a social sporting event into a billion dollar industry.\n\nThe inventor of the electric starting gate for horse racing is [[Clay Puett]], who was a rider and starter at various tracks in the American West. Puett's device replaced other starting methods which often failed to produce a fair start, with extra judges employed to catch horses who got a jump on the rest of the field.\n\nA transportable starting machine was imported from the [[United States]] to Australia in 1946. It wasn't until 1965 that starting stalls were introduced by the [[Jockey Club]] to [[horseracing in the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news  | first=Greg  | last=Wood  | author=  | url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/story/0,,1745459,00.html  | title=End of an era as Jockey Club falls on own sword  | work=  | publisher=[[The Guardian]]  | pages=  | page=  | date=April 3, 2006  | accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>\n\n10 years ago a European manufacturer ( [[https://fornells.com]] ) designed a new kind of starting gates. When the starting gates developed in USA are considered very robust it is obvious that the size and weight of this kind of starting gates are very heavy and very long. It is not adapted for many [[turf tracks]]. \" we are supplying racetrack for more than 40 years and we have been asked constantly by the racecourses if we could design a new starting gates adapted to wet weather and turf tracks where rails needs to be moved. 1O years ago we finally had our first starting gates manufactured and supplied to answer it \" said David Maizeret, Fornells' CEO. The cost of the maintenance of the turf tracks and the changing in the [[horse racing industry]] revenues encourage racecourse management to investigate for new solutions. The international authorities in Ireland [[HRI]]<ref>{{cite web | year = 2019 | url = https://www.theirishfield.ie/news-hri-continues-to-invest-in-starting-stalls-462178/}}</ref>, [[FranceFrance galop]], Morocco [[SOREC]] or Saudi Arabia [[The Equestrian club of Riyadh]] for instance have now adopted this new generation of starting gates. They was looking for a best economical solution, safe for the horses and jockeys, light to keep the track in good shape and very quiet. But over all, the horse racing industry is now looking for a safe start as the betting is a key point. The new generation answer to this needs. \" Fornells' opening system has been developed to guarantee the most efficient start with easy maintenance and maximum reliability \" says Georges Indrian Jafy, Doctor in sciences and director of Fornells' design office. The improvements to be made and the new developments to come are going to be faster in the coming years in an industry who is in his most important changing period of his history.\n\n==Flat horse racing==\n[[File:Sun Downs starting gate.JPG|thumb|Starting gate detail, looking in from front to back]]\nMany of Puett's actual gates are still in use today at tracks around the world, and all gates are based on his original design. A starting gate is equipped with a number of stalls aligned in a row, usually numbering 12 or 14 for everyday use at tracks. Smaller gates may be used at training facilities for schooling horses, or as an auxiliary gate in addition to the main gate for large-field races such as the [[Kentucky Derby]].\n\nThe gates are suspended from an overhead welded steel [[truss]], supported at each end by wheels with pneumatic tires.  The entire structure is designed to be towed behind a tractor or truck, so that it can be moved about on the racetrack grounds, or towed over highways from place to place.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', {{US patent|6637094}}.</ref>\n\nHorses normally enter from the rear of the stall, with gates locked behind the horse once it is in place; the front gates of the stall are normally closed as the horse is loaded in, though the starting-gate crew may open it in order to entice a horse who balks at entry. Alternately, a horse may be backed into the stall from the front entry, again done in the case of a skittish horse.\n[[File:WoodbineStartGate.jpg|thumb|left|A Woodbine Racetrack starting gate, backside.]]\n\nThe front door of each stall is held closed by an electromagnetic lock. The stall doors are designed to give way in case a horse prematurely attempts to bolt through the front or back, in order to reduce or prevent injury to horse or rider.\n\nWhen the starter is satisfied that all horses are in place and ready to start the race, he presses a button, cutting the electric current, simultaneously opening the front stall doors, ringing a loud bell, and sending a signal to the [[Tote board|totalizator]] system that the race is begun and no more bets should be accepted.\n\nPuett's gate was first used at [[Hastings Racecourse|Exhibition Park]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] in 1939, though the management of [[Bay Meadows Racetrack]] in [[San Mateo, California]] claims that their track was the first to use Puett's gate.<ref>[http://www.baymeadows.com/vuhistory.php?active_main=0%26active_sub=1 BayMeadows.com: Bay Meadows history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404020520/http://www.baymeadows.com/vuhistory.php?active_main=0%26active_sub=1 |date=2008-04-04 }}, accessed 2008-06-06]</ref> By the end of 1940, virtually all major race tracks in the United States used Puett gates.

True Center also has gates in South America, the Caribbean and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile starting gates are standard for [[flat racing]], [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] tracks frequently still use earlier forms of starting barriers.\n\n==Harness racing==\n[[File:Car start at Vermo 040810.jpg|thumb|A mobile starting barrier used to begin an 8-horse heat. In cases where there are more horses, they will be arranged in a row directly after the first line horses]]\nOne of the reasons that [[harness racing]] was less popular than horse racing has been the reservations in gamblers\u2019 minds about the various means of starting trotting races, particularly when bets have been lost before contests were properly under way.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/>  Before mobile starting gates gained popularity in [[harness racing]], a rolling start was used. The horses were driven in a number of circles, and the manoeuvre, if carried out correctly, arranged the horses in lines. The fairness of the start was judged by stewards at the starting line; if they judged that a racer was not fairly in line with the others, a false start would be called and the race would start again. This process was sometimes repeated several times before a fair start occurred. In the middle 20th Century, the mobile starting gate was developed.\n\nMost harness races now start from behind a motorized starting gate, called a \"car start\" or \"auto start\".  This device consists of a car or pickup truck equipped with a hinged gate that resembles metal \"wings\" on each side of the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven down the center of the track, the wings are extended and the horses line up in order behind it. When the gate reaches the starting line, the starter retracts the wings, which fold inward toward the vehicle body. The vehicle then accelerates away from the horses and pulls off to the outside to let the racers proceed; it many cases, it then follows close behind the racers for officials to view the race and any potential infractions of rules.  The modern starting gate uses a driver for steering the vehicle while the starter sits in the rear to concentrate on the actual horses positioning during the \"score up\".   The starter will also observe the race and call a false start if required.\n\nThe motorized gate drastically reduced the number of false starts, but did not eliminate them. If the starter, who rides in the vehicle facing backward toward the horses, sees that the start is not fair in some way, he may issue a recall and order the race to be started again.  Today, the start speed, acceleration, score up distance, and gate closing are controlled via a computer system, which takes control of the vehicle and provides a printout at the end of the score up.\n\nThe other kind of start to race is a standing start, where there are tapes across the track and the horses stand [[wikt:stationary|stationary]] behind the tapes before the start. This enables [[Handicapping|handicaps]] to be placed on horses according to class. Some [[Europe]]an, [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] races start using tapes.\n\n==Dog racing==\nGreyhound racing uses a device similar in nature and concept to the horse racing starting gate. The machine is usually called a '''starting box,''' owing to its use of boxes to hold the greyhounds in place. Dogs are loaded from the rear, with a small window in the front door through which the dog can see the track and the mechanical lure.\n\nOnce the lure has come around to a point a few meters behind the box, it passes a sensor which trips a switch to release the gates which swing upward to open, releasing the dogs. The opening gates start the race clock. Unlike horse racing, this action does not signal the totalizator system to end betting; that is done instead by a steward just before the lure is sent on its way.\n\nStarting boxes normally hold eight dogs, with some holding nine.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hysplex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://mobilestartinggates.spaces.live.com/default.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0 Gallery of harness racing mobile starting gates]\n*[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136286/index.htm Sports Illustrated, The Man Who Gave Racing a Fresh Start]\n\n[[Category:Horse racing]]\n[[Category:Greyhound racing]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Hastings starting gate.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Racecourse]]'s starting gate, 2009.]]\n[[File:Belmont Stakes 2014 start 03.png|thumb|Start of the Belmont Stakes 2014]]\n[[File:2009 Hong Kong Derby.JPG|thumb|Horses leaving barrier stalls at the start of a [[Hong Kong Derby]].]]\n\nA '''starting gate''' also called a '''starting barrier''' or '''starting stalls''' is a machine used to ensure a fair start to in [[horse racing]] and [[dog racing]].\n\n== History ==\nThroughout the history of [[horse racing]], there have been proposals as to how better to start a race. A commonly used starting system for horse races was devised in the mid nineteenth century by [[Henry John Rous|Admiral Rous]], a steward of the [[Jockey Club]] and public [[Handicapping|handicapper]].  A starter, standing alongside the jockeys and horses, dropped his flag to signal the start. An assistant some 100 yards down the course raised a second flag to indicate false starts.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\">{{cite book | last = Peake | first = Wayne | title = Unregistered proprietary horse racing in Sydney 1888-1942 | year = 2004 | access-date = 2006-04-17 | publisher = Australian Digital Theses Program (University of Western Sydney) | pages = 141\u2013184 | chapter = Chapter 4: Programming and conducting unregistered proprietary horse racing | chapterurl = http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/uploads/approved/adt-NUWS20050817.163106/public/06Chapter4.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060906160608/http://library.uws.edu.au/adt-NUWS/uploads/approved/adt-NUWS20050817.163106/public/06Chapter4.pdf | archive-date = 2006-09-06 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nAn official starter might be well paid, but his duties were very demanding. Early in the twentieth century, he was supported by perhaps a single assistant who primed the spring-barrier, as well as the clerk of the course.  In the present day there are many attendants to steady runners from super-structured barrier stalls.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/>\n\n[[Image:Horseracestart1952.jpg|thumb|A strand barrier start of a horse race in [[South Australia]] in 1952]]\nThe first horse racing starting barriers were simple ropes or occasionally wooden barriers behind which the horses stood.  The first automated design was pioneered in [[Australia]] and was first used at an official race meeting in 1894.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.nma.gov.au/about_us/nma_corporate_documents/annual_report/03_04/part_5/appendix_3_acquisitions_-_national_historical_collection_page_3_of_3 | title = National Museum of Australia: Annual Report 2003-2004 Part 5 - Appendices; Appendix 3, Acquisitions - National Historical Collection (page 3 of 3) | publisher = National Museum of Australia | accessdate = 2011-01-05}}</ref>  Alexander Gray had concluded that the flapping of a starter's flag distracted the horses.  An impetus for his invention was a \u00a35 fine received by his son, Reuben, a jockey, for allowing his mount to step over the white chalk line that marked the start.  His machine was first tried out at [[City of Canterbury, New South Wales#Attractions|Canterbury Park Racecourse in New South Wales]] in February 1894.  Gray's prototype consisted of a single strand of wire at about the height of the horse\u2019s head that was attached to a spring at either end. When the device was activated the barrier sprang up and away from the horses.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/>  Gray's single-strand barrier was among those first used. Versions of barriers designed by Alexander and Reuben Gray were installed at race tracks in Australia and overseas between 1894 and about 1932. By the 1920s the single strand barrier had evolved into a spring-powered five-strand device designed by Johnstone and Gleeson, but based on Gray's prototype, that resembled a strongman\u2019s chest expander.<ref name=\"PeakeChap4\"/> Barriers assured fair starts to races. Fair race starts encouraged owners to enter horses in races and punters to bet, and they contributed to changing horse racing from a social sporting event into a billion dollar industry.\n\nThe inventor of the electric starting gate for horse racing is [[Clay Puett]], who was a rider and starter at various tracks in the American West. Puett's device replaced other starting methods which often failed to produce a fair start, with extra judges employed to catch horses who got a jump on the rest of the field.\n\nA transportable starting machine was imported from the [[United States]] to Australia in 1946. It wasn't until 1965 that starting stalls were introduced by the [[Jockey Club]] to [[horseracing in the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news  | first=Greg  | last=Wood  | author=  | url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/horseracing/story/0,,1745459,00.html  | title=End of an era as Jockey Club falls on own sword  | work=  | publisher=[[The Guardian]]  | pages=  | page=  | date=April 3, 2006  | accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>\n\n10 years ago a European manufacturer ( [[https://fornells.com]] ) designed a new kind of starting gates. When the starting gates developed in USA are considered very robust it is obvious that the size and weight of this kind of starting gates are very heavy and very long. It is not adapted for many [[turf tracks]]. \" we are supplying racetrack for more than 40 years and we have been asked constantly by the racecourses if we could design a new starting gates adapted to wet weather and turf tracks where rails needs to be moved. 1O years ago we finally had our first starting gates manufactured and supplied to answer it \" said David Maizeret, Fornells' CEO. The cost of the maintenance of the turf tracks and the changing in the [[horse racing industry]] revenues encourage racecourse management to investigate for new solutions. The international authorities in Ireland [[HRI]]<ref>{{cite web | year = 2019 | url = https://www.theirishfield.ie/news-hri-continues-to-invest-in-starting-stalls-462178/}}</ref>, [[FranceFrance galop]], Morocco [[SOREC]] or Saudi arabia [[The Equestrian club of Riyadh]] for instance have now adopted this new generation of starting gates. They was looking for a best economical solution, safe for the horses and jockeys, light to keep the track in good shape and very quiet. But over all, the horse racing industry is now looking for a safe start as the betting is a key point. The new generation answer to this needs. \" Fornells' opening system has been developed to guarantee the most efficient start with easy maintenance and maximum reliability \" says Georges Indrian Jafy, Doctor in sciences and director of Fornells' design office. The improvements to be made and the new developments to come are going to be faster in the coming years in an industry who is in his most important changing period of his history.\n\n==Flat horse racing==\n[[File:Sun Downs starting gate.JPG|thumb|Starting gate detail, looking in from front to back]]\nMany of Puett's actual gates are still in use today at tracks around the world, and all gates are based on his original design. A starting gate is equipped with a number of stalls aligned in a row, usually numbering 12 or 14 for everyday use at tracks. Smaller gates may be used at training facilities for schooling horses, or as an auxiliary gate in addition to the main gate for large-field races such as the [[Kentucky Derby]].\n\nThe gates are suspended from an overhead welded steel [[truss]], supported at each end by wheels with pneumatic tires.  The entire structure is designed to be towed behind a tractor or truck, so that it can be moved about on the racetrack grounds, or towed over highways from place to place.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', {{US patent|6637094}}.</ref>\n\nHorses normally enter from the rear of the stall, with gates locked behind the horse once it is in place; the front gates of the stall are normally closed as the horse is loaded in, though the starting-gate crew may open it in order to entice a horse who balks at entry. Alternately, a horse may be backed into the stall from the front entry, again done in the case of a skittish horse.\n[[File:WoodbineStartGate.jpg|thumb|left|A Woodbine Racetrack starting gate, backside.]]\n\nThe front door of each stall is held closed by an electromagnetic lock. The stall doors are designed to give way in case a horse prematurely attempts to bolt through the front or back, in order to reduce or prevent injury to horse or rider.\n\nWhen the starter is satisfied that all horses are in place and ready to start the race, he presses a button, cutting the electric current, simultaneously opening the front stall doors, ringing a loud bell, and sending a signal to the [[Tote board|totalizator]] system that the race is begun and no more bets should be accepted.\n\nPuett's gate was first used at [[Hastings Racecourse|Exhibition Park]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] in 1939, though the management of [[Bay Meadows Racetrack]] in [[San Mateo, California]] claims that their track was the first to use Puett's gate.<ref>[http://www.baymeadows.com/vuhistory.php?active_main=0%26active_sub=1 BayMeadows.com: Bay Meadows history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404020520/http://www.baymeadows.com/vuhistory.php?active_main=0%26active_sub=1 |date=2008-04-04 }}, accessed 2008-06-06]</ref> By the end of 1940, virtually all major race tracks in the United States used Puett gates.

The only visible sign remaining of this are the ruins of the [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] built in the 10th Century. However, an archaeological survey in 2001 found traces of monastic buildings beneath the road. These were a chapel and three support buildings which were constructed from wood, had thatched roofs and wall made of clay or wattle. This site was on either side of the road and centred around Killoughternane Cross. The survey also found indications that before the building of the now ruined oratory it was the site of an earlier 8th century timber-framed church which wasthe same length as the ruined oratory but was considerably wider. They also discovered a Neolithic burial beneath the oratory. The survey found that there was as many as 25 buildings on the site at Killoughternane.<ref name = igp>{{cite web |url = http://www.igp-web.com/Carlow/St_Fortiarnans_church.htm | title = St Fortiarnans Church | accessdate = 27 March 2020 | publisher = Irish Genealogy Projects}}</ref>  \n\nThe monastery had a round tower which was located to the north west of the Oratory's eastern wall at a distance of about 20 yards, it had a height of {{convert|96|ft|m}} and was destroyed in the 13th century after it was struck by lightning.

The monastery became a site noted for its learning for a millennium after its founding. The only visible sign remaining of this are the ruins of the [[oratory]] built in the 10th Century. However, an archaeological survey in 2001 found traces of monastic buildings beneath the road. These were a chapel and three support buildings which were constructed from wood, had thatched roofs and wall made of clay or wattle. This site was on either side of the road and centred around Killoughternane Cross. The survey also found indications that before the building of the now ruined oratory it was the site of an earlier 8th century timber-framed church which wasthe same length as the ruined oratory but was considerably wider. They also discovered a Neolithic burial beneath the oratory. The survey found that there was as many as 25 buildings on the site at Killoughternane.<ref name = igp>{{cite web |url = http://www.igp-web.com/Carlow/St_Fortiarnans_church.htm | title = St Fortiarnans Church | accessdate = 27 March 2020 | publisher = Irish Genealogy Projects}}</ref>  \n\nThe monastery had a round tower which was located to the north west of the Oratory's eastern wall at a distance of about 20 yards, it had a height of {{convert|96|ft|m}} and was destroyed in the 13th century after it was struck by lightning. The monsatery was expanded in the middle ages when a large church was built of stone with a wood shingle roof was contructed along with an infirmary, a dormitory and classrooms. In the 14th Centurt the final buildings were added, again of stone, and these were a lecture hall, a washroom and a residence.<ref name = igp/>\n\n==The building==\nThe church is made of local hammer-dressed [[granite]], with walls 80&nbsp;cm (2\u2154 ft) thick.

He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344. A variant on his Middle Dutch name is \"Jeroen\". Van Dijck points out that in all contemporary sources the name \"Jeroen\" is used twice, while the name \"Joen\" is used nine times, making \"Joen\" to be his probable Christian name.</ref> respectively the Latin and [[Middle Dutch]] form of the name \"Jerome\") van Aken (meaning \"from [[Aachen]]\"). He signed a number of his paintings as ''Jheronimus Bosch''.<ref>Signed works by Bosch include ''[[The Epiphany (Bosch)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[Saint Christopher Carrying the Christ Child]]'', ''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'', ''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'', ''[[The Hermit Saint|The Hermit Saints Triptych]]'', and ''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]''.</ref> The name derives from his birthplace, {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, which is commonly called \"Den Bosch\" ('the forest').{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life or training. He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed. He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often received commissions from abroad.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1488 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, a devotional confraternity of some forty influential citizens of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and seven thousand 'outer-members' from around Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSometime between 1479 and 1481, Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen, who was a few years his senior. The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where his wife had inherited a house and land from her wealthy family.<ref>Valery, Paul. ''The Phase of Doubt, A Critical Reflection''.</ref> An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch's death in 1516.

According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven attributed to his middle period.<ref>Stefan Fischer. ''Bosch: The Complete Works.''</ref> Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. Indeed, he taught pupils in the workshop, who were influenced by him. The recent [[dendrochronological]] investigation of the oak panels by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project<ref>[http://boschproject.org/ Bosch Research and Conservation Project], 2016</ref> led to a more precise dating of the majority of Bosch's paintings.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Luuk Hoogstede|author2=Ron Spronk|author3=Matthijs Ilsink| author4=Robert G.

About twenty-five paintings remain today that can be attributed to him. In the late 16th century, [[Philip II of Spain]] acquired many of Bosch's paintings; as a result, the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]] now owns ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Bosch, Madrid)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', the tabletop painting of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' and ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Painting materials===\nBosch painted his works mostly on oak panels using oil as a medium. Bosch's palette was rather limited and contained the usual pigments of his time.<ref>Hoogstede et al.

It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his.

He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344.

He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed.

It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as [[infrared|infrared reflectography]], which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing.<ref>Finaldi, Gabriele/ Garrido, Carmen \"El trazo oculto.

In this case, pallets of the products on offer are simply parked alongside the aisles, and customers picking up products will gradually empty them. When all items on a pallet have been sold, they are replaced. Prices are given on plain labels.\n*[[Queueing]] at the [[checkout lane|checkout]] is relatively common, as staffing levels reflect average demand rather than peak demand. At actual peak times, customers often have to wait.\n*[[Shopping bag]]s are charged for, as they are seen as a frill. Thus many shoppers bring [[reusable shopping bag]]s, buy shopping bags at a low fee, put their shopping in the [[cardboard box]]es that the products originally came in, or put it directly in their [[shopping cart]]; customers must bag their own purchases. \n*They somewhat employ the [[Pareto principle]] when choosing which goods to offer, meaning that in most supermarkets, 20% of products on sale account for 80% of what customers buy. Therefore, they only stock the most commonly sold products.\n*They only take cash and [[debit card]]s (although this has changed in many chains over the years due to increasingly prevalence and usage of credit cards).\n*They only open at peak times, e.g., 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, although some stores are open 24 hours.\n*They often do not sell branded items, except in the case of special purchases, which are almost always at a discounted price. Instead, they sell [[Generic brand|generic]] or [[private label]] products.\n* Products are sold in one size, which is usually the best selling size of that product, rather than multiple different sizes of the product.\n*The [[shopping cart]]s have a coin-operated slot, to ensure that the trolleys are kept on site.\n*They usually lack a [[butcher shop]], [[bakery]] or [[Delicatessen|deli]] counters, thus  [[meat]], and [[cold meats]] are sold precut in chilled vacuum packs.\n*Unlike regular supermarkets which have separate teams of staff for the shop floor, the back warehouse, doing the cleaning and dealing with the clerical work. No frills supermarkets instead have a single multi-tasking team of workers dealing with all aspects of supermarket work.\n*No in-store background music, although some use [[satellite radio]].\n\nExamples of no-frills [[supermarket chain]]s include:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Aldi]]''' ([[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]], and [[United Kingdom]])\n*'''[[Biedronka]]''', a subsidiary of [[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]] (Poland)\n*'''[[B\u00f3nus]]''' ([[Iceland]])\n*'''[[Colruyt]]''' ([[Belgium]], France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]])\n*'''[[Denner (supermarkets)|Denner]]''' ([[Switzerland]]) used to be a no-frills retailer, but has started polishing its image.\n*'''[[Dia (supermarket chain)|Dia]]*''' ([[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Argentina]], Portugal)\n*'''[[Ed (supermarket)|Ed]]*''' (France)\n*'''[[Food Basics USA|Food Basics]]''', a subsidiary of [[The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company|A&P]] (United States)\n*'''[[Food Basics]]''', a subsidiary of [[Metro Inc.]] ([[Canada]])\n*'''[[FreshCo]]''', a subsidiary of [[Sobeys]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Jack's (supermarket)|Jack's]]''', a subsidiary of [[Tesco]] ([[England]], [[United Kingdom]])\n*'''[[Leader Price]]''' ([[France]])\n*'''[[Lidl]]''' (Austria, Belgium, [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, [[Italy]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Netherlands]], Poland, Portugal, [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]])\n*'''[[Maxi (Canadian supermarket)|Maxi]]''', a subsidiary of [[Loblaw Companies]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Minipre\u00e7o]]*''' (Portugal)\n*'''[[Netto (store)|Netto]]''' (Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Poland, [[Lanzarote]])\n*'''[[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]]''', a subsidiary of [[Loblaw Companies]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Pak'n Save]]''' ([[New Zealand]])\n*'''[[Poundland]]''' (United Kingdom)\n*'''[[Poundworld]]''' (United Kingdom)\n*'''[[REMA 1000]]''' ([[Norway]], Denmark, Sweden, Slovakia)\n*'''[[Save-A-Lot]]''' (United States)\n*'''[[Super C (supermarket)|Super C]]''', a division of [[Metro Inc.]] based in Qu\u00e9bec\n*'''[[WinCo Foods]]''' (United States)\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dia, Minipre\u00e7o and Ed are all part of the [[Dia (supermarket chain)|Dia]] Group, which is in turn part of the [[Carrefour]] Group.

Often, the less-expensive models are sold with a [[manual transmission]] and have a shorter options list. Early 1950s American examples include the [[Chevrolet 150]] and [[Kaiser-Frazer]] [[Henry J]]. These were larger cars than those produced in the US in the 1940s gasoline rationing period by [[Crosley]], who shut down in 1952.\n\nOne of the more famous no-frills cars was the [[Studebaker Scotsman]], which was on sale from 1957 to 1958. These cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and contained only a driver's side sunvisor, minimal soundproofing, no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim); even routine convenience items, such as a [[Cigarette lighter receptacle|cigarette lighter]] and [[dome light]] were deleted. Buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost [[heater]] and a few other trim and convenience items from a short options list; a [[radio]] was not offered as an option on this model (unlike [[Studebaker|Studebaker's]] more expensive models).\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, American automakers offered several trim levels of full-sized models (each having a different name), with a price-leading no-frills versions. Examples included the [[Chevrolet Biscayne]], [[Ford Custom 500]], and [[Plymouth Fury|Plymouth Fury I]]. While ostensibly targeted toward fleet buyers and business customers where luxury is not a concern, these cars were also available to private customers. While many of these cars were typically sold with the standard six-cylinder or basic V-8 engine with the standard three-speed manual transmission, many of these price-leading models were also available with the full range of engines and transmissions, including those that were performance-oriented, unlike the later no-frills models that had restricted performance options.<ref name=\"marketing_concepts\"/> Additionally, marketing brochures typically extolled the virtues of these economy models, pointing out such features as durable and easy-to-care for upholstery with wide color availability, beauty in styling despite minimal exterior trim adornment, and features shared with more luxurious models such as suspension and ride quality, engine and transmission availability, and standard safety and convenience features\u2014all available even for budget-conscious buyers.<ref>\"Biscayne: Thrifiest to buy of all big Chevrolets,\" 1962 Chevrolet brochure, pages 10-11. [http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chevrolet/1962_Chevrolet/1962_Chevrolet_Full_Size_Brochure/1962-Chevrolet-Full-Size-10-11]</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, a vast majority of all price-leading models were built and sold with V-8 engines and automatic transmission, as consumer needs were changing, and were even being built and sold with luxury comfort and convenience features once seen only on the higher-priced model lines, including air conditioning and power steering. Only a small handful of base model vehicles were sold with the basic six-cylinder/three-speed manual transmission power team and stripped of all options by this time, and by the early 1970s, Plymouth, Ford and Chevrolet had switched to all V-8 engine/automatic transmission power teams for the full-sized model lines. With customers turning more to volume models that were better trimmed, upholstered and equipped (even with price a primary consideration), the Big Three dropped their Spartan-trimmed price-leading models, such as the Chevrolet Biscayne and Ford Custom, or relegated them completely to fleet sales with no private buyer availability.\n\nDuring the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, many American automakers began offering no-frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the [[Ford Pinto|Ford Pinto MPG]], and [[Plymouth Duster|Plymouth Duster \"Feather Duster\"]]). As before, these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering); fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (e.g., no cigarette lighter); lighter-weight components (such as [[aluminum]] on various engine, body and suspension components); and a manual transmission.\n\n[[Image:Tata Nano im Verkehrszentrum des Deutschen Museums.JPG|250px|thumb|The no-frills [[Tata Nano]]]]\n[[Image:DaciaLogan.jpg|250px|thumb|The no-frills 2004 Dacia Logan]]\nMost no-frills cars are sold to fleet buyers, such as taxi companies or police departments. However, these models are generally available to cost-conscious private customers whose primary concerns were price, fuel economy and basic low-cost transportation.<ref name=\"marketing_concepts\"/>\n\nThe concept of a no-frills car in the European market was common in the 1950s with cars such as the [[Ford Vedette|Ford Abeille]] or the [[Citro\u00ebn DS|Citro\u00ebn ID Normale]]. The [[Dacia Logan]] is an example of a recent no-frills car in Europe.

In this case, pallets of the products on offer are simply parked alongside the aisles, and customers picking up products will gradually empty them. When all items on a pallet have been sold, they are replaced. Prices are given on plain labels.\n*[[Queueing]] at the [[checkout lane|checkout]] is relatively common, as staffing levels reflect average demand rather than peak demand. At actual peak times, customers often have to wait.\n*[[Shopping bag]]s are charged for, as they are seen as a frill. Thus many shoppers bring [[reusable shopping bag]]s, buy shopping bags at a low fee, put their shopping in the [[cardboard box]]es that the products originally came in, or put it directly in their [[shopping cart]]; customers must bag their own purchases. \n*They somewhat employ the [[Pareto principle]] when choosing which goods to offer, meaning that in most supermarkets, 20% of products on sale account for 80% of what customers buy. Therefore, they only stock the most commonly sold products.\n*They only take cash and [[debit card]]s (although this has changed in many chains over the years due to increasingly prevalence and usage of credit cards).\n*They only open at peak times, e.g., 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, although some stores are open 24 hours.\n*They often do not sell branded items, except in the case of special purchases, which are almost always at a discounted price. Instead, they sell [[Generic brand|generic]] or [[private label]] products.\n* Products are sold in one size, which is usually the best selling size of that product, rather than multiple different sizes of the product.\n*The [[shopping cart]]s have a coin-operated slot, to ensure that the trolleys are kept on site.\n*They usually lack a [[butcher shop]], [[bakery]] or [[Delicatessen|deli]] counters, thus  [[meat]], and [[cold meats]] are sold precut in chilled vacuum packs.\n*Unlike regular supermarkets which have separate teams of staff for the shop floor, the back warehouse, doing the cleaning and dealing with the clerical work. No frills supermarkets instead have a single multi-tasking team of workers dealing with all aspects of supermarket work.\n*No in-store background music, although some use [[satellite radio]].\n\nExamples of no-frills [[supermarket chain]]s include:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Aldi]]''' ([[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]], and [[United Kingdom]])\n*'''[[Biedronka]]''', a subsidiary of [[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]] (Poland)\n*'''[[B\u00f3nus]]''' ([[Iceland]])\n*'''[[Colruyt]]''' ([[Belgium]], France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]])\n*'''[[Denner (supermarkets)|Denner]]''' ([[Switzerland]]) used to be a no-frills retailer, but has started polishing its image.\n*'''[[Dia (supermarket chain)|Dia]]*''' ([[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Argentina]], Portugal)\n*'''[[Ed (supermarket)|Ed]]*''' (France)\n*'''[[Food Basics USA|Food Basics]]''', a subsidiary of [[The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company|A&P]] (United States)\n*'''[[Food Basics]]''', a subsidiary of [[Metro Inc.]] ([[Canada]])\n*'''[[FreshCo]]''', a subsidiary of [[Sobeys]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Jack's (supermarket)|Jack's]]''', a subsidiary of [[Tesco]] ([[England]], [[United Kingdom]])\n*'''[[Leader Price]]''' ([[France]])\n*'''[[Lidl]]''' (Austria, Belgium, [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, [[Italy]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Netherlands]], Poland, Portugal, [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]])\n*'''[[Maxi (Canadian supermarket)|Maxi]]''', a subsidiary of [[Loblaw Companies]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Minipre\u00e7o]]*''' (Portugal)\n*'''[[Netto (store)|Netto]]''' (Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Poland, [[Lanzarote]])\n*'''[[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]]''', a subsidiary of [[Loblaw Companies]] (Canada)\n*'''[[Pak'n Save]]''' ([[New Zealand]])\n*'''[[Poundland]]''' (United Kingdom)\n*'''[[Poundworld]]''' (United Kingdom)\n*'''[[REMA 1000]]''' ([[Norway]], Denmark, Sweden, Slovakia)\n*'''[[Save-A-Lot]]''' (United States)\n*'''[[Super C (supermarket)|Super C]]''', a division of [[Metro Inc.]] based in Qu\u00e9bec\n*'''[[WinCo Foods]]''' (United States)\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Dia, Minipre\u00e7o and Ed are all part of the [[Dia (supermarket chain)|Dia]] Group, which is in turn part of the [[Carrefour]] Group.

Often, the less-expensive models are sold with a [[manual transmission]] and have a shorter options list. Early 1950s American examples include the [[Chevrolet 150]] and [[Kaiser-Frazer]] [[Henry J]]. These were larger cars than those produced in the US in the 1940s gasoline rationing period by [[Crosley]], who shut down in 1952.\n\nOne of the more famous no-frills cars was the [[Studebaker Scotsman]], which was on sale from 1957 to 1958. These cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and contained only a driver's side sunvisor, minimal soundproofing, no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim); even routine convenience items, such as a [[Cigarette lighter receptacle|cigarette lighter]] and [[dome light]] were deleted. Buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost [[heater]] and a few other trim and convenience items from a short options list; a [[radio]] was not offered as an option on this model (unlike [[Studebaker|Studebaker's]] more expensive models).\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, American automakers offered several trim levels of full-sized models (each having a different name), with a price-leading no-frills versions. Examples included the [[Chevrolet Biscayne]], [[Ford Custom 500]], and [[Plymouth Fury|Plymouth Fury I]]. While ostensibly targeted toward fleet buyers and business customers where luxury is not a concern, these cars were also available to private customers. While many of these cars were typically sold with the standard six-cylinder or basic V-8 engine with the standard three-speed manual transmission, many of these price-leading models were also available with the full range of engines and transmissions, including those that were performance-oriented, unlike the later no-frills models that had restricted performance options.<ref name=\"marketing_concepts\"/> Additionally, marketing brochures typically extolled the virtues of these economy models, pointing out such features as durable and easy-to-care for upholstery with wide color availability, beauty in styling despite minimal exterior trim adornment, and features shared with more luxurious models such as suspension and ride quality, engine and transmission availability, and standard safety and convenience features\u2014all available even for budget-conscious buyers.<ref>\"Biscayne: Thrifiest to buy of all big Chevrolets,\" 1962 Chevrolet brochure, pages 10-11. [http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chevrolet/1962_Chevrolet/1962_Chevrolet_Full_Size_Brochure/1962-Chevrolet-Full-Size-10-11]</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, a vast majority of all price-leading models were built and sold with V-8 engines and automatic transmission, as consumer needs were changing, and were even being built and sold with luxury comfort and convenience features once seen only on the higher-priced model lines, including air conditioning and power steering. Only a small handful of base model vehicles were sold with the basic six-cylinder/three-speed manual transmission power team and stripped of all options by this time, and by the early 1970s, Plymouth, Ford and Chevrolet had switched to all V-8 engine/automatic transmission power teams for the full-sized model lines. With customers turning more to volume models that were better trimmed, upholstered and equipped (even with price a primary consideration), the Big Three dropped their Spartan-trimmed price-leading models, such as the Chevrolet Biscayne and Ford Custom, or relegated them completely to fleet sales with no private buyer availability.\n\nDuring the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, many American automakers began offering no-frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the [[Ford Pinto|Ford Pinto MPG]], and [[Plymouth Duster|Plymouth Duster \"Feather Duster\"]]). As before, these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering); fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (e.g., no cigarette lighter); lighter-weight components (such as [[aluminum]] on various engine, body and suspension components); and a manual transmission.\n\n[[Image:Tata Nano im Verkehrszentrum des Deutschen Museums.JPG|250px|thumb|The no-frills [[Tata Nano]]]]\n[[Image:DaciaLogan.jpg|250px|thumb|The no-frills 2004 Dacia Logan]]\nMost no-frills cars are sold to fleet buyers, such as taxi companies or police departments. However, these models are generally available to cost-conscious private customers whose primary concerns were price, fuel economy and basic low-cost transportation.<ref name=\"marketing_concepts\"/>\n\nThe concept of a no-frills car in the European market was common in the 1950s with cars such as the [[Ford Vedette|Ford Abeille]] or the [[Citro\u00ebn DS|Citro\u00ebn ID Normale]]. The [[Dacia Logan]] is an example of a recent no-frills car in Europe. Another example is [[Fiat Albea]].\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the no-frills category takes a considerable share of the new car market.

Some like Tune and easyHotel even go as far as putting advertisements on the walls and in case of Zip some rooms even having no windows, instead having a sunlight-powered [[Light therapy|light box]].\n\nLike no frills airlines which charge people for seat reservations and food, no frills hotels themselves charge extra for any superfluous extras like non-basic TV channels, breakfasts; which themselves  are just limited to a [[Breakfast|continental style]], tea-and-coffee making facilities, [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi internet]] , daily [[Housekeeping|maid service]]; normally cleaning the room is only done when the guest leaves, and toiletries & supplement towels.\n\n== No-frills holiday ==\nNo-frills holidays are holidays which, like no-frills airlines, do not include unnecessary services such as: \n*[[in-flight meal]]s\n*travel [[Union steward|representatives]]\n*transfers between the airport and the hotel\n*entertainment\n*luxury accommodation\nSuch holidays usually have a simple fare scheme, in which fares typically increase during peak seasons, and also as more people sign up for the holiday. This rewards early reservations, and is known as \"[[yield management]]\".\n\nExamples of no-frills holiday companies are:\n* Just, part of the Thomson/[[TUI AG|TUI]] group\n* Qbic Low Cost Design Hotels\n\n== No-frills gyms ==\n\nCompared from regular fitness gyms, there has been a growing number of no frills gyms. No frills gyms are noted from regular gyms. These differ in noted ways include:\n\n* No [[Receptionist|reception]]: everything like registration and booking classes is done online.\n* No fitness classes, or fitness classes are available at a supplementary cost on top of regular monthly membership fees. \n* No [[swimming pool]], [[hot tub]], [[sauna]], [[tanning bed|solarium]] or beauty spa, due to the cost of running such facilities, e.g., needing to have a staff member there at all times and frequent cleaning.\n* No caf\u00e9 or relaxation room, drinks and snacks are available through vending machines. \n* Most of the fitness machines are self-powered, rather than electrically powered thus cutting down of power costs and running costs.\n\nExamples of no frills gyms are easyGym, [[Energie Group|Fit4less]] and [[PureGym]] in the UK, Basic-Fit in Benelux and France, and McFit in Germany.\n\n== No frills filling stations ==\n[[File:Tinq Delfgauw.jpg|thumb|An example of a no frills petrol station, this one is a TinQ in the Netherlands.|alt=|275x275px]]\nIn [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and other European countries, you can find no frills [[filling station]]s. These are petrol stations that consist of a series of [[Pay at the pump|self-service]] [[Gasoline|petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] [[fuel dispenser]]s that you pay with a [[Payment card|bank card]]. There are no other facilities on-site like [[kiosk]]s, [[toilet]]s, [[car wash]]es or water & [[Pump|air pumps]], plus many don't have [[loyalty program]]mes. If there is a problem, drivers are to call a [[hotline]] using a on-site telephone where the station owners will be alerted to the site, and if needs be cut the fuel to the pumps.

Other gods fled the battlefield unable to sustain his power.\n\n==Origin==\n\nWithin [[Shaivism]], the myth of Virabhadra's origins runs as follows. Sati was the youngest daughter of [[Daksha]]. While growing up, she set her heart on Shiva and worshipped him. In the [[Swayamvara]] of Sati, Daksha invited all the devas and princes except Shiva. Sati cast her garland into air, calling upon Shiva to receive it, and behold he stood in the midst of the court with the garland about his neck. Daksha had no choice but to get his daughter married to Shiva.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Sister Nivedita]] & [[Ananda K. Coomaraswamy]]: Myths and Legends of the Hindus and Buddhists, Kolkata, 2001 {{ISBN|81-7505-197-3}}</ref>\n\nOne day, Daksha invited all the devas in order to perform a great offering called the Ashwamedha yagna, omitting only Shiva. Sati's urge to attend the event, due to her affection towards her parents, overpowered the social etiquette of not going to an uninvited ceremony; thus, Daksha insulted her in front of his guests. Angered after hearing insults against her husband, she set herself ablaze by her inner yog\u0101gni. The site where Sati had died later on became known as \"Jwalamukhi devi\".<ref>From [[Purana|Puran]] sati khand in part two of Rudra Samhita\"</ref>\n\nWhen Shiva came to know about what had happened, with deep sorrow and anger, he plucked a lock from his hair and thrashed it on the ground. Both Veerabhadra and Bhadrakali were born from it. The former is believed to be the destroyer of Agnana: born with a tall, muscular body reaching the higher heavens, he was as dark as the stormy clouds, with three burning eyes and fiery hair. He also wore a [[Mundamala|garland of skulls]] and carried weapons. To provide him the power, arrived [[Bhadrakali]], a wrathful incarnation of [[Devi]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Destroyer of Daksha==\n[[File:Veerabhadra.jpg|thumb|A statue in [[Dharmapuri district]] depicting Veerabhadra]]\n\n{{quote|Maheshwara replied, 'Spoil the sacrifice of Daksha'.

She too in her wrath, as the fearful goddess Rudrakali, accompanied him, with all her train, to witness his deeds.|[[Vayu Purana]]|<ref name=Vishnu/>}}\n\nThe myth of Virabhadra's life runs as follows. Shiva directed Virabhadra: \"Lead my army against Daksha and destroy his sacrifice\". On this direction of Shiva, Virabhadra appeared with Shiva's [[gana]]s in the midst of Daksha's assembly like a storm and broke the sacrificial vessels, polluted the offerings, insulted the [[Brahmin]] priests, trampled on [[Indra]], broke the staff of [[Yama]] and scattered the gods on every side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/SreeLalitopakhyanam/TXT/00000047.txt|title=Full text of \"Sree Lalitopakhyanam\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref> The Devas fled in all directions, the sages cried \"Hari, you're the protector of Daksha's Yagna. You solely are the performer as well as giver of fruits in the Yagna. Oh Lakshmi-Narayan! Help us\".\n\nVishnu heard those prayers and apparated out of the Yagna hall in the field. Virabhadra frowned on seeing him. His grip became more firm on his trident.\n\nVirabhadra said in a stiff voice \"Hari, how come you're the protector of this Yagna? Have you become Shiva's enemy? How can side with these men of wicked conduct?\".\n\nVishnu smiled and said \"Just as Shiva and Shiv\u0101, I am subservient to nothing but my devotees. And it's painful to say that Daksha is my devotee and he requested me initially to reside as the ultimate protector of this Yagna. I am bind by my words, as you are by your orders from Mahadeva\".\n\nVirabhadra gave a delightful expression. Lowering his head, he said \"Oh beloved of Shiva! I asked that just to confirm about your feelings. As is Shiva to me, so are you. How can I fight you?\".\n\nVishnu said \"Without any hesitation, fight with me. Defeated, I will go back to my abode\".\n\n[[File:Shree Kshetra Veerabhadra Devasthan,Vadhav 03.jpg|thumb|Shri Kshetra Virabhadra, Vadhav 03]]\n\nAnd saying so, Vishnu blew his Panchjanya [[Sacred conch|conch shell]] to begin the battle. He hurled his Sudarshan discus at the other ganas in the field who were fighting with the guardians of Yagna. Virabhadra saw this and started pacing towards him. By Vishnu's Maya, a thousand more beings, just like him in attire, issued out from his body for battling. Meanwhile, Mahakali, Katyayani, Chamunda, Ishani, Mundamalini and others were wreaking havoc in the field and producing alarming sounds.\n\nVirabhadra rotated on his spot and flung away the best of his weapons in all ten directions. Those weapons ripped apart the bodies of all those doppelgangers of Vishnu and turned them into ashes. Vishnu held his mace in his hands and was about to strike at Virabhadra when the latter hurled himself towards him and impaled his trident in his chest.\n\nVishnu fell down on the ground. Suddenly, there sprang a tornado of fire as fierce as the fire that consumes the three worlds at the time of Pralaya.\n\nVishnu stood up and his eyes were red with anger. The ground was trembling and the asteroids were hitting the earth.\nHe immediately rained powerful arrows at his foe from all directions. Angered all the more by this quite unexpected attack, Virabhadra also climbed a chariot and retaliated by sending fiery arrows in the direction of Vishnu. Thus started, they went on exchanging many a mighty astra and shastra as though two wild and mad elephants were at war; and the three worlds trembled with their movements; their mutual shouts of anger and wrath raised a thunderous din that filled the directions with rolling echoes. Both used celestial weapons - one upon the other; but none of them was affected in the least though they struck awe into the hearts of the onlookers and shook the three worlds. Both were equally matched and both were adept and quick with their hands and weapons in offensive and defensive. Keenly watching the fierce duel and thinking that Virabhadra might come out victorious, [[Brahma]] decided to become the charioteer of Virabhadra. Taking charge of the chariot instantly, he steered it ever so skillfully that Virabhadra, though angry at first, soon became reconciled and even appreciative on beholding the expert manner in which Brahma conducted the many intricate manoeuvres of the chariot. Continuing the duel, Virabhadra showered multiple weapons of tremendous power at Vishnu who retaliated with equal might. Thus proceeded a long-drawn-out battle between [[Hari]] and a manifestation of [[Shiva|Hara]], filling the three worlds with amazement; causing earth-quakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, landslides and storms and outbreaks of fire. The firmament reverberated with thunder and lightning. At last, discovering that it was impossible to subdue Virabhadra by any ordinary methods, Vishnu decided to take his life once and for all by using his invincible Discus-[[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudrasana]] - feared in all the worlds for its efficacy. So, twirling it around his right index finger, he let loose the mighty Sudarsana and it roared into the intervening space with such tremendous momentum and acceleration that it flew cleaving the air with incandescent jets of flame spouting off tangentially from its thousand revolving teeth.\n\nAs mentioned in Skanda Purana, Lord Vishnu threw Sudarshan Chakra on Virabhadra to kill him. Virabhadra tried to stop by stunning Hari by casting a spell upon him. The Sudarshan discus stopped spinning on his index finger as Vishnu became numb. He broke the spell and suddenly heard the victorious cries of Shiva ganas. He thought that it would be the perfect timing to get defeated and clear the pathway for Virabhadra.\n\nThinking so, he mounted an arrow upon his bow. Virabhadra immediately striked his arrows at his bow and broke his shaft. Thus, accepting the defeat, Vishnu hurriedly went away to Vaikuntha while Brahma went to his Satyaloka.\n\nSeeing the path cleared, Virabhadra smiled weirdly and announced his hordes to proceed to the chamber of Yagna. The body of Sati was fully burnt in the hall and had turned black now. Black smokes were fizzing out from her lifeless body. Daksha remained oblivious of this sight while his wife had just fainted when Sati had invoked the fire.\n\nVishnu said in a celestial voice to Brahma \"Today the curse of Dadhichi has turn out to be true. Due to an ancient fight, he cursed all of us, you, me and all Devas to be devoured in the fire of Rudra's anger. Now no one can save Daksha. And even the words of Sati have come true. She said all of us would suffer by siding with Daksha. No more she's Dakshayani. Now she's Daksha-Yagna-Vinaashini\".\n\n[[File:Veerabhadra,Jejuri.jpg|thumb|upright|Veerabhadra at Jejuri, Maharashtra.]]\n[[Image:Lepakshi2.jpg|thumb|Carved pillars of the Lepakshi temple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n{{Shaivism|state=collapsed}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Forms of Shiva]]\n[[Category:People in Hindu mythology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2006 film|Veerabhadra (film)}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{use Indian English|date=March 2016}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Faith primary|date=February 2017}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}\n}}\n{{Infobox deity\n| type        = Hindu\n| image       = File:Virabhadra silver plaque.jpg\n| caption     = Virabhadra devotional plaque<br>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/:File:Virabhadra_silver_plaque.jpg Notes]\n| name        = Veerabhadra\n| god_of      = destruction\n| affiliation = [[Vannar]] Aspect of [[Shiva]]\n| consort     = [[Bhadrakali]]\n}}\n{{Saivism}} \n[[File:Virabhadra Daksha.jpg|Virabhadra Daksha.jpg|thumb|Virabhadra and Daksha]]\n'''V\u012brabhadra''' ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0935\u0940\u0930\u092d\u0926\u094d\u0930, lit.

Thus, accepting the defeat, Vishnu hurriedly went away to Vaikuntha while Brahma went to his Satyaloka.\n\nSeeing the path cleared, Virabhadra smiled weirdly and announced his hordes to proceed to the chamber of Yagna. The body of Sati was fully burnt in the hall and had turned black now. Black smokes were fizzing out from her lifeless body. Daksha remained oblivious of this sight while his wife had just fainted when Sati had invoked the fire.\n\nVishnu said in a celestial voice to Brahma \"Today the curse of Dadhichi has turn out to be true. Due to an ancient fight, he cursed all of us, you, me and all Devas to be devoured in the fire of Rudra's anger. Now no one can save Daksha. And even the words of Sati have come true. She said all of us would suffer by siding with Daksha. No more she's Dakshayani. Now she's Daksha-Yagna-Vinaashini\".\n\n[[File:Veerabhadra,Jejuri.jpg|thumb|upright|Veerabhadra at Jejuri, Maharashtra.]]\n[[Image:Lepakshi2.jpg|thumb|Carved pillars of the Lepakshi temple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n{{Shaivism|state=collapsed}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Forms of Shiva]]\n[[Category:People in Hindu mythology]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDestroyer of Daksha:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Meanwhile \u2192 Meanwhile,, wrecking havoc \u2192 wreaking havoc", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virabhadra"}

The latter method involves the '''readcd''' binary, made specifically for this cause. The code that readcd executes in this instance is known as XeLL, short for '''Xenon Linux Loader'''. XeLL captures CPU threads and launches the Linux kernel from either network ([[Trivial File Transfer Protocol|tftp]]) or optical media as its only purpose, providing a flat device tree for the kernel.
