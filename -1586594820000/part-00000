{"title_page": "Independence of clones criterion", "text_new": "In [[voting system]]s theory, the '''independence of clones criterion''' measures an election method's robustness to [[strategic nomination]]. [[Nicolaus Tideman]] was the first to formulate this criterion, which states that the winner must not change due to the addition of a non-winning candidate who is similar to a candidate already present.<ref>T. Nicolaus Tideman, \"Independence of clones as a criterion for voting rules\", ''Social Choice and Welfare'' Vol. 4, No. 3 (1987), pp. 185&ndash;206.</ref>\n\nTo be more precise, a subset of the candidates, called a set of clones, exists if no voter ranks any candidate outside the set between (or equal to) any candidates that are in the set. If a set of clones contains at least two candidates, the criterion requires that deleting one of the clones must not increase or decrease the winning chance of any candidate not in the set of clones.\n\nIn some systems (such as the [[plurality vote]]), the addition of a similar candidate divides support between similar candidates, which can cause them both to lose. In some other systems (such as the [[Borda count]]), the addition of a similar alternative increases the apparent support for one of the similar candidates, which can cause it to win. In yet other systems (such as [[ranked pairs]]), the introduction of similar alternatives does not affect the chances of the dissimilar candidates, as required by the criterion. There are further systems where the effect of the additional similar alternatives depends on the distribution of other votes.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Clone negative and clone positive ==\nElection methods that fail independence of clones can be clone negative (the addition of a similar candidate decreases another candidate's chance of winning) or clone positive (the addition of a similar candidate increases another candidate's chance of winning). \n\nA method can also fail the independence of clones method in a way that's neither clone positive nor negative. This happens if the method changes its decision about the winner when a non-winning candidate is cloned, but the new winner is not the candidate that was cloned. The effect is called crowding.\n\nThe [[Borda count]] is an example of a clone positive method. [[Plurality voting]] is an example of a clone negative method because of [[vote-splitting]]. [[Copeland's method]] is an example of a method that exhibits crowding.\n\n== Compliant methods ==\n\n[[Instant-runoff voting]] and some election methods that comply with the [[Condorcet criterion]] such as [[ranked pairs]] and the [[Schulze method]]<ref>M. Schulze, \"A New Monotonic and Clone-Independent Single-Winner Election Method\", ''Voting Matters'' 17 (2003), pp 9&ndash;19.</ref> also meet independence of clones.\n\nThe interpretation of the term \"set of clones\" for scored voting systems is controversial. If clones are candidates that are considered nearly identical by the voters, [[range voting]] and [[majority judgment]] satisfy the criterion. If clones also include candidates that are still similar but clearly superior to an existing candidate, that superior clone can win in range voting, even if no inferior clone of that candidate would have won. However, since range voting and majority judgment satisfy the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion, the addition of clones never helps or harms candidates who are already present.\n\nSome of the other methods that fail the criterion are the [[Borda count]], [[Minimax Condorcet|minimax]], the [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]], [[Copeland's method]], [[Bucklin voting]], the [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]], and the [[two-round system]]. Variants of [[Instant-runoff voting]] that eliminate multiple candidates per round (e.g. the [[contingent vote]]) or forbid the voters from ranking all the candidates (e.g. the [[supplementary vote]]) also fail the criterion.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Borda count ===\n{{Main|Borda count}}\n\nConsider an election in which there are two candidates, A and B. Suppose the voters have the following preferences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B\n| 34%: B>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A would receive 66% Borda points (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d70) and B would receive 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). Thus candidate A would win by a 66% landslide.\n\nNow suppose supporters of B nominate an additional candidate, B<sub>2</sub>, that is very similar to B but considered inferior by all voters. For the 66% who prefer A, B continues to be their second choice. For the 34% who prefer B, A continues to be their least preferred candidate. Now the voters' preferences are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\n| 34%: B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A now has 132% Borda points (66%\u00d72 + 34%\u00d70). B has 134% (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d72). B<sub>2</sub> has 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). The nomination of B<sub>2</sub> changes the winner from A to B, overturning the landslide, even though the additional information about voters' preferences is redundant due to the similarity of B<sub>2</sub> to B.\n\nSimilar examples can be constructed to show that ''given the Borda count, any arbitrarily large landslide can be overturned by adding enough candidates'' (assuming at least one voter prefers the landslide loser). For example, to overturn a 90% landslide preference for A over B, add 9 alternatives similar/inferior to B. Then A's score would be 900% (90%\u00d710 + 10%\u00d70) and B's score would be 910% (90%\u00d79 + 10%\u00d710).\n\nNo knowledge of the voters' preferences is needed to exploit this strategy. Factions could simply nominate as many alternatives as possible that are similar to their preferred alternative.\n\nIn typical elections, game theory suggests this manipulability of Borda can be expected to be a serious problem, particularly when a significant number of voters can be expected to vote their sincere order of preference (as in public elections, where many voters are not strategically sophisticated; cite Michael R. Alvarez of Caltech). Small minorities typically have the power to nominate additional candidates, and typically it is easy to find additional candidates that are similar.\n\nIn the context of people running for office, people can take similar positions on the issues, and in the context of voting on proposals, it is easy to construct similar proposals. Game theory suggests that all factions would seek to nominate as many similar candidates as possible since the winner would depend on the number of similar candidates, regardless of the voters' preferences.\n\n=== Copeland ===\n{{Main|Copeland's method}}\nThis examples show that Copeland's method violates the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Crowding ====\nCopeland's method is vulnerable against crowding, that is the outcome of the election is changed by adding (non-winning) clones of a non-winning candidate. Assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 4 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C\n|-\n| 1           || B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C > A\n|-\n| 2           || C > A > B<sub>2</sub> > B > B<sub>3</sub>\n|}\nNote, that B, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> form a clone set.\n\n===== Clones not nominated =====\nIf only one of the clones would compete, preferences would be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > B > C\n|-\n| 1           || B > C > A\n|-\n| 2           || C > A > B\n|}\n\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\n{| class=wikitable border=1\n|+ Pairwise Preferences\n|-\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 | \n| colspan=3 bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" align=center | X\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | A\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | B\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | C\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" rowspan=3 | Y\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | A\n|\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | B\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n| \n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | C\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|\n|-\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | Pairwise election results (won-tied-lost):\n| 1-0-1\n| 0-1-1\n| 1-1-0\n|}\n\n* [X] indicates voters who preferred the candidate listed in the column caption to the candidate listed in the row caption\n* [Y] indicates voters who preferred the candidate listed in the row caption to the candidate listed in the column caption\n\n'''Result''': C has one win and no defeats, A has one win and one defeat. Thus, '''C''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Clones nominated =====\nAssume, all three clones would compete. The preferences would be the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C\n|-\n| 1           || B<sub>3</sub> > B > B<sub>2</sub> > C > A\n|-\n| 2           || C > A > B<sub>2</sub> > B > B<sub>3</sub>\n|}\n\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\n{| class=wikitable border=1\n|+ Pairwise Preferences\n|-\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 | \n| colspan=5 bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" align=center | X\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | A\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | B\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | B<sub>2</sub>\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | B<sub>3</sub>\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | C\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" rowspan=5 | Y\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | A\n|\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | B\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n| \n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | B<sub>2</sub>\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | B<sub>3</sub>\n| bgcolor=\"#e0e0ff\" | [X] 3 <br>[Y] 1\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | C\n| bgcolor=\"#ffe0e0\" | [X] 1 <br>[Y] 3\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n| bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\" | [X] 2 <br>[Y] 2\n|\n|-\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=\"#c0c0ff\" | Pairwise election results (won-tied-lost):\n| 3-0-1\n| 0-3-1\n| 0-3-1\n| 0-3-1\n| 1-3-0\n|}\n\n'''Result''': Still, C has one win and no defeat, but now A has three wins and one defeat. Thus, '''A''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nA benefits from the clones of the candidate he defeats, while C cannot benefit from the clones because C ties with all of them. Thus, by adding two clones of the non-winning candidate B, the winner has changed. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against crowding and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Teaming ====\nCopeland's method is also vulnerable against teaming, that is adding clones raises the winning chances of the set of clones. Again, assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 2 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !! Preferences\n|-\n| 1           || A > C > B > B<sub>3</sub> > B<sub>2</sub>\n|-\n| 1           || B > B<sub>2</sub> > B<sub>3</sub> > A > C\n|}\nNote, that B, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> form a clone set.\n\n===== Clones not nominated =====\nAssume that only one of the clones would compete.

Thus, '''B''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nB benefits from adding inferior clones, while A cannot benefit from the clones because he ties with all of them. So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from loser to winner. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against Teaming and fails the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Plurality voting ===\n{{Main|Plurality voting system}}\n\nSuppose there are two candidates, A and B, and 55% of the voters prefer A over B. A would win the election, 55% to 45%. But suppose the supporters of B also nominate an alternative similar to A, named A<sub>2</sub>. Assume a significant number of the voters who prefer A over B also prefer A<sub>2</sub> over A. When they vote for A<sub>2</sub>, this reduces A's total below 45%, causing B to win.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| A 55%\n| A 30%\n|- \n| A<sub>2</sub> not present\n| A<sub>2</sub> 25%\n|-\n| B 45%\n| B 45%\n|}\n\n=== Range voting ===\n{{Main|Range voting}}\n\nRange voting satisfies the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Voters changing their opinion ====\nHowever, like in every voting system, if voters change their opinions about candidates if similar candidates are added, adding clone candidates can change the outcome of an election. This can be seen by some premises and a simple example:\n\nIn range voting, to raise the influence of the ballot, the voter can give the maximum possible score to their most preferred alternative and the minimum possible score to their least preferred alternative.<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat3.html</ref> In fact, giving the maximum possible score to all candidates that are over some threshold and giving the minimum possible score to the other candidates, will maximize the influence of a ballot on the outcome.<ref>http://scorevoting.net/RVstrat7.html</ref> However, for this example it is necessary that the voter uses the first simple rule, but not the second.\n\nBegin by supposing there are 3 alternatives: A, B and B<sub>2</sub>, where B<sub>2</sub> is similar to B but considered inferior by the supporters of A and B. The voters supporting A would have the order of preference \"A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\" so that they give A the maximum possible score, they give B<sub>2</sub> the minimum possible score, and they give B a score that's somewhere in between (greater than the minimum). The supporters of B would have the order of preference \"B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\", so they give B the maximum possible score, A the minimum score and B<sub>2</sub> a score somewhere in between. Assume B narrowly wins the election.\n\nNow suppose B<sub>2</sub> isn't nominated. The voters supporting A who would have given B a score somewhere in between would now give B the minimum score while the supporters of B will still give B the maximum score, changing the winner to A. This violates the criterion.\nNote, that if the voters that support B would prefer B<sub>2</sub> to B, this result would not hold, since removing B<sub>2</sub> would raise the score B receives from his supporters in an analogous way as the score he receives from the supporters of A would decrease.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn is that considering all voters voting in a certain special way, range voting creates an incentive to nominate additional alternatives that are similar to one you prefer, but considered clearly inferior by his voters and by the voters of his opponent, since this can be expected to cause the voters supporting the opponent to raise their score of the one you prefer (because it looks better by comparison to the inferior ones), but not his own voters to lower their score.\n\n==== Strictly-interpreted definition of ranked-clones ====\nThe definition of a set of clones for the Independence of clones criterion has been created for ranked voting systems. For scored voting systems, this definition is not accurate. This can be seen by the following example:\n\nAssume three candidates A, B and C with the following scores:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!             !! colspan=3|Scores\n|-\n! # of voters !! A  !! B  !! C\n|-\n| 1           || 10 || 8  || 0\n|-\n| 1           || 0  || 8  || 9\n|}\n\nThe set {A, B} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives C a score between the scores of A and B.\n\nAlso, the set {B, C} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives A a score between the scores of B and C.\n\nThe set {A, C} is not a set of clones, since both voters gives B a score between the scores of A and C.\n\nSo, A is a clone of B, and B is a clone of C, but A is not a clone C.\n\nNow, if the election is held between A and C (without B), then A will win. If B is added, B will win. B is a clone of A, the winner in the first place. But B is also a clone of C, the loser in the first place. Thus, using the definition in its strict form, B must not win, because the inferior C cannot win.\n\nHowever, even in this strict version of the definition of clones, adding a non-winning clone does not change the chances of all candidates to win.\n\nNote, that Condorcet methods would lead to a tie between all candidates in this example. Whether Independence of clones is satisfied depends on the tie-breaker. Using the Schulze method or ranked pairs, simply choosing one of the tied candidates at random would raise the chance of the clone-set {A, B} from 50% if B don't compete to 67%, if B compete and thus, violate the criterion.\n\nHow the definition of clones have to be adapted for scored voting methods is controversial.\n\n=== Kemeny\u2013Young method ===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\n\nThis example shows that the Kemeny\u2013Young method violates the Independence of clones criterion. Assume five candidates A, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 13 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from winner to loser. Thus, the Kemeny\u2013Young method is vulnerable against spoilers and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Minimax ===\n{{Main|Minimax Condorcet}}\nThis example shows that the minimax method violates the Independence of clones criterion.

Thus, the minimax method is vulnerable against spoilers and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Strategic nomination]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n[[Category:Electoral system criteria]]\n", "text_old": "In [[voting system]]s theory, the '''independence of clones criterion''' measures an election method's robustness to [[strategic nomination]]. [[Nicolaus Tideman]] was the first to formulate this criterion, which states that the winner must not change due to the addition of a non-winning candidate who is similar to a candidate already present.<ref>T. Nicolaus Tideman, \"Independence of clones as a criterion for voting rules\", ''Social Choice and Welfare'' Vol. 4, No. 3 (1987), pp. 185&ndash;206.</ref>\n\nTo be more precise, a subset of the candidates, called a set of clones, exists if no voter ranks any candidate outside the set between (or equal to) any candidates that are in the set. If a set of clones contains at least two candidates, the criterion requires that deleting one of the clones must not increase or decrease the winning chance of any candidate not in the set of clones.\n\nIn some systems (such as the [[plurality vote]]), the addition of a similar candidate divides support between similar candidates, which can cause them both to lose. In some other systems (such as the [[Borda count]]), the addition of a similar alternative increases the apparent support for one of the similar candidates, which can cause it to win. In yet other systems (such as [[ranked pairs]]), the introduction of similar alternatives does not affect the chances of the dissimilar candidates, as required by the criterion. There are further systems where the effect of the additional similar alternatives depends on the distribution of other votes.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Clone negative and clone positive ==\nElection methods that fail independence of clones can be clone negative (the addition of a similar candidate decreases another candidate's chance of winning) or clone positive (the addition of a similar candidate increases another candidate's chance of winning). \n\nA method can also fail the independence of clones method in a way that's neither clone positive nor negative. This happens if the method changes its decision about the winner when a non-winning candidate is cloned, but the new winner is not the candidate that was cloned. The effect is called crowding.\n\nThe [[Borda count]] is an example of a clone positive method. [[Plurality voting]] is an example of a clone negative method because of [[vote-splitting]]. [[Copeland's method]] is an example of a method that exhibits crowding.\n\n== Compliant methods ==\n\n[[Instant-runoff voting]] and some election methods that comply with the [[Condorcet criterion]] such as [[ranked pairs]] and the [[Schulze method]]<ref>M. Schulze, \"A New Monotonic and Clone-Independent Single-Winner Election Method\", ''Voting Matters'' 17 (2003), pp 9&ndash;19.</ref> also meet independence of clones.\n\nThe interpretation of the term \"set of clones\" for scored voting systems is controversial. If clones are candidates that are considered nearly identical by the voters, [[range voting]] and [[majority judgment]] satisfy the criterion. If clones also include candidates that are still similar but clearly superior to an existing candidate, that superior clone can win in range voting, even if no inferior clone of that candidate would have won. However, since range voting and majority judgment satisfy the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion, the addition of clones never helps or harms candidates who are already present.\n\nSome of the other methods that fail the criterion are the [[Borda count]], [[Minimax Condorcet|minimax]], the [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]], [[Copeland's method]], [[Bucklin voting]], the [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]], and the [[two-round system]]. Variants of [[Instant-runoff voting]] that eliminate multiple candidates per round (e.g. the [[contingent vote]]) or forbid the voters from ranking all the candidates (e.g. the [[supplementary vote]]) also fail the criterion.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Borda count ===\n{{Main|Borda count}}\n\nConsider an election in which there are two candidates, A and B. Suppose the voters have the following preferences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B\n| 34%: B>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A would receive 66% Borda points (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d70) and B would receive 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). Thus candidate A would win by a 66% landslide.\n\nNow suppose supporters of B nominate an additional candidate, B<sub>2</sub>, that is very similar to B but considered inferior by all voters. For the 66% who prefer A, B continues to be their second choice. For the 34% who prefer B, A continues to be their least preferred candidate. Now the voters' preferences are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| 66%: A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\n| 34%: B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\n|}\n\nCandidate A now has 132% Borda points (66%\u00d72 + 34%\u00d70). B has 134% (66%\u00d71 + 34%\u00d72). B<sub>2</sub> has 34% (66%\u00d70 + 34%\u00d71). The nomination of B<sub>2</sub> changes the winner from A to B, overturning the landslide, even though the additional information about voters' preferences is redundant due to the similarity of B<sub>2</sub> to B.\n\nSimilar examples can be constructed to show that ''given the Borda count, any arbitrarily large landslide can be overturned by adding enough candidates'' (assuming at least one voter prefers the landslide loser). For example, to overturn a 90% landslide preference for A over B, add 9 alternatives similar/inferior to B. Then A's score would be 900% (90%\u00d710 + 10%\u00d70) and B's score would be 910% (90%\u00d79 + 10%\u00d710).\n\nNo knowledge of the voters' preferences is needed to exploit this strategy. Factions could simply nominate as many alternatives as possible that are similar to their preferred alternative.\n\nIn typical elections, game theory suggests this manipulability of Borda can be expected to be a serious problem, particularly when a significant number of voters can be expected to vote their sincere order of preference (as in public elections, where many voters are not strategically sophisticated; cite Michael R. Alvarez of Caltech). Small minorities typically have the power to nominate additional candidates, and typically it is easy to find additional candidates that are similar.\n\nIn the context of people running for office, people can take similar positions on the issues, and in the context of voting on proposals, it is easy to construct similar proposals. Game theory suggests that all factions would seek to nominate as many similar candidates as possible since the winner would depend on the number of similar candidates, regardless of the voters' preferences.\n\n=== Copeland ===\n{{Main|Copeland's method}}\nThis examples show that Copeland's method violates the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Crowding ====\nCopeland's method is vulnerable against crowding, that is the outcome of the election is changed by adding (non-winning) clones of a non-winning candidate. Assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 4 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Thus, '''A''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nA benefits from the clones of the candidate he defeats, while C cannot benefit from the clones because C ties with all of them. Thus, by adding two clones of the non-winning candidate B, the winner has changed. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against crowding and fails the independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Teaming ====\nCopeland's method is also vulnerable against teaming, that is adding clones raises the winning chances of the set of clones. Again, assume five candidates A, B, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 2 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Thus, '''B''' is elected Copeland winner.\n\n===== Conclusion =====\nB benefits from adding inferior clones, while A cannot benefit from the clones because he ties with all of them. So, by adding two clones of B, B changed from loser to winner. Thus, Copeland's method is vulnerable against Teaming and fails the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n=== Plurality voting ===\n{{Main|Plurality voting system}}\n\nSuppose there are two candidates, A and B, and 55% of the voters prefer A over B. A would win the election, 55% to 45%. But suppose the supporters of B also nominate an alternative similar to A, named A<sub>2</sub>. Assume a significant number of the voters who prefer A over B also prefer A<sub>2</sub> over A. When they vote for A<sub>2</sub>, this reduces A's total below 45%, causing B to win.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| A 55%\n| A 30%\n|- \n| A<sub>2</sub> not present\n| A<sub>2</sub> 25%\n|-\n| B 45%\n| B 45%\n|}\n\n=== Range Voting ===\n{{Main|Range voting}}\n\nRange voting satisfies the Independence of clones criterion.\n\n==== Voters changing their opinion ====\nHowever, like in every voting system, if voters change their opinions about candidates if similar candidates are added, adding clone candidates can change the outcome of an election. This can be seen by some premises and a simple example:\n\nIn range voting, to raise the influence of the ballot, the voter can give the maximum possible score to their most preferred alternative and the minimum possible score to their least preferred alternative.<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat3.html</ref> In fact, giving the maximum possible score to all candidates that are over some threshold and giving the minimum possible score to the other candidates, will maximize the influence of a ballot on the outcome.<ref>http://scorevoting.net/RVstrat7.html</ref> However, for this example it is necessary that the voter uses the first simple rule, but not the second.\n\nBegin by supposing there are 3 alternatives: A, B and B<sub>2</sub>, where B<sub>2</sub> is similar to B but considered inferior by the supporters of A and B. The voters supporting A would have the order of preference \"A>B>B<sub>2</sub>\" so that they give A the maximum possible score, they give B<sub>2</sub> the minimum possible score, and they give B a score that's somewhere in between (greater than the minimum). The supporters of B would have the order of preference \"B>B<sub>2</sub>>A\", so they give B the maximum possible score, A the minimum score and B<sub>2</sub> a score somewhere in between. Assume B narrowly wins the election.\n\nNow suppose B<sub>2</sub> isn't nominated. The voters supporting A who would have given B a score somewhere in between would now give B the minimum score while the supporters of B will still give B the maximum score, changing the winner to A. This violates the criterion.\nNote, that if the voters that support B would prefer B<sub>2</sub> to B, this result would not hold, since removing B<sub>2</sub> would raise the score B receives from his supporters in an analogous way as the score he receives from the supporters of A would decrease.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn is that considering all voters voting in a certain special way, range voting creates an incentive to nominate additional alternatives that are similar to one you prefer, but considered clearly inferior by his voters and by the voters of his opponent, since this can be expected to cause the voters supporting the opponent to raise their score of the one you prefer (because it looks better by comparison to the inferior ones), but not his own voters to lower their score.\n\n==== Strictly-interpreted definition of ranked-clones ====\nThe definition of a set of clones for the Independence of clones criterion has been created for ranked voting systems. For scored voting systems, this definition is not accurate. This can be seen by the following example:\n\nAssume three candidates A, B and C with the following scores:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!             !! colspan=3|Scores\n|-\n! # of voters !! A  !! B  !! C\n|-\n| 1           || 10 || 8  || 0\n|-\n| 1           || 0  || 8  || 9\n|}\n\nThe set {A, B} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives C a score between the scores of A and B.\n\nAlso, the set {B, C} is a set of clones, since there is no voter that gives A a score between the scores of B and C.\n\nThe set {A, C} is not a set of clones, since both voters gives B a score between the scores of A and C.\n\nSo, A is a clone of B, and B is a clone of C, but A is not a clone C.\n\nNow, if the election is held between A and C (without B), then A will win. If B is added, B will win. B is a clone of A, the winner in the first place. But B is also a clone of C, the loser in the first place. Thus, using the definition in its strict form, B must not win, because the inferior C cannot win.\n\nHowever, even in this strict version of the definition of clones, adding a non-winning clone does not change the chances of all candidates to win.\n\nNote, that Condorcet methods would lead to a tie between all candidates in this example. Whether Independence of clones is satisfied depends on the tie-breaker. Using the Schulze method or ranked pairs, simply choosing one of the tied candidates at random would raise the chance of the clone-set {A, B} from 50% if B don't compete to 67%, if B compete and thus, violate the criterion.\n\nHow the definition of clones have to be adapted for scored voting methods is controversial.\n\n=== Kemeny\u2013Young method ===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\n\nThis example shows that the Kemeny\u2013Young method violates the Independence of clones criterion. Assume five candidates A, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> and C and 13 voters with the following preferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # of voters !!

Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]]. During holidays, it was common to see families of four driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a [[roof rack]]; sightings of PF-126s towing a small [[:pl:Niewiad\u00f3w N126|Niewiad\u00f3w N126]] caravan especially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported.<ref name=zakrz/> PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was on sale with a waiting list.

Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS.

Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]]. During holidays, it was common to see families of four driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a [[roof rack]]; sightings of PF-126s towing a small [[:pl:Niewiad\u00f3w N126|Niewiad\u00f3w N126]] caravan especially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported.<ref name=zakrz/> PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was on sale with a waiting list.

The components of a communications [[system]] serve a common purpose, are technically compatible, use common procedures, respond to controls, and operate in union. \n\nTelecommunications is a method of communication (e.g., for sports [[broadcasting]], [[mass media]], [[journalism]], etc.). Communication is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules\n\n== Types ==\n=== By media===\nAn [[optical communication]] system is any form of [[telecommunication]] that uses [[light]] as the transmission medium. Equipment consists of a transmitter, which encodes a ''message'' into an optical ''[[signal]]'', a ''[[communication channel]]'', which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. [[Fiber-optic communication]] systems transmit information from one place to another by sending [[light]] through an [[optical fiber]]. The light forms a [[carrier signal]] that is [[Modulation|modulated]] to carry information.\n\nA [[radio communication system]] is composed of several communications subsystems that give exterior communications capabilities.<ref>Schwartz, M., Bennett, W.

Different types of powerline communications use different frequency bands, depending on the signal transmission characteristics of the power wiring used. Since the power wiring system was originally intended for transmission of AC power, the power wire circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies. The propagation problem is a limiting factor for each type of power line communications.\n\n===By technology===\nA [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex communication system]] is a system composed of two connected parties or devices which can communicate with one another in both directions. The term ''duplex'' is used when describing communication between two parties or devices. Duplex systems are employed in nearly all communications networks, either to allow for a communication \"two-way street\" between two connected parties or to provide a \"reverse path\" for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field.\nAn [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]] is basically a small length of a qwert conductor that is used to radiate or receive electromagnetic waves.\nIt acts as a conversion device. At the transmitting end it converts high frequency current into electromagnetic waves. At the receiving end it transforms electromagnetic waves into electrical signals that is fed into the input of the receiver. several types of antenna are used in communication.\n\nExamples of communications subsystems include the [[Defense Information Systems Agency|Defense Communications System]] (DCS).\n'''\n\n===Examples: by technology===\n*Telephone\n*Mobile\n*Telegraph\n*Edison Telegraph\n*T.V.

These systems are commonly designed to integrate the cross-communication of messages between are variety of communication technologies.\n\nAn [[Automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is a communication system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for product or service complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).\n\nA [[Voice Communication Control System]] (VCCS) is essentially an ACD with characteristics that make it more adapted to use in critical situations (no waiting for dialtone, or lengthy recorded announcements, radio and telephone lines equally easily connected to, individual lines immediately accessible etc..)\n\n<br />\n\n= LAB\u00a0 01 =\n\n= \u00a0 INTRODUCTION TO MATLAB =\n'''Objectives:'''\n\n(a)\u00a0 To get acquainted with MATLAB\u2019s environment.\n\n(b)\u00a0 To use MATLAB as a calculator.\n\n(c)\u00a0 To learn to create MATLAB variables and basic plots.\n\n(d)\u00a0 To learn to initialize and manipulate vectors, matrices.\n\n'''Pre-lab theory:'''\n\n'''What is MATLAB?'''\n\nMATLAB is a software program that allows you to do data manipulation and visualization, calculations, math and programming.

Examples of sources include but are not limited to the following:\n* Audio Files (MP3, WAV, etc...)\n* Graphic Image Files (GIFs)\n* Email Messages\n* Human Voice\n* Television Picture\n* Electromagnetic Radiation\n\n=== Input transducers (sensors) ===\nSensors, like microphones and cameras, capture non-electric sources, like sound and light (respectively), and convert them into electrical signals.  These types of sensors are called '''input transducers''' in modern analog and digital communication systems.  Without input transducers there would not be an effective way to transport non-electric sources or signals over great distances, i.e. humans would have to rely solely on our eyes and ears to see and hear things despite the distances. \n\nOther examples of input transducers include:\n* Microphones\n* Cameras\n* Keyboards\n* Mouse (See Computer Peripherals)\n* Force Sensors\n* Accelerometers\n\n=== Transmitter ===\nOnce the source signal has been converted into an electric signal, the transmitter will modify this signal for efficient transmission.  In order to do this, the signal must pass through an electronic circuit containing the following components:\n# Noise Filter\n# Analog to digital converter (A/D converter)\n# Encoder\n# Modulator\n# Signal Amplifier\nAfter the signal has been amplified, it is ready for transmission.  At the end of the circuit is an antenna, the point at which the signal is released as electromagnetic waves (or electromagnetic radiation).\n\n=== Communication channel ===\nA communication channel is simply referring to the medium by which a signal travels.  There are two types of media by which electrical signals travel, i.e. '''guided''' and '''unguided'''. Guided media refers to any medium that can be directed from transmitter to receiver by means of connecting cables.  In optical fiber communication, the medium is an optical (glass-like) fiber.  Other guided media might include coaxial cables, telephone wire, twisted-pairs, etc... The other type of media, unguided media, refers to any communication channel that creates space between the transmitter and receiver.  For radio or RF communication, the medium is air.  Air is the only thing between the transmitter and receiver for RF communication while in other cases, like sonar, the medium is usually water because sound waves travel efficiently through certain liquid media. Both types of media are considered unguided because there are no connecting cables between the transmitter and receiver.  Communication channels include almost everything from the vacuum of space to solid pieces of metal; however, some mediums are preferred more than others.  That is because differing sources travel through subjective mediums with fluctuating efficiencies.\n\n=== Receiver ===\nOnce the signal has passed through the communication channel, it must be effectively captured by a receiver.  The goal of the receiver is to capture and reconstruct the signal before it passed through the transmitter (i.e. the A/D converter, modulator and encoder).  This is done by passing the \"received\" signal through another circuit containing the following components:\n# Noise Filter\n# Digital to analog converter (D/A converter)\n# Decoder\n# Demodulator\n# Signal Amplifier\nMost likely the signal will have lost some of its energy after having passed through the communication channel or medium.  The signal can be boosted by passing it through a signal amplifier.\nWhen the analog signal converted into digital signal.\n\n=== Output transducer ===\nThe output transducer simply converts the electric signal (created by the input transducer) back into its original form.  Examples of output transducers include but are not limited to the following:\n* Speakers (Audio)\n* Monitors (See Computer Peripherals)\n* Motors (Movement)\n* Lighting (Visual)\n\n=== Other ===\nSome common pairs of input and output transducers include:\n# microphones and speakers (audio signals)\n# keyboards and computer monitors\n# cameras and liquid crystal displays (LCDs)\n# force sensors (buttons) and lights or motors\n\nAgain, input transducers convert non-electric signals like voice into electric signals that can be transmitted over great distances very quickly.  Output transducers convert the electric signal back into sound or picture, etc...  There are many different types of transducers and the combinations are limitless.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Hansell, Clarence W., ''{{US patent|2389432}}'', \"''Communication system by pulses through the Earth''\".\n* {{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications systems| ]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n[[Category:Military communications]]\n[[Category:Technology systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Aspect of study in telecommunications}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}\n\n[[Image:Communication-System.png|thumb|400px|Communication system]]\n[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|400px|An electronic communications system using [[Signal (electronics)|electronic signals]] ]]\nIn [[telecommunication]], a '''communications system''' or '''communication system''' is a collection of individual [[information transfer|communications]] networks, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] systems, [[relay]] stations, tributary stations, and [[data]] [[terminal equipment]] ([[Data terminal equipment|DTE]]) usually capable of [[interconnection]] and [[interoperation]] to form an integrated whole.   The components of a communications [[system]] serve a common purpose, are technically compatible, use common procedures, respond to controls, and operate in union. \n\nTelecommunications is a method of communication (e.g., for sports [[broadcasting]], [[mass media]], [[journalism]], etc.). Communication is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules\n\n== Types ==\n=== By media===\nAn [[optical communication]] system is any form of [[telecommunication]] that uses [[light]] as the transmission medium. Equipment consists of a transmitter, which encodes a ''message'' into an optical ''[[signal]]'', a ''[[communication channel]]'', which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. [[Fiber-optic communication]] systems transmit information from one place to another by sending [[light]] through an [[optical fiber]]. The light forms a [[carrier signal]] that is [[Modulation|modulated]] to carry information.\n\nA [[radio communication system]] is composed of several communications subsystems that give exterior communications capabilities.<ref>Schwartz, M., Bennett, W.

Different types of powerline communications use different frequency bands, depending on the signal transmission characteristics of the power wiring used. Since the power wiring system was originally intended for transmission of AC power, the power wire circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies. The propagation problem is a limiting factor for each type of power line communications.\n\n===By technology===\nA [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex communication system]] is a system composed of two connected parties or devices which can communicate with one another in both directions. The term ''duplex'' is used when describing communication between two parties or devices. Duplex systems are employed in nearly all communications networks, either to allow for a communication \"two-way street\" between two connected parties or to provide a \"reverse path\" for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field.\nAn [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]] is basically a small length of a qwert conductor that is used to radiate or receive electromagnetic waves.\nIt acts as a conversion device. At the transmitting end it converts high frequency current into electromagnetic waves. At the receiving end it transforms electromagnetic waves into electrical signals that is fed into the input of the receiver. several types of antenna are used in communication.\n\nExamples of communications subsystems include the [[Defense Information Systems Agency|Defense Communications System]] (DCS).\n'''\n\n===Examples: by technology===\n*Telephone\n*Mobile\n*Telegraph\n*Edison Telegraph\n*T.V.

These systems are commonly designed to integrate the cross-communication of messages between are variety of communication technologies.\n\nAn [[Automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is a communication system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for product or service complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).\n\nA [[Voice Communication Control System]] (VCCS) is essentially an ACD with characteristics that make it more adapted to use in critical situations (no waiting for dialtone, or lengthy recorded announcements, radio and telephone lines equally easily connected to, individual lines immediately accessible etc..)\n\n== Key components ==\n===<span lang=\"ms\" dir=\"ltr\">Sources</span>===\nSources can be classified as '''electric''' or '''non-electric'''; they are the origins of a message or input signal.

It was founded as \"'''New Hall'''\" in 1954 but, unlike many other colleges, it was founded without a significant endowment and thus did not bear a benefactor's name. This situation changed in 2008 following a donation of \u00a330 million by alumna Ros Edwards (''n\u00e9e'' Smith) and her husband Steve Edwards to secure the future of the College as a college at the University of Cambridge in perpetuity. In recognition of this, New Hall was renamed Murray Edwards College, honouring the first President, [[Rosemary Murray|Dame Rosemary Murray]] and the donors.<ref>Polly Curtis [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2286079,00.html \"After 50 years as plain old New Hall, Cambridge college gets a \u00a330m donation \u2013 and a new name\"], ''The Guardian'', 18 June 2008.

This was at a time when Cambridge had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in the [[United Kingdom]], and when only two other colleges ([[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]]) admitted female students.\n\nIn 1962, members of the [[Emma Darwin|Darwin family]] gave their home, \"The Orchard\", to the College. This new site was located on Huntingdon Road, about a mile from the centre of Cambridge. The architects chosen were [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who are known for their design of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] in London, and fundraising commenced. The building work began in 1964 and was completed by [[W. & C. French]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F3124%2FNHAR%202%2F8%2F1|title=New Hall Archives|publisher=Janus| accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> The new college could house up to 300 students.\n\nIn 1967, one of the College's PhD students, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], a researcher in the university [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|radio astronomy group]], discovered the first four [[pulsars]], leading to a [[Nobel Prize]] for her supervisor, and for Jocelyn Bell-Burnell herself, ultimately a position as a Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nIn 1975, the College's President Dame [[Rosemary Murray]] became the first woman to hold the post of [[Rosemary Murray|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge]]. Since then, two subsequent presidents, [[Anne Lonsdale]] and [[Jennifer Barnes]], have become Pro-Vice-Chancellors of the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nIn early 2008, Cambridge had decided to change the name of the colleges to Murray Edwards College, leading to protests.<ref name=Murray>{{cite web |last1=Wilce |first1=Hilary |title=Cambridge alumnae protest at plans to rename New Hall college |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/cambridge-alumnae-protest-at-plans-to-rename-new-hall-college-910221.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtis |first1=Polly |title=After 50 years as plain old New Hall, Cambridge college gets a \u00a330m donation \u2013 and a new name |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jun/18/highereducation.uk |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 November 2019 |archivedate=17 June 2008}}</ref> There was some opposition to this as the new name of the college incorporates a male surname, despite the college being reserved for women students.<ref name=\"Murray\" />\n\nMen-only Cambridge colleges were converted into mixed-sex colleges in the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[heraldry|Arms]] of the college are emblazoned as follows:\n\n:''Sable a Dolphin palewise head downwards to the dexter in chief three Mullets fesswise a Bordure embattled Argent''\n\nIn plain English, this means: on a black background, place the following features in silver. Vertically in the centre, place a dolphin with head downwards to the left. On top, place three stars horizontally across.

[[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|constituent college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. It was founded as \"'''New Hall'''\" in 1954 but, unlike many other colleges, it was founded without a significant endowment and thus did not bear a benefactor's name. This situation changed in 2008 following a donation of \u00a330 million by alumna Ros Edwards (''n\u00e9e'' Smith) and her husband Steve Edwards to secure the future of the College as a college at the University of Cambridge in perpetuity. In recognition of this, New Hall was renamed Murray Edwards College, honouring the first President, [[Rosemary Murray|Dame Rosemary Murray]] and the donors.<ref>Polly Curtis [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2286079,00.html \"After 50 years as plain old New Hall, Cambridge college gets a \u00a330m donation \u2013 and a new name\"], ''The Guardian'', 18 June 2008.

This was at a time when Cambridge had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in the [[United Kingdom]], and when only two other colleges ([[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]]) admitted female students.\n\nIn 1962, members of the [[Emma Darwin|Darwin family]] gave their home, \"The Orchard\", to the College. This new site was located on Huntingdon Road, about a mile from the centre of Cambridge.

The building work began in 1964 and was completed by [[W. & C. French]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F3124%2FNHAR%202%2F8%2F1|title=New Hall Archives|publisher=Janus| accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> The new college could house up to 300 students.\n\nIn 1967, one of the College's PhD students, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], a researcher in the university [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|radio astronomy group]], discovered the first four [[pulsars]], leading to a [[Nobel Prize]] for her supervisor, and for Jocelyn Bell-Burnell herself, ultimately a position as a Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nIn 1975, the College's President Dame [[Rosemary Murray]] became the first woman to hold the post of [[Rosemary Murray|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge]].

The script was widely used during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period. In the 1880s, during the [[British Raj]], the script was recognised as the official script of the [[law court]]s of [[Bihar]]. Kaithi was the most widely used script of North India west of Bengal. In 1854, 77,368 school primers were in Kaithi script, as compared to 25,151 in Devanagari and 24,302 in [[Mahajani]].<ref>Rai, Alok. \"Hindi Nationalism\", p. 13</ref> Among the three scripts widely used in the '[[Hindi Belt]]', Kaithi was widely perceived to be neutral, as it was used by both Hindus and Muslims alike for day-to-day correspondence, financial, and administrative activities, while Devanagari was used by Hindus and Persian script by Muslims for religious literature and education. This made Kaithi increasingly unfavorable to the more conservative and religiously inclined members of society who insisted on Devanagari-based and Persian-based transcription of Hindi dialects. As a result of their influence and due to the wide availability of Devanagari type as opposed to the incredibly large variability of Kaithi, Devanagari was promoted, particularly in the Northwest Provinces, which covers present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref>General Report on Public Instruction in the Bengal Presidency, p. 103.</ref> Kaithi was also nicknamed \"Shikasta Nagari\" by analogy with [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq#Shekasteh_Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq|Shikasta Nastaliq]], because the relationship of Kaithi to Devanagari was perceived as akin to the relationship between the widely used dot-less Shikasta Nastaliq of the time and the more formal printed Nastaliq scripts, which used dotted letters and fuller, less abbreviated letter forms.\n\n==Consonants==\nAll Kaithi consonants have an inherent ''a'' vowel:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[Occlusive]]s\n! rowspan=3 | !! colspan=5 | [[Voicelessness|{{sc|Voiceless}}]] {{sc|Plosives}} !! colspan=5 | [[Voice (phonetics)|{{sc|Voiced}}]] {{sc|Plosives}} !! colspan=3 rowspan=2 | [[Nasal consonant|{{sc|Nasals}}]]\n|-\n! colspan=3 | ''Unaspirated'' !! colspan=2 | ''[[Aspirated consonant|Aspirated]]'' !! colspan=3 | ''Unaspirated'' !! colspan=2 | ''Aspirated''\n|-\n!

It is designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] by the Japanese Government. It is a port city located on the [[Seto Inland Sea]], and is the closest port to [[Honshu]] from Shikoku island. For this reason it flourished under the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) as a castle town in the fiefdom of Takamatsu, during the [[Edo period]]. Takamatsu is a city with a large concentration of nationwide companies' branch offices, which play a large role in its economy, and it contains most of the national government's branch offices for Shikoku. The castle tower formerly used as the symbol of the city was destroyed during the [[Meiji period]]. In 2004, construction of the Symbol Tower, the new symbol of Takamatsu, was completed. The Symbol Tower is located in the [[Sunport Takamatsu|Sunport]] area of the city. The Symbol Tower is the tallest building in Takamatsu, and is right next to another tall building The JR Clement Hotel (formerly the ANA Clement Hotel), which is also part of the Sunport complex.\n\nThe [[Sunport Takamatsu]] covers the area of the Symbol Tower, the JR Clement Hotel, and a miniature mall called Maritime Plaza.

Designated as a Special Place of Scenic Beauty by the Japanese government, Ritsurin Garden is especially popular during spring and autumn where night-time illuminations showcase cherry blossoms and autumn colours respectively.\n\n[[Takamatsu Castle (Sanuki)|Takamatsu Castle]] is known for using seawater in its moat and recently the old keep of the castle was successfully restored and opened for public viewing.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ja:\u9ad8\u677e\u57ce\u5929\u5b88\u95a3\u5fa9\u5143|url = http://www.takamatsujyo.com/tensyukaku.htm|website = www.takamatsujyo.com|access-date = 2016-01-19}}</ref>\n\nIn the east of Takamatsu City lies the Yashima lava plateau which is home to various sightseeing spots. At the base of the mountain is the open air museum [[Shikoku Mura]] where aspects of regional history and culture are exhibited. On the mountain itself is [[Yashima-ji]], number 84 of the Shikoku 88 temple pilgrimage. At the top of the mountain there is also an observation deck which offers views across the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nTakamatsu also acts as a hub to access various islands of the Seto Inland Sea. These include, [[Megijima]], [[Ogijima]], [[Naoshima, Kagawa|Naoshima]], [[Teshima]] and [[Sh\u014ddoshima]]. Since 2010, Takamatsu, along with these islands and more, has been host to the [[Setouchi Triennale]], a contemporary art festival with many outdoor exhibitions by prominent artists from across the world.\n\n==Economy==\nCompanies headquartered in the city include:\n*[[Shikoku Railway Company]]<ref>\"[http://www.jr-shikoku.co.jp/04_company/company/gaiyou.shtm Company Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324005655/http://www.jr-shikoku.co.jp/04_company/company/gaiyou.shtm |date=2010-03-24 }}.\" [[Shikoku Railway Company]].
