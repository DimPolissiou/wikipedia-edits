Today, it forms part of the [[new town]] of [[Telford]], which was originally, in 1963, going to be named 'Dawley New Town' before it was decided in 1968 to name the town 'Telford', after the engineer and road-builder [[Thomas Telford]]. \n\nDawley is one of the older settlements in Shropshire, being mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). It is divided into ''Dawley Magna'' (\"Great Dawley\") and [[Dawley Hamlets|Little Dawley]] (also shown as ''Dawley Parva'' (\"Little Dawley\") on older maps).\n\n==Local government==\nThe town's main [[civil parish]] is officially called '''Great Dawley''' \u2014 its [[parish councils in England|parish council]] is officially Great Dawley Town Council. [[Dawley Hamlets]] is a separate civil parish, which covers Little Dawley and other neighbouring villages/suburbs.\n\n==Railways==\nThe nearest railway station is [[Telford Central railway station|Telford Central]]. Historically, the [[Great Western Railway]] maintained a line that passed through the parish, going through the tunnel at [[Heath Hill]]. This tunnel is still used and is currently part of [[Telford Steam Railway]]'s expansion project. It was also served by the single platformed station at [[Dawley and Stirchley railway station]] on the [[Coalport Branch Line]] which ran from [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]] to [[Coalport]]. It opened in 1860 but closed in 1952 and the trackbed including platform now form part of the [[Silkin Way]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/1745/silkin_way_-_cycling_and_walking_route |title=Silkin Way - cycling and walking route |work=Telford and Wrekin Council |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDawley is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] and is therefore one of the older settlements in Shropshire.\n\nThere was a castle in Dawley, but it was demolished around 1648. The site is unknown, although the Castle Pools (on the old quarry site) and Castle Ironworks (built by the [[Abraham Darby III|Darby family]], one of whom commissioned the world-famous [[Ironbridge|Iron Bridge]]) possibly indicate the general area where it may have stood. Prior to the landscaping which followed the creation of Telford New Town, extensive ruins were detectable next to the Castle Pools and are shown on old maps as being the location of the castle, but, in the 1980s, the whole area was buried under thick topsoil and planted with trees. [[Ironbridge]] is a short distance away.\n\nDawley was, for over three centuries, a mining town, both for coal and [[ironstone]]. Clay extraction, for local industrial-pipe factories, brickyards and the pottery industry, has been a major influence on the landscape. The mining had an important impact on the local culture. In 1821, production at the ironworks of Dawley was halted for a say by striking miners in protest at a lowering of their wages. Many of the workers in Dawley joined the larger group of protesters in what came to be known as the [[Cinderloo Uprising]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mercer|first=A. C. B|date=January 1966|title=Cinderloo Affair|url=|journal=Shropshire Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In 1872, the [[Springwell Pit Disaster]] resulted in the deaths of eight men and boys.\n\nPrior to large-scale levelling as part of the development of Telford New Town, the area was covered by clay mounds and large clay pits that dominated the landscape, to the extent that they formed points of reference for the locals. There is still a local clay-pipe factory in the adjacent Doseley village; grey clay predominates on the immediate outskirts of Dawley.\n\nThe adjacent village of [[Horsehay]] was the site of a bridge and later a crane fabrication factory that exported around the world. The bridge over [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] is said to have been built there. [[Telford Steam Railway]] trust is located across the road from the former factory site.\n\nOn Monday, 7 June 2010, Dawley had become subject to a lot of media attention because some locals had recreated the 'Hollywood' sign on a noticeable bank on Paddock Mount but with ''Dawley'' instead of ''Hollywood''. The [[Shropshire Star]] had a full-page spread article on that day's evening edition to honour the effort made by the locals. As of midday on Tuesday, 8 June 2010, over 1000 Telfordians had joined a Facebook group showing support for the sign, acknowledging the efforts of its creators, and in protest against the controversial redevelopment of the mount to move the Phoenix Academy (now the [[Telford Langley School]]) there.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local newspaper article about the Hollywood style sign|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2010/08/14/work-starts-to-pave-way-for-dawley-sports-site/|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Shropshire Star|date=14 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nDawley is famed for its dialect, which includes some quite unique words, including \"bist\", presumably from the German meaning \"are\". However, the dialect is largely lost. Along with the dialect were various conventions and traditions, notably the \"pig on the wall\". Traditionally, Dawley residents would show their support for The Dawley Prize Band or other civic marches by placing their pigs on their walls. The pig also features in the dialect, with a romantic phrase apparently being \"I wudna swop thee for a big black pig!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldscroteshome.blogspot.com/2006/09/ow-bist-owd-jockey.html |title=Dawley Dialect |accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:TelfordMap.jpg|thumb|right|Dawley and [[Stirchley, Shropshire|Stirchley]] shown within [[Telford]] in <span style=\"color:#5D6864;\">Grey</span>.]]\n\nDawley has a street-market every Friday. Dawley town centre consists of a single pedestrianised street that was previously the main route from Bridgnorth in the south to Wellington in the north. The area around Dawley, not covered by Telford New Town, is rural and provides extensive opportunities for walking. The [[Ironbridge Gorge]] and [[The Wrekin]] are both pleasant walks from Dawley.\n\nOn the northern edge of Dawley is [[Malinslee]] where [http://stleonard.wordpress.com St. Leonards] church stands.\nThe design of St. Leonards, a slightly irregular octagon, is said to have been influenced by Thomas Telford.\nOther churches supposedly influenced by [[Thomas Telford]] during his work in Shropshire are at nearby [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Bridgnorth]].\n[[Image:St leonards small.jpg|thumb|left|alt=St. Leonards Church Malinslee|St. Leonards Church Malinslee]]\n\n==Education==\nThere are seven primary schools in the Dawley area, and a comprehensive secondary school, [[Telford Langley School]].

Today, it forms part of the [[new town]] of [[Telford]], which was originally, in 1963, going to be named 'Dawley New Town' before it was decided in 1968 to name the town 'Telford', after the engineer and road-builder [[Thomas Telford]]. It holds the greatest goalkeeper to ever grace the town of Telford, Mitchell Delamere. His clean sheets speak for themselves and only lacks skill when he misses the bus.\n\nDawley is one of the older settlements in Shropshire, being mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). It is divided into ''Dawley Magna'' (\"Great Dawley\") and [[Dawley Hamlets|Little Dawley]] (also shown as ''Dawley Parva'' (\"Little Dawley\") on older maps).\n\n==Local government==\nThe town's main [[civil parish]] is officially called '''Great Dawley''' \u2014 its [[parish councils in England|parish council]] is officially Great Dawley Town Council. [[Dawley Hamlets]] is a separate civil parish, which covers Little Dawley and other neighbouring villages/suburbs.\n\n==Railways==\nThe nearest railway station is [[Telford Central railway station|Telford Central]]. Historically, the [[Great Western Railway]] maintained a line that passed through the parish, going through the tunnel at [[Heath Hill]]. This tunnel is still used and is currently part of [[Telford Steam Railway]]'s expansion project. It was also served by the single platformed station at [[Dawley and Stirchley railway station]] on the [[Coalport Branch Line]] which ran from [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]] to [[Coalport]]. It opened in 1860 but closed in 1952 and the trackbed including platform now form part of the [[Silkin Way]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telford.gov.uk/downloads/file/1745/silkin_way_-_cycling_and_walking_route |title=Silkin Way - cycling and walking route |work=Telford and Wrekin Council |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDawley is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] and is therefore one of the older settlements in Shropshire.\n\nThere was a castle in Dawley, but it was demolished around 1648. The site is unknown, although the Castle Pools (on the old quarry site) and Castle Ironworks (built by the [[Abraham Darby III|Darby family]], one of whom commissioned the world-famous [[Ironbridge|Iron Bridge]]) possibly indicate the general area where it may have stood. Prior to the landscaping which followed the creation of Telford New Town, extensive ruins were detectable next to the Castle Pools and are shown on old maps as being the location of the castle, but, in the 1980s, the whole area was buried under thick topsoil and planted with trees. [[Ironbridge]] is a short distance away.\n\nDawley was, for over three centuries, a mining town, both for coal and [[ironstone]]. Clay extraction, for local industrial-pipe factories, brickyards and the pottery industry, has been a major influence on the landscape. The mining had an important impact on the local culture. In 1821, production at the ironworks of Dawley was halted for a say by striking miners in protest at a lowering of their wages. Many of the workers in Dawley joined the larger group of protesters in what came to be known as the [[Cinderloo Uprising]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mercer|first=A. C. B|date=January 1966|title=Cinderloo Affair|url=|journal=Shropshire Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In 1872, the [[Springwell Pit Disaster]] resulted in the deaths of eight men and boys.\n\nPrior to large-scale levelling as part of the development of Telford New Town, the area was covered by clay mounds and large clay pits that dominated the landscape, to the extent that they formed points of reference for the locals. There is still a local clay-pipe factory in the adjacent Doseley village; grey clay predominates on the immediate outskirts of Dawley.\n\nThe adjacent village of [[Horsehay]] was the site of a bridge and later a crane fabrication factory that exported around the world. The bridge over [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] is said to have been built there. [[Telford Steam Railway]] trust is located across the road from the former factory site.\n\nOn Monday, 7 June 2010, Dawley had become subject to a lot of media attention because some locals had recreated the 'Hollywood' sign on a noticeable bank on Paddock Mount but with ''Dawley'' instead of ''Hollywood''. The [[Shropshire Star]] had a full-page spread article on that day's evening edition to honour the effort made by the locals. As of midday on Tuesday, 8 June 2010, over 1000 Telfordians had joined a Facebook group showing support for the sign, acknowledging the efforts of its creators, and in protest against the controversial redevelopment of the mount to move the Phoenix Academy (now the [[Telford Langley School]]) there.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local newspaper article about the Hollywood style sign|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2010/08/14/work-starts-to-pave-way-for-dawley-sports-site/|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Shropshire Star|date=14 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nDawley is famed for its dialect, which includes some quite unique words, including \"bist\", presumably from the German meaning \"are\". However, the dialect is largely lost. Along with the dialect were various conventions and traditions, notably the \"pig on the wall\". Traditionally, Dawley residents would show their support for The Dawley Prize Band or other civic marches by placing their pigs on their walls. The pig also features in the dialect, with a romantic phrase apparently being \"I wudna swop thee for a big black pig!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldscroteshome.blogspot.com/2006/09/ow-bist-owd-jockey.html |title=Dawley Dialect |accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:TelfordMap.jpg|thumb|right|Dawley and [[Stirchley, Shropshire|Stirchley]] shown within [[Telford]] in <span style=\"color:#5D6864;\">Grey</span>.]]\n\nDawley has a street-market every Friday. Dawley town centre consists of a single pedestrianised street that was previously the main route from Bridgnorth in the south to Wellington in the north. The area around Dawley, not covered by Telford New Town, is rural and provides extensive opportunities for walking. The [[Ironbridge Gorge]] and [[The Wrekin]] are both pleasant walks from Dawley.\n\nOn the northern edge of Dawley is [[Malinslee]] where [http://stleonard.wordpress.com St. Leonards] church stands.\nThe design of St. Leonards, a slightly irregular octagon, is said to have been influenced by Thomas Telford.\nOther churches supposedly influenced by [[Thomas Telford]] during his work in Shropshire are at nearby [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Bridgnorth]].\n[[Image:St leonards small.jpg|thumb|left|alt=St. Leonards Church Malinslee|St. Leonards Church Malinslee]]\n\n==Education==\nThere are seven primary schools in the Dawley area, and a comprehensive secondary school, [[Telford Langley School]].

Quebec Since 1930: A History. Pp. 521.</ref>\n\nThe Quebec Liberals have always been associated with the colour red; each of their main opponents in different eras have been generally associated with the colour blue.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Confederation===\nThe Liberal Party is descended from:\n# the [[Parti canadien]], or Parti Patriote who supported the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], and\n# the [[Parti rouge]], who fought for [[responsible government]] and against the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Lower Canada]].\nThe most notable figure of this period was [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]].\n\n===Post-Confederation===\nThe Liberals were in opposition to the ruling Conservatives for most of the first 20 years after [[Canadian Confederation]], except for 18 months of Liberal [[minority government]] in 1878-1879.  However, the situation changed in 1885 when the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government executed [[Louis Riel]], the leader of the French-speaking [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people of western Canada.  This decision was unpopular in Quebec. [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier]] rode this wave of discontent to power in 1887, but was brought down by a scandal in 1891. He was later cleared of all charges.  The Conservatives returned to power until 1897.\n\n[[File:Gouvernement Marchand 1897.jpg|thumb|Members of the 1897 [[F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand|Marchand]] government.]]\nThe Liberals won the [[1897 Quebec general election|1897 election]], and held power without interruption for the next 39 years; the Conservatives never held power in Qu\u00e9bec again.  This mirrored the situation in Ottawa, where the arrival of [[Wilfrid Laurier]] in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 federal election]] marked the beginning of [[Liberal Party of Canada]] dominance at the federal level.  Notable long-serving [[Premiers of Quebec]] in this era were [[Lomer Gouin]] and [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]].\n\nBy 1935, however, the Conservatives had an ambitious new leader, [[Maurice Duplessis]]. Duplessis merged his party with dissident ex-Liberals who had formed the [[Action lib\u00e9rale nationale]].  Duplessis led the new party, the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] (UN), to power in the [[1936 Quebec general election|1936 election]].  The Liberals returned to power in the [[1939 Quebec general election|1939 election]], but lost it again in the [[1944 Quebec general election|1944 election]]. They remained in opposition to the Union Nationale until one year after Duplessis's death in 1959.\n\nIn 1955, the PLQ severed its affiliation with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].\n\n===Post-1960===\nUnder [[Jean Lesage]], the party won an [[1960 Quebec general election|historic election in 1960]], ending sixteen years of rule by the national-conservative Union Nationale.  This marked the beginning of the [[Quiet Revolution]], which dramatically changed Qu\u00e9bec society.  Under the slogans ''C'est l'temps qu'\u00e7a change'' (it's time for change) in 1960 and ''ma\u00eetres chez nous'' (masters in our own house) in 1962, the Quebec government undertook several major initiatives, including:\n\n* full [[nationalization]] of the electricity industry through merger of 11 private companies with the government-owned [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]]&nbsp;\u2014 this major initiative of the government was led by the minister of natural resources, [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], in 1963;\n* creation of a public [[pension]] plan, the [[R\u00e9gie des rentes du Qu\u00e9bec]] (QPP/RRQ), separate from the [[Canada Pension Plan]] that exists in all other provinces of Canada, and creation of [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ);\n* elimination of tuition fees for public elementary & secondary schools and creation of the [[Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00e9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec]];\n* secularisation of schools and hospitals;\n* creation of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de financement]] (SGF);\n* creation of the first incarnation of [[Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise]] (OQLF, originally OLF);\n* mandatory call for bids for all public works contracts above 25000 $ ([[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] 1960);\n* creation of Obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Qu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec savings bonds) in 1963;\n* right to strike in public service (1964);\n* creation of an office in Paris, introduction of the G\u00e9rin-Lajoie doctrine (meaning that Qu\u00e9bec has rights to its own international presence matching its domestic range of jurisdiction).\n\n[[File:Assembl\u00e9e nationale - Statue Jean Lesage1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Jean Lesage in front of the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]].]]\nUnder Lesage, the Liberals developed a [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] wing.

The proposal was rejected and, as a result, some Liberals, including senior [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] minister L\u00e9vesque, left the Liberals to join the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty movement]], participating in the founding of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (PQ) under L\u00e9vesque's leadership.<ref name=a/>\n\nRelations soured between the Quebec Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party under Lesage, and worsened further under [[Robert Bourassa]] who had a poor relationship with [[Pierre Trudeau]].\n\n[[1970 Quebec general election|First elected in 1970]], Robert Bourassa instituted Bill 22 to introduce [[French language]] as the official language in Quebec, and pushed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] for [[Canadian constitution|constitutional]] concessions. [[1973 Quebec general election|Reelected in 1973]], his government was also embarrassed by several scandals. Bourassa resigned from the party's leadership after the loss of the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 election]] to Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nBourassa was succeeded as Liberal leader by [[Claude Ryan]], the former director of the respected Montr\u00e9al newspaper, ''[[Le Devoir]]''. Ryan led the successful federalist campaign in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, but then lost the [[1981 Quebec general election|1981 election]].  He resigned as Liberal leader some time later, paving the way for the return of Robert Bourassa.\n\nWhen Bourassa [[1985 Quebec general election|returned as Premier in 1985]], he successfully persuaded the federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Brian Mulroney]] to recognize Quebec as a [[distinct society]], and sought greater powers for Quebec and the other provinces.  This resulted in the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown constitutional accords]]. Both of these proposals, however, were not ratified. While a [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]], Bourassa remained an opponent of independence for Quebec.\n\n[[Daniel Johnson, Jr.]] succeeded Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier of Qu\u00e9bec in 1994, but soon lost the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 election]] to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois under [[Jacques Parizeau]].\n\nIn 1993, after the failure of the Charlottetown Accord, many nationalist members of the Liberal party led by [[Jean Allaire]] and [[Mario Dumont]], including many from the party's youth wing, left to form the [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]] (ADQ) because the Liberal Party dropped most of its [[Allaire Report|autonomist demands]] during the negotiation of the Charlottetown Accord. As in 1980, the PLQ campaigned successfully for a \"no\" vote in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]] on sovereignty.\n\n===Modern era===\nThe contemporary Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party is a [[big tent|broad-based]] federalist coalition including among its members some supporters of the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]].

Premier [[Jean Charest]] was a federal cabinet minister with the now-defunct [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] including a stint as Deputy Prime Minister and even serving as its leader for a time. The QLP government proposed a policy of reform of social programs and cuts to government spending and the [[civil service]], and established a controversial health system fee for all taxpayers.\n\nIt has also softened language policies. For example, in response to a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision overruling a loophole-closing stopgap measure enacted by the [[Bernard Landry]] government, the Liberals enacted Loi 104 which provides for English-language, unsubsidized private school students to transfer into the subsidized English-language system, thus receiving the right to attend English schools in Qu\u00e9bec for their siblings and all descendants, should the student demonstrate a bureaucratically-defined ''parcours authentique'' within the English system. Meanwhile, the [[Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise]] (Quebec Board of the French Language) under the Liberal provincial government has also opted for a demand-side strategy for the enforcement of language laws, using a number of publicity campaigns, including stickers which merchants may voluntarily affix on their shop windows stating that French service may be obtained within, allowing for consumers to \"choose\" stores which will serve them in French.\n\nThe Liberal party suffered a major setback in the [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 election]], which saw them reduced to a [[minority government]], having lost francophone support to the surging [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|ADQ]].<ref name=\"Liberals' identity crisis\">{{cite web |last=Gazette |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=ed4f5ebb-fc08-4a91-95af-49154a128aba |title=Liberals' identity crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-09-18 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106000230/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=ed4f5ebb-fc08-4a91-95af-49154a128aba |archivedate=2012-11-06 }}</ref> However, the party regained a majority in the [[2008 Quebec general election|2008 election]], which saw the collapse of ADQ support and the return of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as the main opposition party.

This move proved controversial, leading to a [[2012 Quebec student protests|significant portion of Quebec post-secondary students striking]] against the measures. In response to the discord the Quebec Liberal government introduced controversial emergency legislation via [[Bill 78]] that restricted student protest activities, attacking students' right to strike and to demonstrate peacefully, and dealt with the administrative issues resulting from so many students missing classes.\n\nAfter almost a decade in power, the Liberal government of Jean Charest was defeated in the [[2012 Quebec general election|2012 provincial election]] by the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] led by [[Pauline Marois]].

Quebec Since 1930: A History. Pp. 521.</ref>\n\nThe Quebec Liberals have always been associated with the colour red; each of their main opponents in different eras have been generally associated with the colour blue.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Confederation===\nThe Liberal Party is descended from:\n# the [[Parti canadien]], or Parti Patriote who supported the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], and\n# the [[Parti rouge]], who fought for [[responsible government]] and against the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Lower Canada]].\nThe most notable figure of this period was [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]].\n\n===Post-Confederation===\nThe Liberals were in opposition to the ruling Conservatives for most of the first 20 years after [[Canadian Confederation]], except for 18 months of Liberal [[minority government]] in 1878-1879.  However, the situation changed in 1885 when the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government executed [[Louis Riel]], the leader of the French-speaking [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people of western Canada.  This decision was unpopular in Quebec. [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier]] rode this wave of discontent to power in 1887, but was brought down by a scandal in 1891. He was later cleared of all charges.  The Conservatives returned to power until 1897.\n\n[[File:Gouvernement Marchand 1897.jpg|thumb|Members of the 1897 [[F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand|Marchand]] government.]]\nThe Liberals won the [[1897 Quebec general election|1897 election]], and held power without interruption for the next 39 years; the Conservatives never held power in Qu\u00e9bec again.  This mirrored the situation in Ottawa, where the arrival of [[Wilfrid Laurier]] in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 federal election]] marked the beginning of [[Liberal Party of Canada]] dominance at the federal level.  Notable long-serving [[Premiers of Quebec]] in this era were [[Lomer Gouin]] and [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]].\n\nBy 1935, however, the Conservatives had an ambitious new leader, [[Maurice Duplessis]]. Duplessis merged his party with dissident ex-Liberals who had formed the [[Action lib\u00e9rale nationale]].  Duplessis led the new party, the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] (UN), to power in the [[1936 Quebec general election|1936 election]].  The Liberals returned to power in the [[1939 Quebec general election|1939 election]], but lost it again in the [[1944 Quebec general election|1944 election]]. They remained in opposition to the Union Nationale until one year after Duplessis's death in 1959.\n\nIn 1955, the PLQ severed its affiliation with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].\n\n===Post-1960===\nUnder [[Jean Lesage]], the party won an [[1960 Quebec general election|historic election in 1960]], ending sixteen years of rule by the national-conservative Union Nationale.  This marked the beginning of the [[Quiet Revolution]], which dramatically changed Qu\u00e9bec society.  Under the slogans ''C'est l'temps qu'\u00e7a change'' (it's time for change) in 1960 and ''ma\u00eetres chez nous'' (masters in our own house) in 1962, the Quebec government undertook several major initiatives, including:\n\n* full [[nationalization]] of the electricity industry through merger of 11 private companies with the government-owned [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]]&nbsp;\u2014 this major initiative of the government was led by the minister of natural resources, [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], in 1963;\n* creation of a public [[pension]] plan, the [[R\u00e9gie des rentes du Qu\u00e9bec]] (QPP/RRQ), separate from the [[Canada Pension Plan]] that exists in all other provinces of Canada, and creation of [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ);\n* elimination of tuition fees for public elementary & secondary schools and creation of the [[Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00e9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec]];\n* secularisation of schools and hospitals;\n* creation of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de financement]] (SGF);\n* creation of the first incarnation of [[Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise]] (OQLF, originally OLF);\n* mandatory call for bids for all public works contracts above 25000 $ ([[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] 1960);\n* creation of Obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Qu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec savings bonds) in 1963;\n* right to strike in public service (1964);\n* creation of an office in Paris, introduction of the G\u00e9rin-Lajoie doctrine (meaning that Qu\u00e9bec has rights to its own international presence matching its domestic range of jurisdiction).\n\n[[File:Assembl\u00e9e nationale - Statue Jean Lesage1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Jean Lesage in front of the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]].]]\nUnder Lesage, the Liberals developed a [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] wing. In July 1964, the Quebec Liberal Federation led by Lesage formally disaffiliated from the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada]] making the Quebec Liberal Party a distinct organization from its federal counterpart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wcMtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iJ8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4248,6415337&dq=liberal-federation%20canada%20president&hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=a>{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Garth|title=Community Besieged: The Anglophone Minority and the Politics of Quebec|year=1999|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773518391|page=[https://archive.org/details/communitybesiege0000stev/page/79 79]|url=https://archive.org/details/communitybesiege0000stev|url-access=registration|quote=quebec anglophone ridings.}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1967, former cabinet minister [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]'s proposed that the party endorse his plan for [[sovereignty association]]. The proposal was rejected and, as a result, some Liberals, including senior [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] minister L\u00e9vesque, left the Liberals to join the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty movement]], participating in the founding of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (PQ) under L\u00e9vesque's leadership.<ref name=a/>\n\nRelations soured between the Quebec Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party under Lesage, and worsened further under [[Robert Bourassa]] who had a poor relationship with [[Pierre Trudeau]].\n\n[[1970 Quebec general election|First elected in 1970]], Robert Bourassa instituted Bill 22 to introduce [[French language]] as the official language in Quebec, and pushed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] for [[Canadian constitution|constitutional]] concessions. [[1973 Quebec general election|Reelected in 1973]], his government was also embarrassed by several scandals. Bourassa resigned from the party's leadership after the loss of the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 election]] to Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nBourassa was succeeded as Liberal leader by [[Claude Ryan]], the former director of the respected Montr\u00e9al newspaper, ''[[Le Devoir]]''. Ryan led the successful federalist campaign in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, but then lost the [[1981 Quebec general election|1981 election]].  He resigned as Liberal leader some time later, paving the way for the return of Robert Bourassa.\n\nWhen Bourassa [[1985 Quebec general election|returned as Premier in 1985]], he successfully persuaded the federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Brian Mulroney]] to recognize Quebec as a [[distinct society]], and sought greater powers for Quebec and the other provinces.  This resulted in the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown constitutional accords]]. Both of these proposals, however, were not ratified. While a [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]], Bourassa remained an opponent of independence for Quebec.\n\n[[Daniel Johnson, Jr.]] succeeded Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier of Qu\u00e9bec in 1994, but soon lost the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 election]] to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois under [[Jacques Parizeau]].\n\nIn 1993, after the failure of the Charlottetown Accord, many nationalist members of the Liberal party led by [[Jean Allaire]] and [[Mario Dumont]], including many from the party's youth wing, left to form the [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]] (ADQ) because the Liberal Party dropped most of its [[Allaire Report|autonomist demands]] during the negotiation of the Charlottetown Accord. As in 1980, the PLQ campaigned successfully for a \"no\" vote in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]] on sovereignty.\n\n===Modern era===\nThe contemporary Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party is a [[big tent|broad-based]] federalist coalition including among its members some supporters of the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. In terms of voter support, it has always been able to rely on the great majority of non-[[francophone]]s in Qu\u00e9bec.<ref>{{cite web |work=The Gazette |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=8f51f810-3eec-40a3-9b6b-d3593a931392&p=2 |title=Firing of aides won't save Charest for long |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-09-08 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106002140/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=8f51f810-3eec-40a3-9b6b-d3593a931392&p=2 |archivedate=2012-11-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe Liberals regained power in the [[2003 Quebec general election|2003 election]]. Premier [[Jean Charest]] was a federal cabinet minister with the now-defunct [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] including a stint as Deputy Prime Minister and even serving as its leader for a time. The QLP government proposed a policy of reform of social programs and cuts to government spending and the [[civil service]], and established a controversial health system fee for all taxpayers.\n\nIt has also softened language policies. For example, in response to a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision overruling a loophole-closing stopgap measure enacted by the [[Bernard Landry]] government, the Liberals enacted Loi 104 which provides for English-language, unsubsidized private school students to transfer into the subsidized English-language system, thus receiving the right to attend English schools in Qu\u00e9bec for their siblings and all descendants, should the student demonstrate a bureaucratically-defined ''parcours authentique'' within the English system. Meanwhile, the [[Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise]] (Quebec Board of the French Language) under the Liberal provincial government has also opted for a demand-side strategy for the enforcement of language laws, using a number of publicity campaigns, including stickers which merchants may voluntarily affix on their shop windows stating that French service may be obtained within, allowing for consumers to \"choose\" stores which will serve them in French.\n\nThe Liberal party suffered a major setback in the [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 election]], which saw them reduced to a [[minority government]], having lost francophone support to the surging [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|ADQ]].<ref name=\"Liberals' identity crisis\">{{cite web |last=Gazette |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=ed4f5ebb-fc08-4a91-95af-49154a128aba |title=Liberals' identity crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-09-18 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106000230/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=ed4f5ebb-fc08-4a91-95af-49154a128aba |archivedate=2012-11-06 }}</ref> However, the party regained a majority in the [[2008 Quebec general election|2008 election]], which saw the collapse of ADQ support and the return of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as the main opposition party.

After public pressure, the Liberal government eventually called for a public commission of inquiry.

This move proved controversial, leading to a [[2012 Quebec student protests|significant portion of Quebec post-secondary students striking]] against the measures. In response to the discord the Quebec Liberal government introduced controversial emergency legislation via [[Bill 78]] that restricted student protest activities, attacking students' right to strike and to demonstrate peacefully, and dealt with the administrative issues resulting from so many students missing classes.\n\nAfter almost a decade in power, the Liberal government of Jean Charest was defeated in the [[2012 Quebec general election|2012 provincial election]] by the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] led by [[Pauline Marois]].

They had 11 children.<ref>Australian Dictionary of Biography Online</ref> The first wave of free Hellenic migrants commenced in the 1850s, and continued through the end of the 19th century, prompted in part by the recent discovery of gold in the country.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Appleyard | first1=Reginald | last2=Yiannakis | first2=John N. | title=Greek Pioneers in Western Australia | publisher=UWA Publishing | year=2002 | page=27}}</ref> A young Greek immigrant born in Athens, Greece named Georgios Tramountanas (1822 \u2013 29 January 1911) and anglicised as George North in 1858, was the first settler of Greek origin in South Australia in 1842. The Greek community of South Australia regards North (Tramountanas) as their Pioneering Grandfather. In 1901, the year of federation, the Australian census recorded 878 native Greeks that were born there (In Greece), now living in Australia. Many of these Greeks were owners of or were employed in shops and restaurants. Some were also cane-cutters in Queensland.\n\n===20th century Greek Immigration to Australia===\nFrom the last decade of the 19th century until WWI the number of Greeks immigrating to Australia increased steadily and Hellenic communities were reasonably well established in Melbourne and Sydney at this time. The Greek language press had begun in Australia and in 1913, Australia had the first Greek weekly newspaper that was published in Melbourne. During WWI Greece remained neutral, eventually joining the side of the Allies. In 1916 the Australian government responded to this by placing a special prohibition on the entry of Greeks and Maltese people to Australia that was not lifted until 1920. There were a number of [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Greek]] outbursts as a result of the neutrality stance by Greece, often instigated by Australian soldiers on leave. During these outbursts Greek shops and [[Greek caf\u00e9 culture in Australia|Greek caf\u00e9s]] were badly damaged or destroyed, with the worst rioting occurring in [[Kalgoorlie]] and Boulder.\n\nDuring the 1920s, as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] there was a significant amount of Greek migration to Darwin and across the Top End. Greeks often worked in the canefields in North Queensland and move to Darwin during the dry season to work in the pearling industry. One famous family of Greek Australians, the [[Paspaley]] family from the island of [[Kastellorizo]], excelled in the Pearling industry and have stores across Australia with their main store being in Darwin. It is noted that the first major flow of Greek immigrants to Australia began in the mid 1920s, where a large number of Greek people from Kastellorizo migrated to Australia to escape the Ottoman repression. A large number of these people from Greece's easternmost island spent time in Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, before being offered migration to Australia by British authorities. Those of Kastellorizian descent living in Australia now refer to themselves as 'Kazzies,' and have maintained a strong and unique community.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the number of Greeks migrating to Australia increased substantially. Some Greeks who settled in Australia were expelled from Asia Minor after the Greek military defeat and the mass genocide by Turkey in 1922 while other Greeks sought entry after the USA established restrictive immigration quotas in the early 1920s. From 1924 until 1936 a series of regulations operating in Australia severely restricted the number of Greeks permitted to immigrate to and settle in Australia.\n\nGreece entered WWII with the Allies when she was invaded by German and Italian forces who remained in Greece until 1944. Many ANZACs went to the nation and tried to help the population to defeat the Axis enemy only to be saved themselves by the locals, building a relationship between Australians and Greeks that stands strong to this day. When troops withdrew a struggle broke out between pro and anti-communist factions which resulted in civil war between 1946 and 1949, ending with the defeat of the communists.\n\nThe Greek government, devastated by the destruction of infrastructure and the looting of their banks by the Germans, encouraged post-war migration as a way of solving poverty and unemployment problems. Post WWII in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, Greeks were among one of the main European races picked by the Australian government's \"[[Populate or perish]]\" immigration scheme and due to this, thousands of Greeks migrated to Australia with just one purpose and that was to gain a better life and future for themselves and their families. The main destinations where these \"Hellenes\" immigrated were to cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. During these decades, the Greeks started making an impact in the country like never before, they were not only still establishing their own restaurants, this time they were also establishing their own Hellenic Community Clubs and Greek-Australian Soccer clubs. Greeks along with Italians, Croatians, Maltese, Serbians, Jews, Hungarians, Czechs, etc. really marked a milestone on Australian sport in general by forming some of the greatest and most successful Association football clubs that Australian football has ever had{{peacock term|date=April 2016}} and in the Greek communities case, the most successful Australian clubs with Greek heritage and culture are the inventions of South Melbourne Hellas ([[South Melbourne FC]]) founded in 1959, Alexander the Great ([[Heidelberg United FC]]) founded in 1958, Pan-Hellenic ([[Sydney Olympic FC]]) founded in 1957 and West Adelaide Hellas ([[West Adelaide SC]]) founded in 1962. All three clubs were founded by Greek immigrants that immigrated to those respective cities. Since then, the rest of the 20th century from 1970 to 1999, Greek immigration to Australia very much declined and Greek immigrants were very few and not many of them came to settle in Australia during the rest of the century. The main way the Greek population was increasing greatly during this time was through the birth of either full, half or part Australian-born Greek descendants who are children (2nd generation) and grandchildren (3rd generation) of the Greek immigrants who came in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. However, Hellenic/Greek immigration has increased in the last few years due to the severe economic crisis overseas.\n\nAfter the changes in Greece from the mid 1970s, including the fall of the [[Georgios Papadopoulos|Papadopoulos]] regime in 1974 and the formal inclusion of Greece into the [[European Union]], Greek immigration to Australia has slowed since the 1971 peak of 160,200 arrivals. Within Australia, the Greek immigrants have been \"extremely well organised socially and politically\", with approximately 600 Greek organisations in the country by 1973, and immigrants have strived to maintain their faith and cultural identity.<ref>Keays, Sue (2004). \"[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/640/1/keays_sue.pdf Yassou, Souvlakia and Paniyiri: Adapting Greek Culture for Australians]\".

However, in the years 2000\u20132009, many Greek-Australians both native Greek and Australian-born, returned to Greece to discover their homeland and reconnect with their ancestral roots. Yet, as the economic crisis in Greece grew, the opportunities for temporary resident Greek Australians abroad were limited. For this reason many Greek Australians have shortened their planned long term stays in Greece and have returned home to Australia.\n\nIn the early 2010s there has been an increase of Greek immigration flows to Australia due to unemployment, among other issues, because of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic crisis in Greece]]. This has led to the return of many Greek Australians which had gone to Greece before the crisis and also the arrival of newcomers from Greece, who have been received by the large Greek Australian community mainly in [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/new-greek-wave-hits-australia27s-shores/5017474 |author=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |title=Greek-Australian citizens look to Australia to escape economic crisis |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Greeks by state or territory===\n{{See also|Greek community of Melbourne}}\nThe largest concentration of Greeks in Australia is in the [[Victoria (Australia)|state of Victoria]], which is often regarded as the heartland of the Greek Australian community.

Greek Australians, as with other [[European Australians]], have contributed much to the society of Australia as the past generations' choice to pursue a better life have given the first generation of Greek Australians an opportunity to create a better future and career in their nation of birth.

Though eventually pardoned, two of those seven Greeks stayed and settled in the country. One settled on the Monaro Plains in Southern New South Wales and one at Picton near Sydney. Their names were Ghikas Bulgaris known as Jigger Bulgari, and Andonis Manolis. Jigger Bulgari married a local woman, and they had many children. Jigger was buried at Nimmitabel Pioneer Cemetery. The Hellenic Club of Canberra laid a commemorative marble plaque over his resting place around 2000. Andonis Manolis' grave is in the old cemetery at Mittagong.

They had 11 children.<ref>Australian Dictionary of Biography Online</ref> The first wave of free Hellenic migrants commenced in the 1850s, and continued through the end of the 19th century, prompted in part by the recent discovery of gold in the country.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Appleyard | first1=Reginald | last2=Yiannakis | first2=John N. | title=Greek Pioneers in Western Australia | publisher=UWA Publishing | year=2002 | page=27}}</ref> A young Greek immigrant born in Athens, Greece named Georgios Tramountanas (1822 \u2013 29 January 1911) and anglicised as George North in 1858, was the first settler of Greek origin in South Australia in 1842. The Greek community of South Australia regards North (Tramountanas) as their Pioneering Grandfather. In 1901, the year of federation, the Australian census recorded 878 native Greeks that were born there (In Greece), now living in Australia. Many of these Greeks were owners of or were employed in shops and restaurants. Some were also cane-cutters in Queensland.\n\n===20th century Greek Immigration to Australia===\nFrom the last decade of the 19th century until WWI the number of Greeks immigrating to Australia increased steadily and Hellenic communities were reasonably well established in Melbourne and Sydney at this time. The Greek language press had begun in Australia and in 1913, Australia had the first Greek weekly newspaper that was published in Melbourne. During WWI Greece remained neutral, eventually joining the side of the Allies. In 1916 the Australian government responded to this by placing a special prohibition on the entry of Greeks and Maltese people to Australia that was not lifted until 1920. There were a number of [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Greek]] outbursts as a result of the neutrality stance by Greece, often instigated by Australian soldiers on leave. During these outbursts Greek shops and [[Greek caf\u00e9 culture in Australia|Greek caf\u00e9s]] were badly damaged or destroyed, with the worst rioting occurring in [[Kalgoorlie]] and Boulder.\n\nDuring the 1920s, as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] there was a significant amount of Greek migration to Darwin and across the Top End. Greeks often worked in the canefields in North Queensland and move to Darwin during the dry season to work in the pearling industry. One famous family of Greek Australians, the [[Paspaley]] family from the island of [[Kastellorizo]], excelled in the Pearling industry and have stores across Australia with their main store being in Darwin. It is noted that the first major flow of Greek immigrants to Australia began in the mid 1920s, where a large number of Greek people from Kastellorizo migrated to Australia to escape the Ottoman repression. A large number of these people from Greece's easternmost island spent time in Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, before being offered migration to Australia by British authorities. Those of Kastellorizian descent living in Australia now refer to themselves as 'Kazzies,' and have maintained a strong and unique community.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the number of Greeks migrating to Australia increased substantially. Some Greeks who settled in Australia were expelled from Asia Minor after the Greek military defeat and the mass genocide by Turkey in 1922 while other Greeks sought entry after the USA established restrictive immigration quotas in the early 1920s. From 1924 until 1936 a series of regulations operating in Australia severely restricted the number of Greeks permitted to immigrate to and settle in Australia.\n\nGreece entered WWII with the Allies when she was invaded by German and Italian forces who remained in Greece until 1944. Many ANZACs went to the nation and tried to help the population to defeat the Axis enemy only to be saved themselves by the locals, building a relationship between Australians and Greeks that stands strong to this day. When troops withdrew a struggle broke out between pro and anti-communist factions which resulted in civil war between 1946 and 1949, ending with the defeat of the communists.\n\nThe Greek government, devastated by the destruction of infrastructure and the looting of their banks by the Germans, encouraged post-war migration as a way of solving poverty and unemployment problems. Post WWII in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, Greeks were among one of the main European races picked by the Australian government's \"[[Populate or perish]]\" immigration scheme and due to this, thousands of Greeks migrated to Australia with just one purpose and that was to gain a better life and future for themselves and their families. The main destinations where these \"Hellenes\" immigrated were to cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. During these decades, the Greeks started making an impact in the country like never before, they were not only still establishing their own restaurants, this time they were also establishing their own Hellenic Community Clubs and Greek-Australian Soccer clubs. Greeks along with Italians, Croatians, Maltese, Serbians, Jews, Hungarians, Czechs, etc. really marked a milestone on Australian sport in general by forming some of the greatest and most successful Association football clubs that Australian football has ever had{{peacock term|date=April 2016}} and in the Greek communities case, the most successful Australian clubs with Greek heritage and culture are the inventions of South Melbourne Hellas ([[South Melbourne FC]]) founded in 1959, Alexander the Great ([[Heidelberg United FC]]) founded in 1958, Pan-Hellenic ([[Sydney Olympic FC]]) founded in 1957 and West Adelaide Hellas ([[West Adelaide SC]]) founded in 1962. All three clubs were founded by Greek immigrants that immigrated to those respective cities. Since then, the rest of the 20th century from 1970 to 1999, Greek immigration to Australia very much declined and Greek immigrants were very few and not many of them came to settle in Australia during the rest of the century. The main way the Greek population was increasing greatly during this time was through the birth of either full, half or part Australian-born Greek descendants who are children (2nd generation) and grandchildren (3rd generation) of the Greek immigrants who came in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. However, Hellenic/Greek immigration has increased in the last few years due to the severe economic crisis overseas.\n\nAfter the changes in Greece from the mid 1970s, including the fall of the [[Georgios Papadopoulos|Papadopoulos]] regime in 1974 and the formal inclusion of Greece into the [[European Union]], Greek immigration to Australia has slowed since the 1971 peak of 160,200 arrivals. Within Australia, the Greek immigrants have been \"extremely well organised socially and politically\", with approximately 600 Greek organisations in the country by 1973, and immigrants have strived to maintain their faith and cultural identity.<ref>Keays, Sue (2004). \"[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/640/1/keays_sue.pdf Yassou, Souvlakia and Paniyiri: Adapting Greek Culture for Australians]\".

However, in the years 2000\u20132009, many Greek-Australians both native Greek and Australian-born, returned to Greece to discover their homeland and reconnect with their ancestral roots. Yet, as the economic crisis in Greece grew, the opportunities for temporary resident Greek Australians abroad were limited. For this reason many Greek Australians have shortened their planned long term stays in Greece and have returned home to Australia.\n\nIn the early 2010s there has been an increase of Greek immigration flows to Australia due to unemployment, among other issues, because of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic crisis in Greece]]. This has led to the return of many Greek Australians which had gone to Greece before the crisis and also the arrival of newcomers from Greece, who have been received by the large Greek Australian community mainly in [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/new-greek-wave-hits-australia27s-shores/5017474 |author=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |title=Greek-Australian citizens look to Australia to escape economic crisis |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Greeks by state or territory===\n{{See also|Greek community of Melbourne}}\nThe largest concentration of Greeks in Australia is in the [[Victoria (Australia)|state of Victoria]], which is often regarded as the heartland of the Greek Australian community.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''He said: \u201cI am leaving now\u201d'' versus ''He said (that) he was leaving immediately''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The medication prescribed by Dr Fox does not include those that would require a face to face consultation,<ref>{{cite web|title=The doctor won't see you now: online consulting and prescribing  |publisher= mHealth insight |url=http://mhealthinsight.com/2012/11/01/bmj-the-doctor-wont-see-you-now-online-consulting-and-prescribing/  |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> neither do they include any medicines that could be addictive or abused, such as painkillers.\n\nThis model of consultation falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Care Quality Commission]], which regulates all private practitioners of medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=British patients click online to see the doctor  |publisher= The Washington Times |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/aug/6/british-patients-click-online-to-see-doctor/?page=3  |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\nThe UK online pharmacy market has been subject to official regulation since the first legal online pharmacy was set up in 2002. In 2005 changes to the [[National Health Service]] regulation made it legal for online pharmacies to fill out NHS prescriptions over the internet. In general, online pharmacies in the UK are subject to the same statutory regulation that traditional pharmacies are under. Many have a Care Quality Commission registration number. They comply with the [[Health and Social Care Act 2008]] and [[GPhC]] regulations. In 2008 the [[RPSGB]] introduced a specially designed green cross logo so that customers could easily identify online pharmacies that had been accredited by the organisation. In 2010 this logo scheme was passed on to the GPhC.<ref>{{cite web|title=GPhC Registration Number  |publisher= General Pharmaceutical Council |url=http://pharmacyregulation.org/registers/pharmacy/registrationnumber/1042367  |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.doctorfox.co.uk/ Official website]\n\n[[Category:Pharmacies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 2010]]\n[[Category:2010 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bristol]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Online pharmacies]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:caca:5e00:e87d:899f:db2c:8c24", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Fox_Pharmacy"}
