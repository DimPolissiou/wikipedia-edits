Milan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Inter===\nIn 1996, Ajax sold Kanu to [[Serie A]] side [[Inter Milan]] for around $4.7 million. That summer he captained the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian team]] that won gold at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], and scored two late goals in the semi-finals against powerhouses Brazil to overturn a 2\u20133 scoreline into a 4\u20133 win in extra time. Kanu was also named [[African Footballer of the Year]] for that year.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2017/08/22/nwankwo-kanu-and-the-languid-brilliance-of-nigerias-most-celebrated-footballer/|title=NWANKWO KANU AND THE LANGUID BRILLIANCE OF NIGERIA\u2019S MOST CELEBRATED FOOTBALLER|website=These Football Times.co}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreamteamfc.com/c/news-gossip/272427/nwankow-kanu-ronaldo-1996-olympics/|title=GOLD|website=Dream Team FC.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, soon after returning from the Olympics, Kanu underwent a medical examination at Inter, which revealed a serious [[heart]] defect; he underwent surgery in November 1996 to replace an [[aortic valve]] and did not return to his club until April 1997. In interviews, Kanu frequently cites his faith as a Christian,<ref>{{Cite news| last = Wilson| first = Jeremy| title = Portsmouth thrive on power of prayer and goals from born-again Kanu| url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,1934705,00.html| publisher = The Guardian| date = 30 October 2006| accessdate = 11 March 2008}}</ref> and has often mentioned this trying time of his career as an occasion when he prayed to God. Kanu's experience also led to his founding the Kanu Heart Foundation, an organisation that helps predominantly young African children who suffer heart defects and whose work was expanded to provide aid for homeless children in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Okeleji |first=Oluwashina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7485713.stm |title=Kanu to tackle homeless problem |website=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nIn February 1999, after just twelve games and one goal for Inter, Kanu was signed by Arsenal for approximately \u00a34.15 million. He made his debut for Arsenal, against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[FA Cup]]. With the score 1\u20131 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper [[Alan Kelly, Jr.|Alan Kelly]] kicked the ball out of touch so that treatment could be given to [[Lee Morris (footballer)|Lee Morris]]. When the ball was thrown back into play by [[Ray Parlour]], although it was intended for Kelly, Kanu chased the throw-in down the right wing unchallenged and centered the ball for [[Marc Overmars]], who scored to make the match 2\u20131. After the match, Arsenal manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] accepted that it was not correct sportsmanship and offered to re-play the match<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HfxOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xhQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5223,4037100&dq=arsenal+sheffield+fa+cup&hl=en |title=Sport-wise it's not right |publisher=New Straits Times |date=15 February 1999 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> which was again won by Arsenal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw |first=Phil |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-overmars-seals-action-replay-1072977.html |title=Football: Overmars seals action replay \u2013 Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=24 February 1999 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the events overshadowing his debut, Kanu's career was quickly revived at Arsenal.

In the [[1999\u20132000 FA Premier League|1999\u20132000 season]] he scored 17 times in 50 matches for the Gunners, including a hat-trick in fifteen minutes against Chelsea to turn a 2\u20130 deficit into a 3\u20132 victory. In August 2001, Arsenal rejected a bid from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] of around \u00a37m for Kanu.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Arsenal reject Kanu bid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1492347.stm|website=BBC Sport|date=15 August 2001|accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref> However, Kanu's appearances for Arsenal gradually became less frequent, particularly after the emergence of [[Thierry Henry]] as Arsenal's first choice striker with Kanu being mainly used as a substitute. Kanu then won the 2003 [[FA Cup]] with Arsenal.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|4049|2003|name=Nwankwo Kanu|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref> Along with other famous players, such as Henry and [[Robert Pires]], Kanu is a member of the \"Invincibles\", the Arsenal side that finished the [[2003\u201304 Premier League|2003\u201304 season of the Premier League]] undefeated. He played 197 games for Arsenal, scoring 44 goals. In the summer of 2004, after his contract with Arsenal ended, he moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer. In 2008, Kanu was voted 13th in the \"Gunners' Greatest 50 Players\" poll.<ref name=\"greatest50\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-13.-kanu|title=Gunners' Greatest Players \u2013 13.

The game was tied 1\u20131 when Kanu scored the winning goal, making him the third person to score in the stadium.

Kanu started as a regular for the club, making his debut in a 1\u20131 draw away at Blackburn Rovers on 14 August 2004. He scored his first goal for Albion on 18 September 2004, an 88th-minute equalizer in a 1\u20131 home draw against Fulham. In a match against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 14 November 2004, Kanu was guilty of an incredible miss in injury time, with Albion 2\u20131 down. Kanu had sent a low cross over the bar from a yard away from the goal line. Manager [[Bryan Robson]] was seen in TV footage mouthing the words \"How did he miss that?\", and Kanu's howler was crowned \"Miss of the Season\" by many media outlets in their end-of-season reviews. Nevertheless, the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season was ultimately a memorable one for West Brom, as they became the first club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being bottom of the table at Christmas.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOne of the most memorable games of the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season for Kanu came with the visit of his former club Arsenal to [[The Hawthorns]] on 15 October 2005. [[Philippe Senderos]] put the visitors ahead in the 17th minute, but Kanu equalised shortly before half time. West Brom went on to win the match 2\u20131 with a spectacular strike from [[Darren Carter]].

After a notable performance at the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup|U-17 World Championships]] he was signed by Dutch [[Eredivisie]] [[AFC Ajax]] in 1993 for an undisclosed fee. He made his Ajax debut that year and went on to score 25 goals in 54 appearances. Kanu also came on as a sub in Ajax's 1995 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final win over [[A.C. Milan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Inter===\nIn 1996, Ajax sold Kanu to [[Serie A]] side [[Inter Milan]] for around $4.7 million. That summer he captained the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian team]] that won gold at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], and scored two late goals in the semi-finals against powerhouses Brazil to overturn a 2\u20133 scoreline into a 4\u20133 win in extra time. Kanu was also named [[African Footballer of the Year]] for that year.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2017/08/22/nwankwo-kanu-and-the-languid-brilliance-of-nigerias-most-celebrated-footballer/|title=NWANKWO KANU AND THE LANGUID BRILLIANCE OF NIGERIA\u2019S MOST CELEBRATED FOOTBALLER|website=These Football Times.co}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreamteamfc.com/c/news-gossip/272427/nwankow-kanu-ronaldo-1996-olympics/|title=GOLD|website=Dream Team FC.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, soon after returning from the Olympics, Kanu underwent a medical examination at Inter, which revealed a serious [[heart]] defect; he underwent surgery in November 1996 to replace an [[aortic valve]] and did not return to his club until April 1997. In interviews, Kanu frequently cites his faith as a Christian,<ref>{{Cite news| last = Wilson| first = Jeremy| title = Portsmouth thrive on power of prayer and goals from born-again Kanu| url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,1934705,00.html| publisher = The Guardian| date = 30 October 2006| accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> and has often mentioned this trying time of his career as an occasion when he prayed to God. Kanu's experience also led to his founding the Kanu Heart Foundation, an organisation that helps predominantly young African children who suffer heart defects and whose work was expanded to provide aid for homeless children in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Okeleji |first=Oluwashina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7485713.stm |title=Kanu to tackle homeless problem |website=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nIn February 1999, after just twelve games and one goal for Inter, Kanu was signed by Arsenal for approximately \u00a34.15 million. He made his debut for Arsenal, against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[FA Cup]]. With the score 1\u20131 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper [[Alan Kelly, Jr.|Alan Kelly]] kicked the ball out of touch so that treatment could be given to [[Lee Morris (footballer)|Lee Morris]].

He played 197 games for Arsenal, scoring 44 goals. In the summer of 2004, after his contract with Arsenal ended, he moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer.

He scored his first goal for Albion on 18 September 2004, an 88th-minute equalizer in a 1\u20131 home draw against Fulham.

Kanu had sent a low cross over the bar from a yard away from the goal line. Manager [[Bryan Robson]] was seen in TV footage mouthing the words \"How did he miss that?\", and Kanu's howler was crowned \"Miss of the Season\" by many media outlets in their end-of-season reviews. Nevertheless, the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season was ultimately a memorable one for West Brom, as they became the first club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being bottom of the table at Christmas.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOne of the most memorable games of the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season for Kanu came with the visit of his former club Arsenal to [[The Hawthorns]] on 15 October 2005. [[Philippe Senderos]] put the visitors ahead in the 17th minute, but Kanu equalised shortly before half time.

These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total. In 2012 a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson in the book 'In Upp\u00e5ner med Lilla Lisen & Gamle Muppen'. ({{ISBN|978-91-7089-524-1}})\n\n==Identifying and resolving ambiguous images==\nMiddle vision is the stage in visual processing that combines all the basic features in the scene into distinct, recognizable object groups. This stage of vision comes before high-level vision (understanding the scene) and after early vision (determining the basic features of an image). When perceiving and recognizing images, mid-level vision comes into use when we need to classify the object we are seeing. Higher-level vision is used when the object classified must now be recognized as a specific member of its group. For example, through mid-level vision we perceive a face, then through high-level vision we recognize a face of a familiar person. Mid-level vision and high-level vision are crucial for understanding a reality that is filled with ambiguous perceptual inputs.<ref name=\"Wolfe\">Wolfe, J., Kluender, K., & Levi, D. (2009). Sensation and perception. (2 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.</ref>\n\n==Perceiving the image in mid-level vision==\nWhen we see an image, the first thing we do is attempt to organize all the parts of the scene into different groups.<ref name=\"halko\">Halko, M.A. Illusory contour and surface completion mechanisms in human visual cortex. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3303. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621754807</ref> To do this, one of the most basic methods used is finding the edges. Edges can include obvious perceptions such as the edge of a house, and can include other perceptions that the brain needs to process deeper, such as the edges of a person's facial features. When finding edges, the brain's visual system detects a point on the image with a sharp contrast of lighting. Being able to detect the location of the edge of an object aids in recognizing the object. In ambiguous images, detecting edges still seems natural to the person perceiving the image. However, the brain undergoes deeper processing to resolve the ambiguity. For example, consider an image that involves an opposite change in magnitude of luminance between the object and the background (e.g. From the top, the background shifts from black to white, and the object shifts from white to black). The opposing [[gradient]]s will eventually come to a point where there is an equal degree of luminance of the object and the background. At this point, there is no edge to be perceived. To counter this, the visual system connects the image as a whole rather than a set of edges, allowing one to see an object rather than edges and non-edges. Although there is no complete image to be seen, the brain is able to accomplish this because of its understanding of the physical world and real incidents of ambiguous lighting.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n[[Image:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|225px|right|\"Kanizsa Triangle\". These spatially separate fragments give the impression of illusory contours (also known as modal completion) of a triangle]]\nIn ambiguous images, an illusion is often produced from [[illusory contours]]. An illusory contour is a perceived contour without the presence of a physical gradient. In examples where a white shape appears to occlude black objects on a white background, the white shape appears to be brighter than the background, and the edges of this shape produce the illusory contours.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bradley | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Dumais | first2 = S.T. | year = 1975 | title = Ambiguous cognitive contours | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 257 | issue = 5527| pages = 582\u2013584 | doi = 10.1038/257582a0 | pmid = 1165783 | bibcode = 1975Natur.257..582B }}</ref> These illusory contours are processed by the brain in a similar way as real contours.<ref name=\"halko\"/> The visual system accomplishes this by making inferences beyond the information that is presented in much the same way as the luminance gradient.\n\n==Gestalt grouping rules==\nIn mid-level vision, the visual system utilizes a set of heuristic methods, called [[Gestalt grouping rules]], to quickly identify a basic perception of an object that helps to resolve an ambiguity.<ref name=\"wimmer\"/> This allows perception to be fast and easy by observing patterns and familiar images rather than a slow process of identifying each part of a group. This aids in resolving ambiguous images because the visual system will accept small variations in the pattern and still perceive the pattern as a whole. The Gestalt grouping rules are the result of the experience of the visual system. Once a pattern is perceived frequently, it is stored in memory and can be perceived again easily without the requirement of examining the entire object again.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> For example, when looking at a chess board, we perceive a checker pattern and not a set of alternating black and white squares.\n\n===Good continuation===\nThe principle of good continuation provides the visual system a basis for identifying continuing edges. This means that when a set of lines is perceived, there is a tendency for a line to continue in one direction. This allows the visual system to identify the edges of a complex image by identifying points where lines cross. For example, two lines crossed in an \"X\" shape will be perceived as two lines travelling diagonally rather than two lines changing direction to form \"V\" shapes opposite to each other. An example of an ambiguous image would be two curving lines intersecting at a point. This junction would be perceived the same way as the \"X\", where the intersection is seen as the lines crossing rather than turning away from each other. Illusions of good continuation are often used by magicians to trick audiences.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bamhart | first1 = A.S. | year = 2010 | title = The exploitation of gestalt principles by magicians | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/86bb75069391da9408b78ddb90b3698952c0f447| journal = Perception | volume = 39 | issue = 9| pages = 1286\u20131289 | doi = 10.1068/p6766 | pmid = 21125955 }}</ref>\n\n===Similarity===\nThe rule of similarity states that images that are similar to each other can be grouped together as being the same type of object or part of the same object. Therefore, the more similar two images or objects are, the more likely it will be that they can be grouped together. For example, two squares among many circles will be grouped together. They can vary in similarity of colour, size, orientation and other properties, but will ultimately be grouped together with varying degrees of membership.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Proximity, common region, and connectedness===\n[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of Proximity]]\nThe grouping property of ''proximity (Gestalt)'' is the spatial distance between two objects. The closer two objects are, the more likely they belong to the same group. This perception can be ambiguous without the person perceiving it as ambiguous. For example, two objects with varying distances and orientations from the viewer may appear to be proximal to each other, while a third object may be closer to one of the other objects but appear farther.\n\nObjects occupying a common region on the image appear to already be members of the same group. This can include unique spatial location, such as two objects occupying a distinct region of space outside of their group's own. Objects can have close proximity but appear as though part of a distinct group through various visual aids such as a threshold of colours separating the two objects.\n\nAdditionally, objects can be visually connected in ways such as drawing a line going from each object. These similar but hierarchical rules suggest that some Gestalt rules can override other rules.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n==Texture segmentation and figure-ground assignments==\nThe visual system can also aid itself in resolving ambiguities by detecting the pattern of texture in an image. This is accomplished by using many of the Gestalt principles. The texture can provide information that helps to distinguish whole objects, and the changing texture in an image reveals which distinct objects may be part of the same group. Texture segmentation rules often both cooperate and compete with each other, and examining the texture can yield information about the layers of the image, disambiguating the background, foreground, and the object.<ref>Tang, X.A model for figure-ground segmentation by self-organized cue integration. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3245. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621577763</ref>\n\n===Size and surroundedness===\nWhen a region of texture completely surrounds another region of texture, it is likely the background. Additionally, the smaller regions of texture in an image are likely the figure.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Parallelism and symmetry===\n[[Angle of parallelism|Parallelism]] is another way to disambiguate the figure of an image. The orientation of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define the figure of an image.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Extremal edges and relative motion===\nAn extremal edge is a change in texture that suggests an object is in front of or behind another object. This can be due to a shading effect on the edges of one region of texture, giving the appearance of depth. Some extremal edge effects can overwhelm the segmentations of surroundedness or size. The edges perceived can also aid in distinguishing objects by examining the change in texture against an edge due to motion.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n====Using ambiguous images to hide in the real world: camouflage====\nIn nature, [[camouflage]] is used by organisms to escape predators. This is achieved through creating an ambiguity of texture segmentation by imitating the surrounding environment. Without being able to perceive noticeable differences in texture and position, a predator will be unable to see their prey.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n==Occlusion==\nMany ambiguous images are produced through some occlusion, wherein an object's texture suddenly stops. An occlusion is the [[visual perception]] of one object being behind or in front of another object, providing information about the order of the layers of texture.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> The illusion of occlusion is apparent in the effect of illusory contours, where occlusion is perceived despite being non-existent. Here, an ambiguous image is perceived to be an instance of occlusion. When an object is occluded, the visual system only has information about the parts of the object that can be seen, so the rest of the processing must be done deeper and must involve memory.\n\n==Accidental viewpoints==\nAn accidental viewpoint is a single visual position that produces an ambiguous image. The accidental viewpoint does not provide enough information to distinguish what the object is.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Koning | first1 = A. | last2 = van Lier | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = No symmetry advantage when object matching involves accidental viewpoints | url = | journal = Psychological Research| volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 52\u201358 | doi = 10.1007/s00426-004-0191-8 | pmid = 15480756 }}</ref> Often, this image is perceived incorrectly and produces an illusion that differs from reality. For example, an image may be split in half, with the top half being enlarged and placed further away from the perceiver in space. This image will be perceived as one complete image from only a single viewpoint in space, rather than the reality of two separate halves of an object.  Street artists often use tricks of point-of-view to create 2-dimensional scenes on the ground that appear 3-dimensional.\n\n==Recognizing an object through high-level vision==\n[[File:Schroeder's stairs.svg|thumb|[[Schroeder's stairs]]]]\n\nTo go further than just perceiving the object is to recognize the object. Recognizing an object plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguous images, and relies heavily on memory and prior knowledge. To recognize an object, the visual system detects familiar components of it, and compares the perceptual representation of it with a representation of the object stored in memory.<ref name=\"halko\"/> This can be done using various templates of an object, such as \"dog\" to represent dogs in general. The template method is not always successful because members of a group may significantly differ visually from each other, and may look much different if viewed from different angles. To counter the problem of viewpoint, the visual system detects familiar components of an object in 3-dimensional space. If the components of an object perceived are in the same position and orientation of an object in memory, recognition is possible.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> Research has shown that people that are more creative in their imagery are better able to resolve ambiguous images. This may be due to their ability to quickly identify patterns in the image.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riquelme | first1 = H | year = 2002 | title = Can people creative in imagery interpret ambiguous figures faster than people less creative in imagery? | url = | journal = The Journal of Creative Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 105\u2013116 | doi = 10.1002/j.2162-6057.2002.tb01059.x }}</ref> When making a [[mental representation]] of an ambiguous image, in the same way as normal images, each part is defined and then put onto the mental representation.

These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total. In 2012 a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson in the book 'In Upp\u00e5ner med Lilla Lisen & Gamle Muppen'. ({{ISBN|978-91-7089-524-1}})\n\n==Identifying and resolving ambiguous images==\nMiddle vision is the stage in visual processing that combines all the basic features in the scene into distinct, recognizable object groups. This stage of vision comes before high-level vision (understanding the scene) and after early vision (determining the basic features of an image). When perceiving and recognizing images, mid-level vision comes into use when we need to classify the object we are seeing. Higher-level vision is used when the object classified must now be recognized as a specific member of its group. For example, through mid-level vision we perceive a face, then through high-level vision we recognize a face of a familiar person. Mid-level vision and high-level vision are crucial for understanding a reality that is filled with ambiguous perceptual inputs.<ref name=\"Wolfe\">Wolfe, J., Kluender, K., & Levi, D. (2009). Sensation and perception. (2 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.</ref>\n\n==Perceiving the image in mid-level vision==\nWhen we see an image, the first thing we do is attempt to organize all the parts of the scene into different groups.<ref name=\"halko\">Halko, M.A. Illusory contour and surface completion mechanisms in human visual cortex. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3303. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621754807</ref> To do this, one of the most basic methods used is finding the edges. Edges can include obvious perceptions such as the edge of a house, and can include other perceptions that the brain needs to process deeper, such as the edges of a person's facial features. When finding edges, the brain's visual system detects a point on the image with a sharp contrast of lighting. Being able to detect the location of the edge of an object aids in recognizing the object. In ambiguous images, detecting edges still seems natural to the person perceiving the image. However, the brain undergoes deeper processing to resolve the ambiguity. For example, consider an image that involves an opposite change in magnitude of luminance between the object and the background (e.g. From the top, the background shifts from black to white, and the object shifts from white to black). The opposing [[gradient]]s will eventually come to a point where there is an equal degree of luminance of the object and the background. At this point, there is no edge to be perceived. To counter this, the visual system connects the image as a whole rather than a set of edges, allowing one to see an object rather than edges and non-edges. Although there is no complete image to be seen, the brain is able to accomplish this because of its understanding of the physical world and real incidents of ambiguous lighting.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n[[Image:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|225px|right|\"Kanizsa Triangle\". These spatially separate fragments give the impression of illusory contours (also known as modal completion) of a triangle]]\nIn ambiguous images, an illusion is often produced from [[illusory contours]]. An illusory contour is a perceived contour without the presence of a physical gradient. In examples where a white shape appears to occlude black objects on a white background, the white shape appears to be brighter than the background, and the edges of this shape produce the illusory contours.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bradley | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Dumais | first2 = S.T. | year = 1975 | title = Ambiguous cognitive contours | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 257 | issue = 5527| pages = 582\u2013584 | doi = 10.1038/257582a0 | pmid = 1165783 | bibcode = 1975Natur.257..582B }}</ref> These illusory contours are processed by the brain in a similar way as real contours.<ref name=\"halko\"/> The visual system accomplishes this by making inferences beyond the information that is presented in much the same way as the luminance gradient.\n\n==Gestalt grouping rules==\nIn mid-level vision, the visual system utilizes a set of heuristic methods, called [[Gestalt grouping rules]], to quickly identify a basic perception of an object that helps to resolve an ambiguity.<ref name=\"wimmer\"/> This allows perception to be fast and easy by observing patterns and familiar images rather than a slow process of identifying each part of a group. This aids in resolving ambiguous images because the visual system will accept small variations in the pattern and still perceive the pattern as a whole. The Gestalt grouping rules are the result of the experience of the visual system. Once a pattern is perceived frequently, it is stored in memory and can be perceived again easily without the requirement of examining the entire object again.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> For example, when looking at a chess board, we perceive a checker pattern and not a set of alternating black and white squares.\n\n===Good continuation===\nThe principle of good continuation provides the visual system a basis for identifying continuing edges. This means that when a set of lines is perceived, there is a tendency for a line to continue in one direction. This allows the visual system to identify the edges of a complex image by identifying points where lines cross. For example, two lines crossed in an \"X\" shape will be perceived as two lines travelling diagonally rather than two lines changing direction to form \"V\" shapes opposite to each other. An example of an ambiguous image would be two curving lines intersecting at a point. This junction would be perceived the same way as the \"X\", where the intersection is seen as the lines crossing rather than turning away from each other. Illusions of good continuation are often used by magicians to trick audiences.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bamhart | first1 = A.S. | year = 2010 | title = The exploitation of gestalt principles by magicians | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/86bb75069391da9408b78ddb90b3698952c0f447| journal = Perception | volume = 39 | issue = 9| pages = 1286\u20131289 | doi = 10.1068/p6766 | pmid = 21125955 }}</ref>\n\n===Similarity===\nThe rule of similarity states that images that are similar to each other can be grouped together as being the same type of object or part of the same object. Therefore, the more similar two images or objects are, the more likely it will be that they can be grouped together. For example, two squares among many circles will be grouped together. They can vary in similarity of colour, size, orientation and other properties, but will ultimately be grouped together with varying degrees of membership.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Proximity, common region, and connectedness===\n[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of Proximity]]\nThe grouping property of ''proximity (Gestalt)'' is the spatial distance between two objects. The closer two objects are, the more likely they belong to the same group. This perception can be ambiguous without the person perceiving it as ambiguous. For example, two objects with varying distances and orientations from the viewer may appear to be proximal to each other, while a third object may be closer to one of the other objects but appear farther.\n\nObjects occupying a common region on the image appear to already be members of the same group. This can include unique spatial location, such as two objects occupying a distinct region of space outside of their group's own. Objects can have close proximity but appear as though part of a distinct group through various visual aids such as a threshold of colours separating the two objects.\n\nAdditionally, objects can be visually connected in ways such as drawing a line going from each object. These similar but hierarchical rules suggest that some Gestalt rules can override other rules.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n==Texture segmentation and figure-ground assignments==\nThe visual system can also aid itself in resolving ambiguities by detecting the pattern of texture in an image. This is accomplished by using many of the Gestalt principles. The texture can provide information that helps to distinguish whole objects, and the changing texture in an image reveals which distinct objects may be part of the same group. Texture segmentation rules often both cooperate and compete with each other, and examining the texture can yield information about the layers of the image, disambiguating the background, foreground, and the object.<ref>Tang, X.A model for figure-ground segmentation by self-organized cue integration. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3245. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621577763</ref>\n\n===Size and surroundedness===\nWhen a region of texture completely surrounds another region of texture, it is likely the background. Additionally, the smaller regions of texture in an image are likely the figure.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Parallelism and symmetry===\n[[Angle of parallelism|Parallelism]] is another way to disambiguate the figure of an image. The orientation of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define the figure of an image.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n===Extremal edges and relative motion===\nAn extremal edge is a change in texture that suggests an object is in front of or behind another object. This can be due to a shading effect on the edges of one region of texture, giving the appearance of depth. Some extremal edge effects can overwhelm the segmentations of surroundedness or size. The edges perceived can also aid in distinguishing objects by examining the change in texture against an edge due to motion.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n====Using ambiguous images to hide in the real world: camouflage====\nIn nature, [[camouflage]] is used by organisms to escape predators. This is achieved through creating an ambiguity of texture segmentation by imitating the surrounding environment. Without being able to perceive noticeable differences in texture and position, a predator will be unable to see their prey.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/>\n\n==Occlusion==\nMany ambiguous images are produced through some occlusion, wherein an object's texture suddenly stops. An occlusion is the [[visual perception]] of one object being behind or in front of another object, providing information about the order of the layers of texture.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> The illusion of occlusion is apparent in the effect of illusory contours, where occlusion is perceived despite being non-existent. Here, an ambiguous image is perceived to be an instance of occlusion. When an object is occluded, the visual system only has information about the parts of the object that can be seen, so the rest of the processing must be done deeper and must involve memory.\n\n==Accidental viewpoints==\nAn accidental viewpoint is a single visual position that produces an ambiguous image. The accidental viewpoint does not provide enough information to distinguish what the object is.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Koning | first1 = A. | last2 = van Lier | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = No symmetry advantage when object matching involves accidental viewpoints | url = | journal = Psychological Research| volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 52\u201358 | doi = 10.1007/s00426-004-0191-8 | pmid = 15480756 }}</ref> Often, this image is perceived incorrectly and produces an illusion that differs from reality. For example, an image may be split in half, with the top half being enlarged and placed further away from the perceiver in space. This image will be perceived as one complete image from only a single viewpoint in space, rather than the reality of two separate halves of an object.  Street artists often use tricks of point-of-view to create 2-dimensional scenes on the ground that appear 3-dimensional.\n\n==Recognizing an object through high-level vision==\n[[File:Schroeder's stairs.svg|thumb|[[Schroeder's stairs]]]]\n\nTo go further than just perceiving the object is to recognize the object. Recognizing an object plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguous images, and relies heavily on memory and prior knowledge. To recognize an object, the visual system detects familiar components of it, and compares the perceptual representation of it with a representation of the object stored in memory.<ref name=\"halko\"/> This can be done using various templates of an object, such as \"dog\" to represent dogs in general. The template method is not always successful because members of a group may significantly differ visually from each other, and may look much different if viewed from different angles. To counter the problem of viewpoint, the visual system detects familiar components of an object in 3-dimensional space. If the components of an object perceived are in the same position and orientation of an object in memory, recognition is possible.<ref name=\"Wolfe\"/> Research has shown that people that are more creative in their imagery are better able to resolve ambiguous images. This may be due to their ability to quickly identify patterns in the image.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riquelme | first1 = H | year = 2002 | title = Can people creative in imagery interpret ambiguous figures faster than people less creative in imagery? | url = | journal = The Journal of Creative Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 105\u2013116 | doi = 10.1002/j.2162-6057.2002.tb01059.x }}</ref> When making a [[mental representation]] of an ambiguous image, in the same way as normal images, each part is defined and then put onto the mental representation.

Without memory and prior knowledge, an image with several groups of similar objects will be difficult to perceive. Any object can have an ambiguous representation and can be mistakenly categorized into the wrong groups without sufficient memory recognition of an object.

It was for this reason that the Leeds & District organisation was formalised when a meeting took place at the Green Dragon Hotel, Leeds on 27 September 1888. The foundation clubs were [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], [[Holbeck Rugby Club|Holbeck]], [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]], Kirkstall, [[Leeds Parish Church RFC (Rugby League)|Leeds Parish Church]], Leeds St John's and Wortley.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leeds and District Rugby League |url=http://www.barla.org.uk/News/Details.asp?id=2569 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928004123/http://www.barla.org.uk/News/Details.asp?id=2569 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 the Cardigan Estate was sold at auction and Lot 17a was purchased by a group of Leeds citizens, who intended to form the city's leading sports club. Lot 17a became what is now Headingley Stadium.\n\nLeeds St John's played its final season under that name in 1889\u201390, before becoming the football section of Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Co Ltd the following season. With Headingley still being completed, Leeds' first game was staged at Cardigan Fields, the home side defeating [[Otley]].

That same year saw the formation of the [[RFL Championship First Division|Northern Rugby League]], with a number of leading clubs leaving the Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League and joining the new competition. Leeds was not admitted until the following year when it was placed in the newly formed second division and quickly gained promotion as runners-up to [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]].\n\n[[Leeds City FC]] joined soccer's Second Division in 1905\u201306, and finished sixth out of 20 clubs in the club's first season.

Leeds beat [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], [[Rochdale Hornets]], [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]] and then scraped through 11\u201310 against [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] in the semi-final before meeting [[Hull F.C.]] in the final. Rain on the morning of the game meant conditions were against flowing rugby. The scores were level at 7\u20137 with fifteen minutes left. However, neither team could break the deadlock, and the final went to a replay two days later, again at [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|Fartown]], [[Huddersfield]]. Leeds made no mistake this time and ran out convincing 26\u201312 winners having led 16\u20130 at half-time.\n\nThe club lost many players to the [[First World War]]; of a total of fifty-one players who served in the military, fifteen were killed. The usual league programme was interrupted during 1914\u201318. During this period, Leeds played a number of \"guest players\" in the Emergency League competition. The Headingley club reached the Championship final for the first time in 1915, but lost 35\u20132 to [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]], then a record score. The Emergency League was then suspended. Leeds reverted to rugby union during the First World War to play a one-off challenge game against the [[Royal Navy]] Depot from [[Plymouth]] in 1917. This was a precursor to the following [[Christmas]] when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game 9\u20133 on [[Christmas Eve]] but proved equally adept at league recording a 24\u20133 win on 28 December.\n\n===1921\u20131942: Inter-war period===\nIn 1921, [[Harold Buck]] became the game's first \u00a31,000 transfer when he moved from [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] to Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php |title=The History Of Rugby League |publisher=Napit.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rlheritage.co.uk/history.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210111448/http://www.rlheritage.co.uk/history.html |date=10 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn Saturday 27 October 1934, Leeds and [[Wakefield Trinity]] met in the final of the Yorkshire Cup at [[Crown Flatt]], [[Dewsbury]].

Vic was regarded as a major loss to the Australian game and this contributed to the RFL imposing a ban on international transfers, which lasted until 1940.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/memorable-players ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011243/http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/memorable-players |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Leeds played [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] in the Rugby Football League Championship semi-final.

Their confrontations on the field during the Leeds v Bradford Northern local derby games are part of rugby league folklore.\n\nIt was not until the late 1950s, when in 1957 the club secured its first post-war Challenge Cup victory, that the young side being built began to show signs of what was to come. [[Joe Warham]] came to Leeds as coach in 1958 and a Yorkshire Cup triumph followed, but the side still lacked enough quality to compete at the top of the Lancashire section of the competition in which it was then playing.\n\nHowever, '''\"the Loiners\"''' (their historical nickname) were to establish themselves as a dominant force by the end of the coming decade.

The club has also looked into the possibility of redeveloping the South Stand and the Western Terrace, however any redevelopment or expansion of the Western Terrace would require the demolition of housing and rerouting of a public right of way.\n[[File:Leeds Rhinos vs. Salford Red Devils, Headingley Stadium (21st April 2014) 012.JPG|thumb|left|750px|Headingley panorama]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==\nLeeds have had four shirt sponsors since 1981, the current sponsors, [[Leeds Building Society]] are currently the longest sponsorship deal the club have had and is the longest in the [[Super League]].

After a nine-year hiatus, League Publications Ltd, having bought Rugby League World, brought back the award in 1999. In 2011 they decided to give Schofield his Golden Boot and he is now included in the roll call of winners of the prestigious award.\n\nThe oldest winner of the award is [[Kevin Sinfield]], who won in 2012 at the age of 32.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Winner\n|-\n|1990||{{flagicon|England}} [[Garry Schofield]]\n|-\n|2012||{{flagicon|England}} [[Kevin Sinfield]]\n|}\n\n===Testimonials===\n{{Main|List of testimonial players at Leeds Rhinos}}\n\n===Players with honours===\n{{Main|List of Leeds Rhinos players with honours}}\n\n===Captains===\n{{Main|List of Leeds Rhinos captains}}\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe Rhinos instigated a [[hall of fame]] in 2017.

club in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The club was formed in 1870 as Leeds St John's and play in the [[Super League]], the top tier of English rugby league. They play home matches at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley Stadium]] since 1890.\n\nIn 1895, Leeds was one of twenty-two rugby clubs which broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and formed what is now the [[Rugby Football League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/ticket-exchange|title=Ticketmaster.co.uk - Resale Tickets &#124; Sell Tickets &#124; Ticket Exchange by Ticketmaster|website=www.ticketmaster.co.uk}}</ref> The club was known simply as Leeds until the end of the [[Super League I|1996 season]], when they added '''Rhinos''' to their name. They are also historically known as the '''Loiners''', referring to the [[Loiner|demonym]] for a native of Leeds.\n\nLeeds have won 11 [[Super League|League Titles]], 13 [[Challenge Cup|Challenge Cups]] and three [[World Club Challenge]] titles. Leeds play in blue and amber kits at home matches and historically have worn either white or yellow away kits. They share rivalries with [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors]], [[Bradford Bulls]] and [[Castleford Tigers]] as well as a local city rivalry with [[Hunslet RLFC|Hunslet]].\n\n==History==\n===1870\u20131895: Foundation and early years===\nIn 1864, H. I. Johnson placed an advert in the ''Leeds Mercury'' inviting players to meet up at [[Woodhouse Moor]] a few days a week from 7&nbsp;a.m. to 8&nbsp;a.m. That advert attracted more than 500 members.

It was for this reason that the Leeds & District organisation was formalised when a meeting took place at the Green Dragon Hotel, Leeds on 27 September 1888. The foundation clubs were [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], [[Holbeck Rugby Club|Holbeck]], [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]], Kirkstall, [[Leeds Parish Church RFC (Rugby League)|Leeds Parish Church]], Leeds St John's and Wortley.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leeds and District Rugby League |url=http://www.barla.org.uk/News/Details.asp?id=2569 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928004123/http://www.barla.org.uk/News/Details.asp?id=2569 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 the Cardigan Estate was sold at auction and Lot 17a was purchased by a group of Leeds citizens, who intended to form the city's leading sports club. Lot 17a became what is now Headingley Stadium.\n\nLeeds St John's played its final season under that name in 1889\u201390, before becoming the football section of Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Co Ltd the following season. With Headingley still being completed, Leeds' first game was staged at Cardigan Fields, the home side defeating [[Otley]]. The first game at Headingley was played on 20 September 1890, when [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]] were beaten by one try and one dropped goal to nil.\n\nIn 1892, 27,654 spectators, a then record in British rugby, attended the third round showdown between Leeds and [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] at Headingley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therugbyleaguewebsite.co.uk/leeds-rhinos-c29.html |title=Financial Advisers In Coventry |publisher=Therugbyleaguewebsite.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011241/http://www.therugbyleaguewebsite.co.uk/leeds-rhinos-c29.html |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1895\u20131920: Northern Union breakaway===\n[[File:Leeds rhinos rugby c1900.jpg|thumb|250px|Rhinos team of 1899\u20131900]]\nA special general meeting was held in 1895 which voted decisively to support the breakaway [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] as a founder member, resulting in two resignations from the club.

That same year saw the formation of the [[RFL Championship First Division|Northern Rugby League]], with a number of leading clubs leaving the Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League and joining the new competition. Leeds was not admitted until the following year when it was placed in the newly formed second division and quickly gained promotion as runners-up to [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]].\n\n[[Leeds City FC]] joined soccer's Second Division in 1905\u201306, and finished sixth out of 20 clubs in the club's first season.

Leeds beat [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], [[Rochdale Hornets]], [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]] and then scraped through 11\u201310 against [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] in the semi-final before meeting [[Hull F.C.]] in the final. Rain on the morning of the game meant conditions were against flowing rugby. The scores were level at 7\u20137 with fifteen minutes left. However, neither team could break the deadlock, and the final went to a replay two days later, again at [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|Fartown]], [[Huddersfield]]. Leeds made no mistake this time and ran out convincing 26\u201312 winners having led 16\u20130 at half-time.\n\nThe club lost many players to the [[First World War]]; of a total of fifty-one players who served in the military, fifteen were killed. The usual league programme was interrupted during 1914\u201318. During this period, Leeds played a number of \"guest players\" in the Emergency League competition. The Headingley club reached the Championship final for the first time in 1915, but lost 35\u20132 to [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]], then a record score. The Emergency League was then suspended. Leeds reverted to rugby union during the First World War to play a one-off challenge game against the [[Royal Navy]] Depot from [[Plymouth]] in 1917. This was a precursor to the following [[Christmas]] when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game 9\u20133 on [[Christmas Eve]] but proved equally adept at league recording a 24\u20133 win on 28 December.\n\n===1921\u20131942: Inter-war period===\nIn 1921, [[Harold Buck]] became the game's first \u00a31,000 transfer when he moved from [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] to Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php |title=The History Of Rugby League |publisher=Napit.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rlheritage.co.uk/history.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210111448/http://www.rlheritage.co.uk/history.html |date=10 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn Saturday 27 October 1934, Leeds and [[Wakefield Trinity]] met in the final of the Yorkshire Cup at [[Crown Flatt]], [[Dewsbury]].

Vic was regarded as a major loss to the Australian game and this contributed to the RFL imposing a ban on international transfers, which lasted until 1940.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/memorable-players ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011243/http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/memorable-players |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Leeds played [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] in the Rugby Football League Championship semi-final.

His rivalry with the Great Britain and Wales prop [[Frank Whitcombe]] who played for [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] was legendary. Their confrontations on the field during the Leeds v Bradford Northern local derby games are part of rugby league folklore.\n\nIt was not until the late 1950s, when in 1957 the club secured its first post-war Challenge Cup victory, that the young side being built began to show signs of what was to come. [[Joe Warham]] came to Leeds as coach in 1958 and a Yorkshire Cup triumph followed, but the side still lacked enough quality to compete at the top of the Lancashire section of the competition in which it was then playing.\n\nHowever, '''\"the Loiners\"''' (their historical nickname) were to establish themselves as a dominant force by the end of the coming decade. In 1960 Dai Prosser was appointed to assist Joe Warham with the coaching duties and the club signed a new back three of Jack Fairbank, [[Brian Shaw (rugby league)|Brian Shaw]] and [[Dennis Goodwin]] to strengthen the forward pack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shopwiki.co.uk/detail/d=Headingley_Heroes:_Leeds_RLFC_in_the_60s_and_70s/ |title=Headingley_Heroes:_Leeds_RLFC_in_the_60s_and_70s |publisher=Shopwiki.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The recruitment paid off: the club was crowned Champions for the first time in 1961 with [[Lewis Jones (rugby)|Lewis Jones]] leading them to a 25\u201310 victory over [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] in the Championship Final at [[Odsal Stadium]], [[Bradford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/yourviews/LEEDS-RHINOS-Your-messages-of.4560628.jp |title=LEEDS RHINOS: Your messages of congratulations for the 2008 champions \u2013 RL Headlines |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1960\u20131980: First Championship titles===\nIn the late 1960s, under the guidance of [[Roy Francis (rugby)|Roy Francis]], Leeds repeatedly finished top of the league.

The club has also looked into the possibility of redeveloping the South Stand and the Western Terrace, however any redevelopment or expansion of the Western Terrace would require the demolition of housing and rerouting of a public right of way.\n[[File:Leeds Rhinos vs. Salford Red Devils, Headingley Stadium (21st April 2014) 012.JPG|thumb|left|750px|Headingley panorama]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==\nLeeds have had four shirt sponsors since 1981, the current sponsors, [[Leeds Building Society]] are currently the longest sponsorship deal the club have had and is the longest in the [[Super League]].

After a nine-year hiatus, League Publications Ltd, having bought Rugby League World, brought back the award in 1999. In 2011 they decided to give Schofield his Golden Boot and he is now included in the roll call of winners of the prestigious award.\n\nThe oldest winner of the award is [[Kevin Sinfield]], who won in 2012 at the age of 32.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Winner\n|-\n|1990||{{flagicon|England}} [[Garry Schofield]]\n|-\n|2012||{{flagicon|England}} [[Kevin Sinfield]]\n|}\n\n===Testimonials===\n{{Main|List of testimonial players at Leeds Rhinos}}\n\n===Players with honours===\n{{Main|List of Leeds Rhinos players with honours}}\n\n===Captains===\n{{Main|List of Leeds Rhinos captains}}\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe Rhinos instigated a [[hall of fame]] in 2017.
