In the 15th century, muftis of the [[Ottoman empire]], who had acted as independent scholars in earlier times, began to be integrated into a hierarchical bureaucracy of religious institutions and scholars. By the end of the 16th century, the government-appointed mufti of Istanbul came to be recognized under the title ''[[Shaykh al-Islam]]'' (Turkish: ''\u015feyh\u00fclislam'') as the Grand Mufti in charge of this hierarchy. The Ottoman Grand Mufti performed a number of functions, including advising the sultan on religious matters, legitimizing government policies, and appointing judges. After the dissolution the Ottoman empire the office of the Grand Mufti has been adopted in a number of countries across the Muslim world, often serving the role of providing religious support for government policies.<ref name=PEIPT/> The Grand Mufti is generally an individual appointed by the state, although the office has collective or elective character in some modern countries.<ref name=ODI/><ref name=PEIPT/>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Mufti}}\nMuftis are Muslim religious scholars who issue legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) interpreting [[Sharia]] ([[Islam]]ic law).<ref name=\"Vogel\">{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saud\u00ed: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004110625}}</ref>{{rp|16\u201320}} The [[Ottoman Empire]] began the practice of giving official recognition and status to a single mufti, above all others, as the Grand Mufti.<ref name=\"Vogel\"/>{{rp|5}} The Grand Mufti of [[Istanbul]] had, since the late 16th century, come to be regarded as the head of the religious establishment.<ref name=\"Faroqh\">{{cite book|last1=Faroqhi|first1=Suraiya N.|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey.

During [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), there were two competing Grand Muftis of Jerusalem, one endorsed by the British and one by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. When Palestine was under British rule, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a position appointed by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] authorities. In the [[Palestinian National Authority]], the [[Public administration|administrative]] organization established to [[government|govern]] parts of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], the Grand Mufti is appointed by the president.\n\n===Malaysia===\nMalaysia has a unique system of collective mufti. Nine of the fourteen Malaysian states have their own [[constitutional monarchy]]; nine are ruled by their own constitutional monarch while the country is led by a monarch elected from the nine. These nine monarchs have authority over religious matters within their own states: therefore, each of these nine states have their own mufti who usually controls the Islamic Council or Islamic Department of the state. At the national level, a National Council of Fatwa (Majlis Fatwa Kebangsaan) has been formed under the Department of Islamic Advancement of Malaysia (Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia or JAKIM). JAKIM appoints five Muftis for the five states which do not have monarchs. The muftis of the nine monarchical states, together with the five officials appointed by JAKIM in the National Council of Fatw\u0101, collectively issue fat\u0101w\u0101 at the national level.\n\n===Mughal Empire===\nIn the [[Mughal Empire]], the Grand Mufti of India was a state official.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Grand Mufti was a state official, and the Grand Mufti of [[Constantinople]] was the highest of these.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nThe [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], with office created in 1953, is appointed by the King.\n\n===Tunisia===\nAccording to Article 78 of the [[Constitution of Tunisia|2014 Constitution]], the Grand Mufti of Tunisia is appointed and can be dismissed by the [[President of Tunisia|President of the Republic]].<ref name=engcon>{{cite book|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TUNISIAN REPUBLIC (Unofficial english translation)|date=26 January 2014|publisher=UNDP and International IDEA|chapter=Title four, chapter one, article 78|chapter-url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210602/http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== '''South Africa''' ===\nThe Mufti of South Africa is elected by the [[Muslim Judicial Council]] \n\n==List of Grand Muftis==\n{{Cleanup|reason=many non-notable and unsourced entries|section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In the 15th century, muftis of the [[Ottoman empire]], who had acted as independent scholars in earlier times, began to be integrated into a hierarchical bureaucracy of religious institutions and scholars. By the end of the 16th century, the government-appointed mufti of Istanbul came to be recognized under the title ''[[Shaykh al-Islam]]'' (Turkish: ''\u015feyh\u00fclislam'') as the Grand Mufti in charge of this hierarchy. The Ottoman Grand Mufti performed a number of functions, including advising the sultan on religious matters, legitimizing government policies, and appointing judges. After the dissolution the Ottoman empire the office of the Grand Mufti has been adopted in a number of countries across the Muslim world, often serving the role of providing religious support for government policies.<ref name=PEIPT/> The Grand Mufti is generally an individual appointed by the state, although the office has collective or elective character in some modern countries.<ref name=ODI/><ref name=PEIPT/>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Mufti}}\nMuftis are Muslim religious scholars who issue legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) interpreting [[Sharia]] ([[Islam]]ic law).<ref name=\"Vogel\">{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saud\u00ed: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004110625}}</ref>{{rp|16\u201320}} The [[Ottoman Empire]] began the practice of giving official recognition and status to a single mufti, above all others, as the Grand Mufti.<ref name=\"Vogel\"/>{{rp|5}} The Grand Mufti of [[Istanbul]] had, since the late 16th century, come to be regarded as the head of the religious establishment.<ref name=\"Faroqh\">{{cite book|last1=Faroqhi|first1=Suraiya N.|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey.

During [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), there were two competing Grand Muftis of Jerusalem, one endorsed by the British and one by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. When Palestine was under British rule, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a position appointed by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] authorities. In the [[Palestinian National Authority]], the [[Public administration|administrative]] organization established to [[government|govern]] parts of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], the Grand Mufti is appointed by the president.\n\n===Malaysia===\nMalaysia has a unique system of collective mufti. Nine of the fourteen Malaysian states have their own [[constitutional monarchy]]; nine are ruled by their own constitutional monarch while the country is led by a monarch elected from the nine. These nine monarchs have authority over religious matters within their own states: therefore, each of these nine states have their own mufti who usually controls the Islamic Council or Islamic Department of the state. At the national level, a National Council of Fatwa (Majlis Fatwa Kebangsaan) has been formed under the Department of Islamic Advancement of Malaysia (Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia or JAKIM). JAKIM appoints five Muftis for the five states which do not have monarchs. The muftis of the nine monarchical states, together with the five officials appointed by JAKIM in the National Council of Fatw\u0101, collectively issue fat\u0101w\u0101 at the national level.\n\n===Mughal Empire===\nIn the [[Mughal Empire]], the Grand Mufti of India was a state official.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Grand Mufti was a state official, and the Grand Mufti of [[Constantinople]] was the highest of these.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nThe [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], with office created in 1953, is appointed by the King.\n\n===Tunisia===\nAccording to Article 78 of the [[Constitution of Tunisia|2014 Constitution]], the Grand Mufti of Tunisia is appointed and can be dismissed by the [[President of Tunisia|President of the Republic]].<ref name=engcon>{{cite book|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TUNISIAN REPUBLIC (Unofficial english translation)|date=26 January 2014|publisher=UNDP and International IDEA|chapter=Title four, chapter one, article 78|chapter-url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210602/http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==List of Grand Muftis==\n{{Cleanup|reason=many non-notable and unsourced entries|section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

During the late 1900s and early 2000s, historian [[Silvio Bedini]] wrote and performed research about Banneker that refuted some of these tales while working in Washington, D.C. for over 40 years at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History|Museum of History and Technology/National Museum of American History]].<ref name=Founders>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_5ZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Locating the Federal District: Editorial Note: Footnote number 119|work=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: 24 January\u201331 March 1791|volume=19|editor-first=Julian P.|editor-last=Boyd|editor-link=Julian P.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career. Klinkowitz noted that Murray had not provided any support for his claim that Banneker had recalled L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C.

When describing the ceremonial presentation to [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., of a [[sundial]] memorializing Banneker, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper reported in that year that a speaker had claimed that:\n\n<blockquote>.... he (Banneker) was appointed by President George Washington to aid Major L'Enfant, famed French architect, to plan the layout of the District of Columbia. L'Enfant died before the work was completed, which required Banneker to carry on in his stead.<ref name=Defender>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|format=PDF|title=Howard U Gets Memorial to Benjamin Banneker |work=Chicago, Illinois: [[The Chicago Defender]] (National edition)|date=1929-02-16 |page=A1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers |accessdate=2017-11-09|via=[http://www.thepearlofomega.org The Pearl of Omega]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109123630/http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, as a book that won the 1917 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] had earlier reported, L'Enfant lived long after he developed his plan for the federal capital city. He died near the City of Washington in 1825.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/withamericansofp01juss/page/190 Jusserand, p. 190.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610081848/https://books.google.com/books?id=u2MUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA190 |date=2016-06-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn other versions of the legend, Banneker spent two days reconstructing the bulk of the city's plan from his presumably [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] after L'Enfant died or departed.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

In 1971 and 1999, Bedini wrote that Banneker had constructed his clock from his recollections of that watch ([https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/42/mode/1up Bedini, 1971, p. 42.] and [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/42/mode/2up Bedini, 1999, pp. 42\u201443.]). Bedini did not identify his source for those statements. In 2008, when again describing Banneker's clock, Bedini more cautiously wrote: \"It is said that it was based on his recollections of the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" ([http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx|date=2016-02-03}}).</ref>\n\nFurther, it is open to question as to whether the clock was actually \"remarkable\". Silvio Bedini reported that at least four clockmakers were working in Annapolis, Maryland, before 1753, when Banneker completed his own clock.<ref name=Annapolis/>\n\nA photograph on the historical marker illustrates a wooden striking clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed around 1760.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/><ref>Note: [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini, 1999] contains on [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/45/mode/1up page 45] a photograph of a striking wooden clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed in Connecticut around 1760 that the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] holds in its collections. The wooden clock shown in the Benjamin Banneker Park historical marker is identical to the one shown in the photograph in Bedini, 1999.</ref> The marker does not indicate that the clock is not Banneker's.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/> A fire on the day of Banneker's funeral reportedly destroyed his own clock.<ref name=Bailey/><ref name=Tyson18/>\n\n===Historical marker in Newseum, Washington, DC===\nIn 2008, when the [[Newseum]] opened to the public on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., visitors looking over the Avenue could read a historical marker that stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nBenjamin Banneker assisted Chief Surveyor Andrew Ellicott in laying out the Avenue based on Pierre L'Enfant's Plan.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Banneker was employed directly by Ellicott and did not at any time, as far as can be determined, work with or for L'Enfant.\"</ref> In late February 1792, [[Presidency of George Washington|President George Washington]] dismissed L'Enfant, who had failed to have his plan published and who was experiencing frequent conflicts with the three Commissioners that Washington had appointed to supervise the planning and survey of the federal district and city.<ref name=planning/><ref name=\"Bowling\">Bowling</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/details/centennialhisto00woolgoog/page/n112 Crew, pp. 101-102] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111093014/https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA101&id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |date=2015-11-11}}<br/>(2) {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |title=Plan of the City of Washington|publisher=Washington Map Society|date=1997-03-22|accessdate=2012-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142642/http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Silvio Bedini with bust of Thomas Jefferson 1981.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>[[Smithsonian Institution]]</sup><br />Silvio Bedini (1981)</div>]]\nA number of undocumented stories connecting Benjamin Banneker with the planning and survey of the federal capital city have appeared over the years.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

{"title_page": "Nuremberg Code", "text_new": "{{about||the set of guidelines\n for determining what constitutes a war crime|Nuremberg Principles|the denaturalization of German Jews|Nuremberg Laws}}\n\nThe '''Nuremberg Code''' ({{lang-de|N\u00fcrnberger Kodex}}) is a set of [[research ethics]] principles for [[human experimentation]] created as a result of the [[subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg trials]] at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the Nuremberg Code began in pre\u2013[[World War II]] German politics, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s. The pre-war [[German Medical Association]] was considered to be a progressive yet democratic association with great concerns for public health, one example being the legislation of compulsory health insurance for German workers{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. However, starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of [[racial hygiene]], were accused by the public and the medical society of [[Unethical human experimentation|unethical]] medical practices. The use of racial hygiene was supported by the German government in order to create an Aryan \"master race\", and to exterminate those who did not fit into their criteria. Racial hygiene extremists merged with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] to promote the use of biology to accomplish their goals of racial purity, a core concept in the Nazi ideology. Physicians were attracted to the scientific ideology and aided in the establishment of National Socialist Physicians' League in 1929 to \"purify the German medical community of 'Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]]'.\" Criticism was becoming prevalent; Alfons Stauder, member of the Reich Health Office, claimed that the \"dubious experiments have no therapeutic purpose\", and Fredrich von Muller, physician and the president of the Deutsche Akademie, joined the criticism.<ref>Grodin MA.  \"Historical origins of the Nuremberg Code\".  In: ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code: Human Rights in Human Experimentation''. Annas, GJ and Grodin, MA (eds.). Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992.</ref>\n\nIn response to the criticism of unethical human experimentation, the Reich government issued \"Guidelines for New Therapy and Human Experimentation\" in [[Weimar]], Germany. The guidelines were based on [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]], but also stressed legal doctrine of [[informed consent]]. The guidelines clearly distinguished the difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. For therapeutic purposes, the guidelines allowed administration without consent only in dire situations, but for non-therapeutic purposes any administration without consent was strictly forbidden. However, the guidelines from Weimar were negated by [[Adolf Hitler]]. By 1942, the Nazi party included  more than 38,000 German physicians, who helped carry out medical programs such as [[Nazi eugenics|the Sterilization Law]].<ref>Vollmann, Jochen, and Rolf Winau. \"Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code\". ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'' 313.7070 (1996): 1445.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of [[war crime]]s. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman on May 2, 1945 and were led by the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. They began on November 20, 1945 in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, in what became known as the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In one of the trials, which became known as the \"[[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]]\", German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in [[concentration camps]], in addition to those who were involved in over 3,500,000 [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]s of German citizens.<ref name=\"Credo Refernece\">{{cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?ta=abcgeamrle&uh=eugenics_euthanasia |title=Eugenics/Euthanasia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |access-date=2013-09-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/The%20Nuremburg%20Code.htm</ref>\n\nSeveral of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from those used before the war, and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments. This worried Drs. Andrew Ivy and Leo Alexander, who worked with the prosecution during the trial. In April 1947, Dr. Alexander submitted a memorandum to the United States Counsel for War Crimes outlining six points for legitimate medical research.<ref name=\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\">{{cite web |title=Nuremberg Code |url=https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/doctors-trial/nuremberg-code |website=The Doctor's Trial: The Medical Case of the Subsequent Nuremberg Proceedings |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Online Exhibitions |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 1947, the judges delivered their verdict against [[Karl Brandt (physician)|Karl Brandt]] and 22 others.<ref name=\"Annas, George J. 1992\">Annas, George J., and Michael A. Grodin. ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992.</ref> The verdict reiterated the memorandum's points and, in response to expert medical advisers for the prosecution, revised the original six points to ten. The ten points became known as the \"Nuremberg Code\", which includes such principles as [[informed consent]] and absence of [[coercion]]; properly formulated [[scientific]] experimentation; and [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] towards experiment participants. It is thought to have been mainly based on the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which was interpreted as endorsing the experimental approach to medicine while protecting the patient.<ref>Weindling, Paul. \"The origins of informed consent: The international scientific commission on medical war crimes, and the Nuremberg code\". ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 75.1 (2001): 37\u201371.</ref>\n\n==The ten points of the Nuremberg Code==\n\nThe ten points of the code were given in the section of the verdict entitled \"Permissible Medical Experiments\":<ref name=\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n# '''The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.'''\n# The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.\n# The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.\n# The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.\n# No experiment should be conducted where there is an ''a priori'' reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.\n# The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.\n# Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.\n# The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.\n# During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.\n# During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Authorship==\nThe Nuremberg Code was initially ignored, but gained much greater significance about 20 years after it was written. As a result, there were substantial rival claims for the creation of the Code. Some claimed that [[Harold Sebring]], one of the three U.S. judges who presided over the [[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]], was the author. [[Leo Alexander]], MD and [[Andrew Conway Ivy|Andrew Ivy]], MD, the prosecution's chief medical expert witnesses, were also each identified as authors. In his letter to [[Maurice Henry Pappworth|Maurice H. Pappworth]], an English physician and the author of the book ''[[Human Guinea Pigs]]'', Andrew Ivy claimed sole authorship of the Code. Leo Alexander, approximately 30 years after the trial, also claimed sole authorship.<ref name=\":0\">Gaw, Allan. \"Reality and revisionism: new evidence for Andrew C Ivy's claim to authorship of the Nuremberg Code.\" ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 107.4 (2014): 138-143.</ref> However, after careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors' Trial, background documents, and the final judgements, it is more accepted that the authorship was shared and the Code grew out of the trial itself.<ref>Shuster, Evelyne. \"Fifty years later: the significance of the Nuremberg Code.\" ''New England Journal of Medicine'' 337.20 (1997): 1436-1440.</ref>\n\nDr. Ravindra Ghooi from India has written a paper on this code and in his opinion, the code borrows heavily from the 1931 guidelines without acknowledging its source and thus could be considered plagiarized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghooi|first=Ravindra B.|date=2011|title=The Nuremberg Code\u2013A critique|journal=Perspectives in Clinical Research|volume=2|issue=2|pages=72\u201376|doi=10.4103/2229-3485.80371|issn=2229-3485|pmc=3121268|pmid=21731859}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Nuremberg Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association. In fact, the Code's reference to [[Hippocratic Oath|Hippocratic duty]] to the individual patient and the need to provide information was not initially favored by the [[American Medical Association]]. The Western world initially dismissed the Nuremberg Code as a \"code for barbarians\" and not for civilized physicians and investigators. Additionally, the final judgment did not specify whether the Nuremberg Code should be applied to cases such as [[political prisoner]]s, convicted felons, and healthy volunteers. The lack of clarity, the brutality of the unethical medical experiments, and the uncompromising language of the Nuremberg Code created an image that the Code was designed for singularly egregious transgressions.<ref>Katz, Jay. \"The Nuremberg code and the Nuremberg trial: A reappraisal.\" ''Jama'' 276.20 (1996): 1662-1666.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Code is considered to be the most important document in the history of [[clinical research ethics]], which had a massive influence on global human rights. The Nuremberg Code and the related [[Declaration of Helsinki]] are the basis for the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 45 Part 46,<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-03.html|title=Patients' rights: from Alder Hey to the Nuremberg Code|last=Hurren|first=Elizabeth|date=May 2002|publisher=History & Policy|location=[[United Kingdom]]|work=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/45cfr46_00.html|title=Public Welfare|date=2000-10-01|publisher=Access.gpo.gov|accessdate=2013-08-31}}</ref> which are the regulations issued by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] for the ethical treatment of human subjects, and are used in [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] (IRBs). In addition, the idea of [[informed consent]] has been universally accepted and now constitutes Article 7 of the United Nations' [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. It also served as the basis for [[International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]] proposed by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Belmont Report]]\n* [[Civil rights]]\n* [[Declaration of Geneva]]\n* [[Declaration of Helsinki]]\n* [[Good clinical practice]]\n* [[Green report]]\n* [[Hippocratic Oath]]\n* [[Human experimentation in the United States]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human subject research]]\n* [[Medical ethics]]\n* [[Medical torture]]\n* [[Nuremberg Principles]]\n* [[The Hague Ethical Guidelines]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[World Medical Association]]\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Weindling, Paul: ''Nazi Medicine and the Nuremberg Trials'' (Palgrave, Basingstoke 2004)\n*Schmidt, Ulf: ''Justice at Nuremberg: Leo Alexander and the Nazi Doctors' Trial'' (Palgrave, Basingstoke 2004)\n*Schmidt, Ulf: Karl Brandt.

The pre-war [[German Medical Association]] was considered to be a progressive yet democratic association with great concerns for public health, one example being the legislation of compulsory health insurance for German workers{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. However, starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of [[racial hygiene]], were accused by the public and the medical society of [[Unethical human experimentation|unethical]] medical practices. The use of racial hygiene was supported by the German government in order to create an Aryan \"master race\", and to exterminate those who did not fit into their criteria. Racial hygiene extremists merged with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] to promote the use of biology to accomplish their goals of racial purity, a core concept in the Nazi ideology. Physicians were attracted to the scientific ideology and aided in the establishment of National Socialist Physicians' League in 1929 to \"purify the German medical community of 'Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]]'.\" Criticism was becoming prevalent; Alfons Stauder, member of the Reich Health Office, claimed that the \"dubious experiments have no therapeutic purpose\", and Fredrich von Muller, physician and the president of the Deutsche Akademie, joined the criticism.<ref>Grodin MA.  \"Historical origins of the Nuremberg Code\".  In: ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code: Human Rights in Human Experimentation''. Annas, GJ and Grodin, MA (eds.). Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992.</ref>\n\nIn response to the criticism of unethical human experimentation, the Reich government issued \"Guidelines for New Therapy and Human Experimentation\" in [[Weimar]], Germany. The guidelines were based on [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]], but also stressed legal doctrine of [[informed consent]]. The guidelines clearly distinguished the difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. For therapeutic purposes, the guidelines allowed administration without consent only in dire situations, but for non-therapeutic purposes any administration without consent was strictly forbidden. However, the guidelines from Weimar were negated by [[Adolf Hitler]]. By 1942, the Nazi party included  more than 38,000 German physicians, who helped carry out medical programs such as [[Nazi eugenics|the Sterilization Law]].<ref>Vollmann, Jochen, and Rolf Winau. \"Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code\". ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'' 313.7070 (1996): 1445.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of [[war crime]]s. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman on May 2, 1945 and were led by the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. They began on November 20, 1945 in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, in what became known as the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In one of the trials, which became known as the \"[[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]]\", German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in [[concentration camps]], in addition to those who were involved in over 3,500,000 [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]s of German citizens.<ref name=\"Credo Refernece\">{{cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?ta=abcgeamrle&uh=eugenics_euthanasia |title=Eugenics/Euthanasia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |access-date=2013-09-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/The%20Nuremburg%20Code.htm</ref>\n\nSeveral of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from those used before the war, and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments. This worried Drs. Andrew Ivy and Leo Alexander, who worked with the prosecution during the trial. In April 1947, Dr. Alexander submitted a memorandum to the United States Counsel for War Crimes outlining six points for legitimate medical research.<ref name=\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\">{{cite web |title=Nuremberg Code |url=https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/doctors-trial/nuremberg-code |website=The Doctor's Trial: The Medical Case of the Subsequent Nuremberg Proceedings |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Online Exhibitions |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 1947, the judges delivered their verdict against [[Karl Brandt (physician)|Karl Brandt]] and 22 others.<ref name=\"Annas, George J. 1992\">Annas, George J., and Michael A. Grodin. ''The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992.</ref> The verdict reiterated the memorandum's points and, in response to expert medical advisers for the prosecution, revised the original six points to ten. The ten points became known as the \"Nuremberg Code\", which includes such principles as [[informed consent]] and absence of [[coercion]]; properly formulated [[scientific]] experimentation; and [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] towards experiment participants. It is thought to have been mainly based on the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which was interpreted as endorsing the experimental approach to medicine while protecting the patient.<ref>Weindling, Paul. \"The origins of informed consent: The international scientific commission on medical war crimes, and the Nuremberg code\". ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 75.1 (2001): 37\u201371.</ref>\n\n==The ten points of the Nuremberg Code==\n\nThe ten points of the code were given in the section of the verdict entitled \"Permissible Medical Experiments\":<ref name=\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n# The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.\n# The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.\n# The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.\n# The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.\n# No experiment should be conducted where there is an ''a priori'' reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.\n# The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.\n# Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.\n# The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.\n# During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.\n# During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Authorship==\nThe Nuremberg Code was initially ignored, but gained much greater significance about 20 years after it was written. As a result, there were substantial rival claims for the creation of the Code. Some claimed that [[Harold Sebring]], one of the three U.S. judges who presided over the [[Doctors' trial|Doctors' Trial]], was the author. [[Leo Alexander]], MD and [[Andrew Conway Ivy|Andrew Ivy]], MD, the prosecution's chief medical expert witnesses, were also each identified as authors. In his letter to [[Maurice Henry Pappworth|Maurice H. Pappworth]], an English physician and the author of the book ''[[Human Guinea Pigs]]'', Andrew Ivy claimed sole authorship of the Code. Leo Alexander, approximately 30 years after the trial, also claimed sole authorship.<ref name=\":0\">Gaw, Allan. \"Reality and revisionism: new evidence for Andrew C Ivy's claim to authorship of the Nuremberg Code.\" ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 107.4 (2014): 138-143.</ref> However, after careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors' Trial, background documents, and the final judgements, it is more accepted that the authorship was shared and the Code grew out of the trial itself.<ref>Shuster, Evelyne. \"Fifty years later: the significance of the Nuremberg Code.\" ''New England Journal of Medicine'' 337.20 (1997): 1436-1440.</ref>\n\nDr. Ravindra Ghooi from India has written a paper on this code and in his opinion, the code borrows heavily from the 1931 guidelines without acknowledging its source and thus could be considered plagiarized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghooi|first=Ravindra B.|date=2011|title=The Nuremberg Code\u2013A critique|journal=Perspectives in Clinical Research|volume=2|issue=2|pages=72\u201376|doi=10.4103/2229-3485.80371|issn=2229-3485|pmc=3121268|pmid=21731859}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Nuremberg Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association. In fact, the Code's reference to [[Hippocratic Oath|Hippocratic duty]] to the individual patient and the need to provide information was not initially favored by the [[American Medical Association]]. The Western world initially dismissed the Nuremberg Code as a \"code for barbarians\" and not for civilized physicians and investigators. Additionally, the final judgment did not specify whether the Nuremberg Code should be applied to cases such as [[political prisoner]]s, convicted felons, and healthy volunteers. The lack of clarity, the brutality of the unethical medical experiments, and the uncompromising language of the Nuremberg Code created an image that the Code was designed for singularly egregious transgressions.<ref>Katz, Jay. \"The Nuremberg code and the Nuremberg trial: A reappraisal.\" ''Jama'' 276.20 (1996): 1662-1666.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Code is considered to be the most important document in the history of [[clinical research ethics]], which had a massive influence on global human rights. The Nuremberg Code and the related [[Declaration of Helsinki]] are the basis for the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 45 Part 46,<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-03.html|title=Patients' rights: from Alder Hey to the Nuremberg Code|last=Hurren|first=Elizabeth|date=May 2002|publisher=History & Policy|location=[[United Kingdom]]|work=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/45cfr46_00.html|title=Public Welfare|date=2000-10-01|publisher=Access.gpo.gov|accessdate=2013-08-31}}</ref> which are the regulations issued by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] for the ethical treatment of human subjects, and are used in [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] (IRBs). In addition, the idea of [[informed consent]] has been universally accepted and now constitutes Article 7 of the United Nations' [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. It also served as the basis for [[International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]] proposed by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Belmont Report]]\n* [[Civil rights]]\n* [[Declaration of Geneva]]\n* [[Declaration of Helsinki]]\n* [[Good clinical practice]]\n* [[Green report]]\n* [[Hippocratic Oath]]\n* [[Human experimentation in the United States]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human subject research]]\n* [[Medical ethics]]\n* [[Medical torture]]\n* [[Nuremberg Principles]]\n* [[The Hague Ethical Guidelines]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[World Medical Association]]\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Weindling, Paul: ''Nazi Medicine and the Nuremberg Trials'' (Palgrave, Basingstoke 2004)\n*Schmidt, Ulf: ''Justice at Nuremberg: Leo Alexander and the Nazi Doctors' Trial'' (Palgrave, Basingstoke 2004)\n*Schmidt, Ulf: Karl Brandt.

A professional competitor since 2003, he has formerly competed for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]], the [[Legacy Fighting Alliance]], and was a competitor on [[Spike TV]]'s [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Bisping vs. Team Miller]]\n\n==Background==\nBedford was born and raised in [[Woodville, Ohio]]. At the age of five, Bedford began wrestling year round. He and his family would travel all over the Midwest so Bedford could compete in various wrestling tournaments. He went on to wrestle for [[Woodmore High School]], where his father was the head wrestling coach. Bedford was a three-time state qualifier, placed in the state tournament twice, and during his senior year finished third in the state tournament with a record of 51-1.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> After graduating from Woodmore he enrolled at [[Cleveland State University]]. At Cleveland State, Bedford was on the wrestling team for a year and a half before he was removed from the school (as well as the wrestling squad) before later making the transition to a career in [[mixed martial arts]].<ref name=\"Bio\">[http://www.brutaljohnnybedford.com/career.html Official Johnny Bedford Website, BRUTAL Johnny Bedford]. Brutaljohnnybedford.com (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-12-08.</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Amateur career===\nBedford began fighting in 2003 because he was a self-proclaimed \"tough guy\" that just wanted to prove how tough he was. Bedford proclaims his first six amateur fights took place in a barn where the promoter just asked the audience who wanted to fight and then would match them up by who was closest to one another's weight. With no commission in Ohio at the time, the fights were not sanctioned.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2011-09-21/johnny-bedfore-the-ultimate-fighter-interview/548200/1 'TUF' 14: Meet bantamweight hopeful Johnny Bedford]. Usatoday.com (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-12-08.</ref>\n\n===Early professional career===\nAfter a successful amateur career, Bedford took a year and half off from fighting before being offered his first professional fight in 2006 for $200. With no income, Bedford took the fight on short notice and lost via submission in the first round. Bedford began fighting more frequently and by the end of 2009 Bedford held a 13\u20138\u20131 record.\n\n===Bellator===\nBedford was invited to fight for [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]] in 2010. The fight took place at [[Bellator 19]] in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]] on May 20, 2010. Bedford fought and defeated Jared Lopez via third-round TKO.\n\n===Post-Bellator===\nAt King of Kombat 9: Resurrection, Bedford fought future UFC fighter, [[Edwin Figueroa]]. Bedford lost the fight via TKO in the opening of the second round, handing Bedford his only knockout loss in his career. Four months later he bounced back with a first round submission over [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]] veteran [[Frank Gomez]].\n\n===The Ultimate Fighter===\nIn 2011, Bedford had signed with the UFC to compete on [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Bisping vs. Team Miller]]. In the first episode, Bedford fought Carson Beebe to gain entry into the ''Ultimate Fighter'' house. Bedford defeated Beebe in the first round via submission (neck crank). He was selected as a part of Team Mayhem.\n\nBedford then fought Josh Ferguson in the third episode and won by unanimous decision after using his superior size to take down and control Ferguson.\n\nIn the semi-finals Bedford pleaded for the fight against Team Mayhem teammate, [[John Dodson (fighter)|John Dodson]]. The coaches and [[Dana White]] agreed with the fight, and matched the two up. After a closely contested first round, Bedford lost after being knocked unconscious one minute into round two. When asked if he knew where he was immediately after the fight, Bedford replied, \"I'm in Ohio\"; his home state.\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nThough he did not win the show, Bedford signed an exclusive contract with the UFC. He officially made his UFC debut on December 3, 2011 at [[The Ultimate Fighter 14 Finale]] against ''Ultimate Fighter'' castmate [[Louis Gaudinot]]. Bedford dominated the entirety of the fight and won in the third round via TKO after hitting several knees to Gaudinot's body.\n\nBedford was expected to face [[Eddie Wineland]] on January 28, 2012 at [[UFC on Fox 2]], replacing [[Demetrious Johnson (fighter)|Demetrious Johnson]] who had been pulled from the bout to be a participant in the UFC's inaugural [[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]

A professional competitor since 2003, he has formerly competed for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]], the [[Legacy Fighting Alliance]], and was a competitor on [[Spike TV]]'s [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Bisping vs. Team Miller]]\n\n==Background==\nBedford was born and raised in [[Woodville, Ohio]]. At the age of five, Bedford began wrestling year round. He and his family would travel all over the Midwest so Bedford could compete in various wrestling tournaments. He went on to wrestle for [[Woodmore High School]], where his father was the head wrestling coach. Bedford was a three-time state qualifier, placed in the state tournament twice, and during his senior year finished third in the state tournament with a record of 51-1.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> After graduating from Woodmore he enrolled at [[Cleveland State University]]. At Cleveland State, Bedford was on the wrestling team for a year and a half before he was removed from the school (as well as the wrestling squad) before later making the transition to a career in [[mixed martial arts]].<ref name=\"Bio\">[http://www.brutaljohnnybedford.com/career.html Official Johnny Bedford Website, BRUTAL Johnny Bedford]. Brutaljohnnybedford.com (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-12-08.</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Amateur career===\nBedford began fighting in 2003 because he was a self-proclaimed \"tough guy\" that just wanted to prove how tough he was. Bedford proclaims his first six amateur fights took place in a barn where the promoter just asked the audience who wanted to fight and then would match them up by who was closest to one another's weight. With no commission in Ohio at the time, the fights were not sanctioned.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2011-09-21/johnny-bedfore-the-ultimate-fighter-interview/548200/1 'TUF' 14: Meet bantamweight hopeful Johnny Bedford]. Usatoday.com (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-12-08.</ref>\n\n===Early professional career===\nAfter a successful amateur career, Bedford took a year and half off from fighting before being offered his first professional fight in 2006 for $200. With no income, Bedford took the fight on short notice and lost via submission in the first round. Bedford began fighting more frequently and by the end of 2009 Bedford held a 13\u20138\u20131 record.\n\n===Bellator===\nBedford was invited to fight for [[Bellator MMA|Bellator]] in 2010. The fight took place at [[Bellator 19]] in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]] on May 20, 2010. Bedford fought and defeated Jared Lopez via third-round TKO.\n\n===Post-Bellator===\nAt King of Kombat 9: Resurrection, Bedford fought future UFC fighter, [[Edwin Figueroa]]. Bedford lost the fight via TKO in the opening of the second round, handing Bedford his only knockout loss in his career. Four months later he bounced back with a first round submission over [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]] veteran [[Frank Gomez]].\n\n===The Ultimate Fighter===\nIn 2011, Bedford had signed with the UFC to compete on [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Bisping vs. Team Miller]]. In the first episode, Bedford fought Carson Beebe to gain entry into the ''Ultimate Fighter'' house. Bedford defeated Beebe in the first round via submission (neck crank). He was selected as a part of Team Mayhem.\n\nBedford then fought Josh Ferguson in the third episode and won by unanimous decision after using his superior size to take down and control Ferguson.\n\nIn the semi-finals Bedford pleaded for the fight against Team Mayhem teammate, [[John Dodson (fighter)|John Dodson]]. The coaches and [[Dana White]] agreed with the fight, and matched the two up. After a closely contested first round, Bedford lost after being knocked unconscious one minute into round two. When asked if he knew where he was immediately after the fight, Bedford replied, \"I'm in Ohio\"; his homestate.\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nThough he did not win the show, Bedford signed an exclusive contract with the UFC. He officially made his UFC debut on December 3, 2011 at [[The Ultimate Fighter 14 Finale]] against ''Ultimate Fighter'' castmate [[Louis Gaudinot]]. Bedford dominated the entirety of the fight and won in the third round via TKO after hitting several knees to Gaudinot's body.\n\nBedford was expected to face [[Eddie Wineland]] on January 28, 2012 at [[UFC on Fox 2]], replacing [[Demetrious Johnson (fighter)|Demetrious Johnson]] who had been pulled from the bout to be a participant in the UFC's inaugural [[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]
