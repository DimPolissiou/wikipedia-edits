The project comprised two 15&nbsp;km-long, 2-4 lane concentric ring tunnels around the central business district, with 8 interchanges and 33 entrances and exits.

This comes after enhancements to the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) network and changes to land use policies over the years since the project's conceptualisation. As a result, land safeguarded for the project since 1993 was freed up for other developmental purposes, allowing for greater flexibility by developers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-scraps-underground-road-network-plans |title=Singapore scraps underground road network plans |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=29 August 2017 |date=29 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Expressways of Singapore}}\n{{Singapore-road-stub}}\n[[Category:2017 disestablishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Transport in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Downtown Core (Singapore)]]\n[[Category:Kallang]]\n[[Category:Novena]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Singapore Underground Road System''', '''SURS''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5730\u4e0b\u9053\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Sistem Jalan Bawah Tanah Singapura'') was a proposed road underground system in [[Singapore]].
