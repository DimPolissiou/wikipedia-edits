In many instances they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. Digital signatures can also provide [[non-repudiation]], meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their [[private key]] remains secret. Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.{{Citation needed|reason= How?|date=December 2019}} Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a [[bitstring]]: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other [[cryptographic protocol]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{Main|Public-key cryptography}}\nA digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms;\n* A ''[[key generation]]'' algorithm that selects a ''private key'' [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]] from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding ''public key''.\n* A ''signing'' algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.\n* A ''signature verifying'' algorithm that, given the message, public key and signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.\n\nTwo main properties are required. First, the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key. Secondly, it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party's private key.\nA digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that acts as a signature. \nThe [[Digital Signature Algorithm]] (DSA), developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], is one of [[Digital signature#Some digital signature algorithms|many examples]] of a signing algorithm.\n\nIn the following discussion, 1<sup>''n''</sup> refers to a [[Unary numeral system|unary number]].\n\nFormally, a '''digital signature scheme''' is a triple of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms, (''G'', ''S'', ''V''), satisfying:\n* ''G'' (key-generator) generates a public key (''pk''), and a corresponding private key (''sk''), on input 1<sup>''n''</sup>, where ''n'' is the security parameter.\n* ''S'' (signing) returns a tag, ''t'', on the inputs: the private key (''sk''), and a string (''x'').\n* ''V'' (verifying) outputs ''accepted'' or ''rejected'' on the inputs: the public key (''pk''), a string (''x''), and a tag (''t''). \nFor correctness, ''S'' and ''V'' must satisfy\n\n: Pr [ (''pk'', ''sk'') \u2190 ''G''(1<sup>''n''</sup>), ''V''( ''pk'', ''x'', ''S''(''sk'', ''x'') ) = ''accepted'' ] = 1.<ref>Pass, def 135.1</ref>\n\nA digital signature scheme is '''secure''' if for every non-uniform probabilistic polynomial time [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]], ''A''\n\n: Pr [ (''pk'', ''sk'') \u2190 ''G''(1<sup>''n''</sup>), (''x'', ''t'') \u2190 ''A''<sup>''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 )</sup>(''pk'', 1<sup>''n''</sup>), ''x'' \u2209 ''Q'', ''V''(''pk'', ''x'', ''t'') = ''accepted''] < [[Negligible function|negl]](''n''),\n\nwhere ''A''<sup>''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 )</sup> denotes that ''A'' has access to the [[Oracle machine|oracle]], ''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 ), ''Q'' denotes the set of the queries on ''S'' made by ''A'', which knows the public key, ''pk'', and the security parameter, ''n'', and ''x'' \u2209 ''Q'' denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string, ''x'', on ''S''.<ref>Goldreich's FoC, vol. 2, def 6.1.2.

STOC 1989: 33\u201343</ref>\n\n==Method==\nOne digital signature scheme (of many) is based on RSA. To create signature keys, generate a RSA key pair containing a modulus, ''N'', that is the product of two random secret distinct large primes, along with integers, ''e'' and ''d'', such that ''e''&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;[[Modular arithmetic|\u2261]]&nbsp;1&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''\u03c6''(''N'')), where ''\u03c6'' is the [[Euler's totient function|Euler phi-function]]. The signer's public key consists of ''N'' and ''e'', and the signer's secret key contains ''d''.\n\nTo sign a message, ''m'', the signer computes a signature, ''\u03c3'', such that ''\u03c3''&nbsp;\u2261 &nbsp;''m''<sup>''d''</sup> (mod&nbsp;''N''). To verify, the receiver checks that ''\u03c3''<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''N'').\n\nSeveral early signature schemes were of a similar type: they involve the use of a [[trapdoor permutation]], such as the RSA function, or in the case of the Rabin signature scheme, computing square modulo composite,&nbsp;''N''. A trapdoor permutation family is a family of [[permutation]]s, specified by a parameter, that is easy to compute in the forward direction, but is difficult to compute in the reverse direction without already knowing the private key (\"trapdoor\").  Trapdoor permutations can be used for digital signature schemes, where computing the reverse direction with the secret key is required for signing, and computing the forward direction is used to verify signatures.\n\nUsed directly, this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to key-only existential forgery attack. To create a forgery, the attacker picks a random signature \u03c3 and uses the verification procedure to determine the message, ''m'', corresponding to that signature.<ref>\"Modern Cryptography: Theory & Practice\", Wenbo Mao, Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference, New Jersey, 2004, pg. 308.  {{ISBN|0-13-066943-1}}</ref> In practice, however, this type of signature is not used directly, but rather, the message to be signed is first [[cryptographic hash function|hashed]] to produce a short digest, that is then [[Padding (cryptography)#Public key cryptography|padded]] to larger width comparable to&nbsp;''N'', then signed with the reverse trapdoor function.<ref>Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone. Fifth Printing (August 2001) page 445.</ref> This forgery attack, then, only produces the padded hash function output that corresponds to \u03c3, but not a message that leads to that value, which does not lead to an attack. In the random oracle model, [[Full domain hash|hash-then-sign]] (an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to ''N'' possible outputs), this form of signature is existentially unforgeable, even against a [[chosen-plaintext attack]].<ref name=lysythesis />{{Clarify|reason=Please give a page number or theorem number.|date=September 2010}}\n\nThere are several reasons to sign such a hash (or message digest) instead of the whole document.\n\n;For efficiency: The signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice.\n;For compatibility: Messages are typically bit strings, but some signature schemes operate on other domains (such as, in the case of RSA, numbers modulo a composite number ''N''). A hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format.\n;For integrity: Without the hash function, the text \"to be signed\" may have to be split (separated) in blocks small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly. However, the receiver of the signed blocks is not able to recognize if all the blocks are present and in the appropriate order.\n\n==Notions of security==\nIn their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:<ref name=\"SJC 17(2)\"/>\n\n# In a ''key-only'' attack, the attacker is only given the public verification key.\n# In a ''known message'' attack, the attacker is given valid signatures for a variety of messages known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker.\n# In an ''adaptive chosen message'' attack, the attacker first learns signatures on arbitrary messages of the attacker's choice.\n\nThey also describe a hierarchy of attack results:<ref name=\"SJC 17(2)\"/>\n\n# A ''total break'' results in the recovery of the signing key.\n# A [[universal forgery]] attack results in the ability to forge signatures for any message.\n# A [[selective forgery]] attack results in a signature on a message of the adversary's choice.\n# An [[existential forgery]] merely results in some valid message/signature pair not already known to the adversary.\n\nThe strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.\n\n==Applications==\n\nAs organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps, digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance, identity, and status of an [[electronic document]] as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory.  The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) publishes electronic versions of the budget, public and private laws, and congressional bills with digital signatures.  Universities including Penn State, [[University of Chicago]], and Stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures.\n\nBelow are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:\n\n===Authentication===\nAlthough messages may often include information about the entity sending a message, that information may not be accurate.  Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages. When ownership of a digital signature secret key is bound to a specific user, a valid signature shows that the message was sent by that user. The importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose a bank's branch office sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly sent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a grave mistake.\n\n===Integrity===\nIn many scenarios, the sender and receiver of a message may have a need for confidence that the message has not been altered during transmission. Although encryption hides the contents of a message, it may be possible to {{em|change}} an encrypted message without understanding it. (Some encryption algorithms, known as [[Malleability (cryptography)|nonmalleable]] ones, prevent this, but others do not.) However, if a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after signature invalidates the signature. Furthermore, there is no efficient way to modify a message and its signature to produce a new message with a valid signature, because this is still considered to be computationally infeasible by most cryptographic hash functions (see [[collision resistance]]).\n\n===Non-repudiation===\n[[Non-repudiation]],<ref name=\"Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig\" /> or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.\n\nNote that these authentication, non-repudiation etc. properties rely on the secret key {{em|not having been revoked}} prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is a required ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an \"online\" check; e.g., checking a [[certificate revocation list]] or via the [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]].<ref name=\"CryptomathicDigSigServicesAshiqJA\" />  Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first checking online with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen. Of course, with stolen key pairs, the theft is often discovered only after the secret key's use, e.g., to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose.\n\n==Additional security precautions==\n\n===Putting the private key on a smart card===\nAll public key / private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret. A private key can be stored on a user's computer, and protected by a local password, but this has two disadvantages:\n\n* the user can only sign documents on that particular computer\n* the security of the private key depends entirely on the [[computer insecurity|security]] of the computer\n\nA more secure alternative is to store the private key on a [[smart card]]. Many smart cards are designed to be tamper-resistant (although some designs have been broken, notably by [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]] and his students<ref>[http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/users/smurdoch/papers/oakland14chipandskim.pdf Chip and Skim: cloning EMV cards with the pre-play attack]</ref>). In a typical digital signature implementation, the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU signs the hash using the stored private key of the user, and then returns the signed hash. Typically, a user must activate his smart card by entering a [[personal identification number]] or PIN code (thus providing [[two-factor authentication]]). It can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card, although this is not always implemented. If the smart card is stolen, the thief will still need the PIN code to generate a digital signature. This reduces the security of the scheme to that of the PIN system, although it still requires an attacker to possess the card. A mitigating factor is that private keys, if generated and stored on smart cards, are usually regarded as difficult to copy, and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy. Thus, the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked. Private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy, and such compromises are far more difficult to detect.\n\n===Using smart card readers with a separate keyboard===\nEntering a PIN code to activate the smart card commonly requires a [[numeric keypad]]. Some card readers have their own numeric keypad. This is safer than using a card reader integrated into a PC, and then entering the PIN using that computer's keyboard. Readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a [[keystroke logging|keystroke logger]], potentially compromising the PIN code. Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often [[Evaluation Assurance Level|EAL3]] certified.\n\n===Other smart card designs===\nSmart card design is an active field, and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems, though so far with little security proofs.\n\n===Using digital signatures only with trusted applications===\nOne of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not \"see\" what he signs. The user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key. An attacker who gains control of the user's PC can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute, in effect replacing the user's own communications with those of the attacker. This could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user's original on-screen, but presenting the attacker's own documents to the signing application.\n\nTo protect against this scenario, an authentication system can be set up between the user's application (word processor, email client, etc.) and the signing application. The general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each other's integrity. For example, the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries.\n\n===Using a network attached hardware security module===\nOne of the main differences between a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk.  Many risk averse companies, including governments, financial and medical institutions,  and payment processors require more secure standards, like [[FIPS 140-2]] level 3 and [[FIPS 201]] certification, to ensure the signature is validated and secure. <!--To finish: current and future applications, actual algorithms, standards, why not as adopted as widely as expected, etc.-->\n\n===WYSIWYS===\n{{Main|WYSIWYS}}\nTechnically speaking, a digital signature applies to a string of bits, whereas humans and applications \"believe\" that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits. In order to be semantically interpreted, the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system. The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content. It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign)<ref name=WYSIWYS_SeminalPaper>{{cite journal|last1=Landrock|first1=Peter|last2=Pedersen|first2=Torben|title=WYSIWYS? \u2013 What you see is what you sign?|journal=Information Security Technical Report|date=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=55\u201361|doi=10.1016/S0167-4048(98)80005-8}}</ref> means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed. In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of, and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. WYSIWYS is a requirement for the validity of digital signatures, but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems. The term WYSIWYS was coined by [[Peter Landrock]] and [[Cryptomathic|Torben Pedersen]] to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for Pan-European projects.<ref name=WYSIWYS_SeminalPaper />\n\n===Digital signatures versus ink on paper signatures===\n\nAn ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally, but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill, and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult.\n\nDigital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document. Paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page, and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied.  Digital signatures can be applied to an entire document, such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered, but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract.\n\n==Some digital signature algorithms==\n*[[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based signature schemes, such as [[RSA-PSS]]\n*[[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] and its [[elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve]] variant [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]]\n*[[EdDSA|Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] and its [[EdDSA#Ed25519|Ed25519]] variant.\n*[[ElGamal signature scheme]] as the predecessor to DSA, and variants [[Schnorr signature]] and [[Pointcheval\u2013Stern signature algorithm]]\n*[[Rabin signature algorithm]]\n*[[Pairing]]-based schemes such as [[Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham|BLS]]\n*[[NTRUSign]] is an example of a digital signature scheme based on hard lattice problems\n*[[Undeniable signature]]s\n*{{Iw2|Aggregate signature||ru|\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c}} \u2013 a signature scheme that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n messages from n users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of users. This single signature will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages. A scheme by [[Mihir Bellare]] and [[Gregory Neven]] may be used with [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Technology roadmap \u2013 Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation|url=https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/|website=bitcoincore.org|publisher=Bitcoin Core|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Signatures with efficient protocols]] \u2013 are signature schemes that facilitate efficient cryptographic protocols such as [[zero-knowledge proofs]] or [[secure computation]].\n\n==The current state of use &ndash; legal and practical==\n{{Globalize|section|date=November 2009}}\nAll digital signature schemes share the following basic prerequisites regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision:\n\n#;Quality algorithms: Some public-key algorithms are known to be insecure, as practical attacks against them having been discovered.\n#\n#; Quality implementations: An implementation of a good algorithm (or [[cryptographic protocol|protocol]]) with mistake(s) will not work.\n#\n#; Users (and their software) must carry out the signature protocol properly.\n#\n#; The private key must remain private: If the private key becomes known to any other party, that party can produce ''perfect'' digital signatures of anything whatsoever.\n#\n#; The public key owner must be verifiable: A public key associated with Bob actually came from Bob. This is commonly done using a [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) and the public key\u2194user association is attested by the operator of the PKI (called a [[certificate authority]]). For 'open' PKIs in which anyone can request such an attestation (universally embodied in a cryptographically protected [[identity certificate]]), the possibility of mistaken attestation is non-trivial. Commercial PKI operators have suffered several publicly known problems. Such mistakes could lead to falsely signed, and thus wrongly attributed, documents. 'Closed' PKI systems are more expensive, but less easily subverted in this way.\n\nOnly if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message, and therefore of their assent to its contents. Legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities, though some such have not reflected this actuality.\n\nLegislatures, being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI, or by the technological avant-garde advocating new solutions to old problems, have enacted statutes and/or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing, endorsing, encouraging, or permitting digital signatures and providing for (or limiting) their legal effect. The first appears to have been in [[Utah]] in the United States, followed closely by the states [[Massachusetts]] and [[California]]. Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time. These enactments (or proposed enactments) vary from place to place, have typically embodied expectations at variance (optimistically or pessimistically) with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering, and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers, nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable. Adoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation, delaying a more or less unified engineering position on [[interoperability]], [[algorithm]] choice, [[key length]]s, and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide.\n\n{{see also|ABA digital signature guidelines}}\n\n==Industry standards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSome industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between members of the industry and with regulators.  These include the [[Automotive Network Exchange]] for the automobile industry and the [[SAFE-BioPharma Association]] for the [[healthcare industry]].\n\n===Using separate key pairs for signing and encryption===\nIn several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature, as in the \n[[Electronic Signatures Directive|1999 EU digital signature directive]] and [[EIDAS|2014 EU follow-on legislation]].<ref name=Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig /> Generally, these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair, a person can engage in an encrypted conversation (e.g., regarding a real estate transaction), but the encryption does not legally sign every message she or he sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the encrypted link.  If a signing key is lost or compromised, it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions.  If an encryption key is lost, a backup or [[key escrow]] should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content.  Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed unless the backup destination is securely encrypted.\n\n==See also==\n* [[21 CFR 11]]\n* [[X.509]]\n* [[Advanced electronic signature]]\n* [[Blind signature]]\n* [[Detached signature]]\n* [[Digital certificate]]\n* [[Digital signature in Estonia]]\n* [[Electronic lab notebook]]\n* [[Electronic signature]]\n* [[Electronic signatures and law]]\n* [[eSign (India)]]\n* [[GNU Privacy Guard]]\n* [[Public key infrastructure]]\n* [[Server-based signatures]]\n* [[Probabilistic signature scheme]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last1=Goldreich|first1=Oded|title=Foundations of cryptography I: Basic Tools|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-54689-1}}\n*{{citation|last1=Goldreich|first1=Oded|title=Foundations of cryptography II: Basic Applications|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

In many instances they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. Digital signatures can also provide [[non-repudiation]], meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their [[private key]] remains secret. Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.{{Citation needed|reason= How?|date=December 2019}} Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a [[bitstring]]: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other [[cryptographic protocol]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{Main|Public-key cryptography}}\nA digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms;\n* A ''[[key generation]]'' algorithm that selects a ''private key'' [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]] from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding ''public key''.\n* A ''signing'' algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.\n* A ''signature verifying'' algorithm that, given the message, public key and signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.\n\nTwo main properties are required. First, the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key. Secondly, it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party's private key.\nA digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that acts as a signature. \nThe [[Digital Signature Algorithm]] (DSA), developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], is one of [[Digital signature#Some digital signature algorithms|many examples]] of a signing algorithm.\n\nIn the following discussion, 1<sup>''n''</sup> refers to a [[Unary numeral system|unary number]].\n\nFormally, a '''digital signature scheme''' is a triple of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms, (''G'', ''S'', ''V''), satisfying:\n* ''G'' (key-generator) generates a public key (''pk''), and a corresponding private key (''sk''), on input 1<sup>''n''</sup>, where ''n'' is the security parameter.\n* ''S'' (signing) returns a tag, ''t'', on the inputs: the private key (''sk''), and a string (''x'').\n* ''V'' (verifying) outputs ''accepted'' or ''rejected'' on the inputs: the public key (''pk''), a string (''x''), and a tag (''t''). \nFor correctness, ''S'' and ''V'' must satisfy\n\n: Pr [ (''pk'', ''sk'') \u2190 ''G''(1<sup>''n''</sup>), ''V''( ''pk'', ''x'', ''S''(''sk'', ''x'') ) = ''accepted'' ] = 1.<ref>Pass, def 135.1</ref>\n\nA digital signature scheme is '''secure''' if for every non-uniform probabilistic polynomial time [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]], ''A''\n\n: Pr [ (''pk'', ''sk'') \u2190 ''G''(1<sup>''n''</sup>), (''x'', ''t'') \u2190 ''A''<sup>''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 )</sup>(''pk'', 1<sup>''n''</sup>), ''x'' \u2209 ''Q'', ''V''(''pk'', ''x'', ''t'') = ''accepted''] < [[Negligible function|negl]](''n''),\n\nwhere ''A''<sup>''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 )</sup> denotes that ''A'' has access to the [[Oracle machine|oracle]], ''S''(''sk'', \u00b7 ), ''Q'' denotes the set of the queries on ''S'' made by ''A'', which knows the public key, ''pk'', and the security parameter, ''n'', and ''x'' \u2209 ''Q'' denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string, ''x'', on ''S''.<ref>Goldreich's FoC, vol. 2, def 6.1.2.

STOC 1989: 33\u201343</ref>\n\n==Method==\nOne digital signature scheme (of many) is based on RSA. To create signature keys, generate a RSA key pair containing a modulus, ''N'', that is the product of two random secret distinct large primes, along with integers, ''e'' and ''d'', such that ''e''&nbsp;''d''&nbsp;[[Modular arithmetic|\u2261]]&nbsp;1&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''\u03c6''(''N'')), where ''\u03c6'' is the [[Euler's totient function|Euler phi-function]]. The signer's public key consists of ''N'' and ''e'', and the signer's secret key contains ''d''.\n\nTo sign a message, ''m'', the signer computes a signature, ''\u03c3'', such that ''\u03c3''&nbsp;\u2261 &nbsp;''m''<sup>''d''</sup> (mod&nbsp;''N''). To verify, the receiver checks that ''\u03c3''<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''N'').\n\nSeveral early signature schemes were of a similar type: they involve the use of a [[trapdoor permutation]], such as the RSA function, or in the case of the Rabin signature scheme, computing square modulo composite,&nbsp;''N''. A trapdoor permutation family is a family of [[permutation]]s, specified by a parameter, that is easy to compute in the forward direction, but is difficult to compute in the reverse direction without already knowing the private key (\"trapdoor\").  Trapdoor permutations can be used for digital signature schemes, where computing the reverse direction with the secret key is required for signing, and computing the forward direction is used to verify signatures.\n\nUsed directly, this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to key-only existential forgery attack. To create a forgery, the attacker picks a random signature \u03c3 and uses the verification procedure to determine the message, ''m'', corresponding to that signature.<ref>\"Modern Cryptography: Theory & Practice\", Wenbo Mao, Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference, New Jersey, 2004, pg. 308.  {{ISBN|0-13-066943-1}}</ref> In practice, however, this type of signature is not used directly, but rather, the message to be signed is first [[cryptographic hash function|hashed]] to produce a short digest, that is then [[Padding (cryptography)#Public key cryptography|padded]] to larger width comparable to&nbsp;''N'', then signed with the reverse trapdoor function.<ref>Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone. Fifth Printing (August 2001) page 445.</ref> This forgery attack, then, only produces the padded hash function output that corresponds to \u03c3, but not a message that leads to that value, which does not lead to an attack. In the random oracle model, [[Full domain hash|hash-then-sign]] (an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to ''N'' possible outputs), this form of signature is existentially unforgeable, even against a [[chosen-plaintext attack]].<ref name=lysythesis />{{Clarify|reason=Please give a page number or theorem number.|date=September 2010}}\n\nThere are several reasons to sign such a hash (or message digest) instead of the whole document.\n\n;For efficiency: The signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice.\n;For compatibility: Messages are typically bit strings, but some signature schemes operate on other domains (such as, in the case of RSA, numbers modulo a composite number ''N''). A hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format.\n;For integrity: Without the hash function, the text \"to be signed\" may have to be split (separated) in blocks small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly. However, the receiver of the signed blocks is not able to recognize if all the blocks are present and in the appropriate order.\n\n==Notions of security==\nIn their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:<ref name=\"SJC 17(2)\"/>\n\n# In a ''key-only'' attack, the attacker is only given the public verification key.\n# In a ''known message'' attack, the attacker is given valid signatures for a variety of messages known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker.\n# In an ''adaptive chosen message'' attack, the attacker first learns signatures on arbitrary messages of the attacker's choice.\n\nThey also describe a hierarchy of attack results:<ref name=\"SJC 17(2)\"/>\n\n# A ''total break'' results in the recovery of the signing key.\n# A [[universal forgery]] attack results in the ability to forge signatures for any message.\n# A [[selective forgery]] attack results in a signature on a message of the adversary's choice.\n# An [[existential forgery]] merely results in some valid message/signature pair not already known to the adversary.\n\nThe strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.\n\n==Applications==\n\nAs organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps, digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance, identity, and status of an [[electronic document]] as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory.  The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) publishes electronic versions of the budget, public and private laws, and congressional bills with digital signatures.  Universities including Penn State, [[University of Chicago]], and Stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures.\n\nBelow are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:\n\n===Authentication===\nAlthough messages may often include information about the entity sending a message, that information may not be accurate.  Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages. When ownership of a digital signature secret key is bound to a specific user, a valid signature shows that the message was sent by that user. The importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose a bank's branch office sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly sent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a grave mistake.\n\n===Integrity===\nIn many scenarios, the sender and receiver of a message may have a need for confidence that the message has not been altered during transmission. Although encryption hides the contents of a message, it may be possible to {{em|change}} an encrypted message without understanding it. (Some encryption algorithms, known as [[Malleability (cryptography)|nonmalleable]] ones, prevent this, but others do not.) However, if a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after signature invalidates the signature. Furthermore, there is no efficient way to modify a message and its signature to produce a new message with a valid signature, because this is still considered to be computationally infeasible by most cryptographic hash functions (see [[collision resistance]]).\n\n===Non-repudiation===\n[[Non-repudiation]],<ref name=\"Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig\" /> or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.\n\nNote that these authentication, non-repudiation etc. properties rely on the secret key {{em|not having been revoked}} prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is a required ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an \"online\" check; e.g., checking a [[certificate revocation list]] or via the [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]].<ref name=\"CryptomathicDigSigServicesAshiqJA\" />  Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first checking online with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen. Of course, with stolen key pairs, the theft is often discovered only after the secret key's use, e.g., to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose.\n\n==Additional security precautions==\n\n===Putting the private key on a smart card===\nAll public key / private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret. A private key can be stored on a user's computer, and protected by a local password, but this has two disadvantages:\n\n* the user can only sign documents on that particular computer\n* the security of the private key depends entirely on the [[computer insecurity|security]] of the computer\n\nA more secure alternative is to store the private key on a [[smart card]]. Many smart cards are designed to be tamper-resistant (although some designs have been broken, notably by [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]] and his students<ref>[http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/users/smurdoch/papers/oakland14chipandskim.pdf Chip and Skim: cloning EMV cards with the pre-play attack]</ref>). In a typical digital signature implementation, the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU signs the hash using the stored private key of the user, and then returns the signed hash. Typically, a user must activate his smart card by entering a [[personal identification number]] or PIN code (thus providing [[two-factor authentication]]). It can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card, although this is not always implemented. If the smart card is stolen, the thief will still need the PIN code to generate a digital signature. This reduces the security of the scheme to that of the PIN system, although it still requires an attacker to possess the card. A mitigating factor is that private keys, if generated and stored on smart cards, are usually regarded as difficult to copy, and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy. Thus, the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked. Private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy, and such compromises are far more difficult to detect.\n\n===Using smart card readers with a separate keyboard===\nEntering a PIN code to activate the smart card commonly requires a [[numeric keypad]]. Some card readers have their own numeric keypad. This is safer than using a card reader integrated into a PC, and then entering the PIN using that computer's keyboard. Readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a [[keystroke logging|keystroke logger]], potentially compromising the PIN code. Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often [[Evaluation Assurance Level|EAL3]] certified.\n\n===Other smart card designs===\nSmart card design is an active field, and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems, though so far with little security proofs.\n\n===Using digital signatures only with trusted applications===\nOne of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not \"see\" what he signs. The user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key. An attacker who gains control of the user's PC can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute, in effect replacing the user's own communications with those of the attacker. This could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user's original on-screen, but presenting the attacker's own documents to the signing application.\n\nTo protect against this scenario, an authentication system can be set up between the user's application (word processor, email client, etc.) and the signing application. The general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each other's integrity. For example, the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries.\n\n===Using a network attached hardware security module===\nOne of the main differences between a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk.  Many risk averse companies, including governments, financial and medical institutions,  and payment processors require more secure standards, like [[FIPS 140-2]] level 3 and [[FIPS 201]] certification, to ensure the signature is validated and secure. <!--To finish: current and future applications, actual algorithms, standards, why not as adopted as widely as expected, etc.-->\n\n===WYSIWYS===\n{{Main|WYSIWYS}}\nTechnically speaking, a digital signature applies to a string of bits, whereas humans and applications \"believe\" that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits. In order to be semantically interpreted, the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system. The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content. It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign)<ref name=WYSIWYS_SeminalPaper>{{cite journal|last1=Landrock|first1=Peter|last2=Pedersen|first2=Torben|title=WYSIWYS? \u2013 What you see is what you sign?|journal=Information Security Technical Report|date=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=55\u201361|doi=10.1016/S0167-4048(98)80005-8}}</ref> means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed. In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of, and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. WYSIWYS is a requirement for the validity of digital signatures, but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems. The term WYSIWYS was coined by [[Peter Landrock]] and [[Cryptomathic|Torben Pedersen]] to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for Pan-European projects.<ref name=WYSIWYS_SeminalPaper />\n\n===Digital signatures versus ink on paper signatures===\n\nAn ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally, but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill, and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult.\n\nDigital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document. Paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page, and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied.  Digital signatures can be applied to an entire document, such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered, but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract.\n\n==Some digital signature algorithms==\n*[[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based signature schemes, such as [[RSA-PSS]]\n*[[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] and its [[elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve]] variant [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]]\n*[[EdDSA|Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] and its [[EdDSA#Ed25519|Ed25519]] variant.\n*[[ElGamal signature scheme]] as the predecessor to DSA, and variants [[Schnorr signature]] and [[Pointcheval\u2013Stern signature algorithm]]\n*[[Rabin signature algorithm]]\n*[[Pairing]]-based schemes such as [[Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham|BLS]]\n*[[NTRUSign]] is an example of a digital signature scheme based on hard lattice problems\n*[[Undeniable signature]]s\n*{{Iw2|Aggregate signature||ru|\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c}} \u2013 a signature scheme that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n messages from n users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of users.

A scheme by [[Mihir Bellare]] and [[Gregory Neven]] may be used with [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Technology roadmap \u2013 Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation|url=https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/|website=bitcoincore.org|publisher=Bitcoin Core|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Signatures with efficient protocols]] \u2013 are signature schemes that facilitate efficient cryptographic protocols such as [[zero-knowledge proofs]] or [[secure computation]].\n\n==The current state of use &ndash; legal and practical==\n{{Globalize|section|date=November 2009}}\nAll digital signature schemes share the following basic prerequisites regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision:\n\n#;Quality algorithms: Some public-key algorithms are known to be insecure, as practical attacks against them having been discovered.\n#\n#; Quality implementations: An implementation of a good algorithm (or [[cryptographic protocol|protocol]]) with mistake(s) will not work.\n#\n#; Users (and their software) must carry out the signature protocol properly.\n#\n#; The private key must remain private: If the private key becomes known to any other party, that party can produce ''perfect'' digital signatures of anything whatsoever.\n#\n#; The public key owner must be verifiable: A public key associated with Bob actually came from Bob. This is commonly done using a [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) and the public key\u2194user association is attested by the operator of the PKI (called a [[certificate authority]]). For 'open' PKIs in which anyone can request such an attestation (universally embodied in a cryptographically protected [[identity certificate]]), the possibility of mistaken attestation is non-trivial. Commercial PKI operators have suffered several publicly known problems. Such mistakes could lead to falsely signed, and thus wrongly attributed, documents. 'Closed' PKI systems are more expensive, but less easily subverted in this way.\n\nOnly if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message, and therefore of their assent to its contents. Legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities, though some such have not reflected this actuality.\n\nLegislatures, being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI, or by the technological avant-garde advocating new solutions to old problems, have enacted statutes and/or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing, endorsing, encouraging, or permitting digital signatures and providing for (or limiting) their legal effect. The first appears to have been in [[Utah]] in the United States, followed closely by the states [[Massachusetts]] and [[California]]. Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time. These enactments (or proposed enactments) vary from place to place, have typically embodied expectations at variance (optimistically or pessimistically) with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering, and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers, nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable. Adoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation, delaying a more or less unified engineering position on [[interoperability]], [[algorithm]] choice, [[key length]]s, and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide.\n\n{{see also|ABA digital signature guidelines}}\n\n==Industry standards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSome industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between members of the industry and with regulators.  These include the [[Automotive Network Exchange]] for the automobile industry and the [[SAFE-BioPharma Association]] for the [[healthcare industry]].\n\n===Using separate key pairs for signing and encryption===\nIn several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature, as in the \n[[Electronic Signatures Directive|1999 EU digital signature directive]] and [[EIDAS|2014 EU follow-on legislation]].<ref name=Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig /> Generally, these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair, a person can engage in an encrypted conversation (e.g., regarding a real estate transaction), but the encryption does not legally sign every message she or he sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the encrypted link.  If a signing key is lost or compromised, it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions.  If an encryption key is lost, a backup or [[key escrow]] should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content.  Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed unless the backup destination is securely encrypted.\n\n==See also==\n* [[21 CFR 11]]\n* [[X.509]]\n* [[Advanced electronic signature]]\n* [[Blind signature]]\n* [[Detached signature]]\n* [[Digital certificate]]\n* [[Digital signature in Estonia]]\n* [[Electronic lab notebook]]\n* [[Electronic signature]]\n* [[Electronic signatures and law]]\n* [[eSign (India)]]\n* [[GNU Privacy Guard]]\n* [[Public key infrastructure]]\n* [[Server-based signatures]]\n* [[Probabilistic signature scheme]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last1=Goldreich|first1=Oded|title=Foundations of cryptography I: Basic Tools|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-54689-1}}\n*{{citation|last1=Goldreich|first1=Oded|title=Foundations of cryptography II: Basic Applications|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still testing only about a hundred samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] and [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] issue the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still testing only about a hundred samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] and [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] issue the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

This was the third volume of ''The Narrative of the Voyages of H.M. Ships Adventure and Beagle'', the other volumes of which were written or edited by the commanders of the ships. ''Journal and Remarks'' covers Darwin's part in the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second survey expedition]] of the ship [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']]. Due to the popularity of Darwin's account, the publisher reissued it later in 1839 as Darwin's '''''Journal of Researches''''', and the revised second edition published in 1845 used this title. A republication of the book in 1905 introduced the title ''The Voyage of the \"Beagle\"'', by which it is now best known.{{sfn|Freeman|1977}}\n\nThe ''Beagle'' sailed from [[Plymouth Sound]] on 27 December 1831 under the command of Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]]. While the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost five\u2014the ''Beagle'' did not return until 2 October 1836. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land (three years and three months on land; 18 months at sea). The book is a vivid travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal covering [[biology]], geology, and [[anthropology]] that demonstrates Darwin's keen powers of observation, written at a time when [[Western world|Western Europeans]] were exploring and charting the whole world. Although Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of the book are ordered by reference to places and locations rather than by date.\n\nDarwin's notes made during the voyage include comments hinting at his changing views on the fixity of [[species]].  On his return, he wrote the book based on these notes, at a time when he was [[Inception of Darwin's theory|first developing his theories]] of [[evolution]] through [[common descent]] and [[natural selection]]. The book includes some suggestions of his ideas, particularly in the second edition of 1845.\n\n==Publication of FitzRoy's narrative and Darwin's book==\nDarwin was invited by FitzRoy to contribute the natural history section to the captain's account of the ''Beagle''{{'}}s voyage. Using his field notes and the journal which he had been sending home for his family to read, he completed this section by September 1837. FitzRoy had to edit the notes of the previous captain of the ''Beagle'', as well as write his own account of the voyage and the previous expeditions of two ships.\n\nThe account was completed and published as a four-volume set in May 1839 as the '''''Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle'''''.<ref name=ReviewNarrative>{{cite journal|title=''Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S.

Darwin's '''''Journal and Remarks, 1832\u20131835''''' forms the third volume, and the fourth volume is a lengthy appendix. FitzRoy's account includes ''Remarks with reference to the Deluge'' in which he recanted his earlier interest in the geological writings of [[Charles Lyell]] and his remarks to Darwin during the expedition that sedimentary features they saw \"could never have been effected by a forty days' flood\", asserting his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible.<ref name=deluge>''[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=776 A very few Remarks with reference to the Deluge.]'', CHAPTER XXVIII of \u2013 {{Citation\n  | last = FitzRoy\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

This edition was commissioned by the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who actually paid Darwin a fee of \u00a3150 for the copyright. The full title was modified to '''''Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the world'''''.{{sfn|Freeman|1977}}\n\nIn the first edition, Darwin remarks in regard to the similarity of [[Gal\u00e1pagos wildlife]] to that on the South American continent, \"The circumstance would be explained, according to the views of some authors, by saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law over a wide area\". (This was written in a reference to [[Charles Lyell]]'s ideas of \"centres of creation\".) Darwin notes the gradations in size of the beaks of species of finches, suspects that species \"are confined to different islands\", \"But there is not space in this work, to enter into this curious subject.\"\n\nLater editions hint at his new ideas on evolution:\n<blockquote>Considering the small size of these islands, we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range... within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact \u2013 that mystery of mysteries \u2013 the first appearance of new beings on this earth.</blockquote>\nSpeaking of the finches with their gradations in size of beaks, he writes \"one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"\n\nIn 1890 [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] published an illustrated edition of the book, at the suggestion of the artist [[Robert Taylor Pritchett]] who was already known for accompanying voyages of the [[HMS Sealark (1903)|RYS ''Wanderer'']] and [[Sunbeam RYS (1874)|''Sunbeam'']], and producing pictures used in books on these cruises.<ref name=\"Elmbridge Hundred Pritchett\">{{cite web |url=http://people.elmbridgehundred.org.uk/biographies/biography.asp?id=246 |title=The Elmbridge Hundred &#124; Robert Taylor Pritchett |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> In his foreword to this edition of ''Journal and Researches'', Murray said that most \"of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin's book by his side\", and the illustrations had been \"chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains\".{{sfn|Darwin|1890|pp=ii, v}}\n\n==Contents \u2013 places Darwin visited==\nFor readability, the chapters of the book are arranged geographically rather than in an exact chronological sequence of places Darwin visited or revisited.<ref name=kxx>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=xx}}</ref> The main headings (and in some cases subheadings) of each chapter give a good idea of where he went, but not the exact sequence.

After chapter X on Tierra del Fuego, chapter XI had the revised heading \"Strait of Magellan\u2013Climate of the Southern Coasts\". The following chapters were renumbered accordingly. Chapter XIV was given the revised heading \"Chiloe and Concepcion: Great Earthquake\", and chapter XX had the heading \"Keeling Island:\u2013Coral Formations\", with the concluding chapter XXI keeping the heading \"Mauritius to England\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation\n | doi     = 10.2307/1793952\n \n | author1     = Darwin, Charles\n | date        = June 1960\n | title       = Darwin as a Traveller\n | journal     = The Geographical Journal\n | issue       = Vol. 126, No. 2.\n | pages       = 129\u2013136\n | volume     = 126\n | jstor     = 1793952 }} Retrieved on 15 December 2006\n*{{Citation\n | surname     = Browne\n | given       = E.

The book is a vivid travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal covering [[biology]], geology, and [[anthropology]] that demonstrates Darwin's keen powers of observation, written at a time when [[Western world|Western Europeans]] were exploring and charting the whole world. Although Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of the book are ordered by reference to places and locations rather than by date.\n\nDarwin's notes made during the voyage include comments hinting at his changing views on the fixity of [[species]].  On his return, he wrote the book based on these notes, at a time when he was [[Inception of Darwin's theory|first developing his theories]] of [[evolution]] through [[common descent]] and [[natural selection]]. The book includes some suggestions of his ideas, particularly in the second edition of 1845.\n\n==Publication of FitzRoy's narrative and Darwin's book==\nDarwin was invited by FitzRoy to contribute the natural history section to the captain's account of the ''Beagle''{{'}}s voyage. Using his field notes and the journal which he had been sending home for his family to read, he completed this section by September 1837. FitzRoy had to edit the notes of the previous captain of the ''Beagle'', as well as write his own account of the voyage and the previous expeditions of two ships.\n\nThe account was completed and published as a four-volume set in May 1839 as the '''''Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle'''''.<ref name=ReviewNarrative>{{cite journal|title=''Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S.

Darwin's '''''Journal and Remarks, 1832\u20131835''''' forms the third volume, and the fourth volume is a lengthy appendix. FitzRoy's account includes ''Remarks with reference to the Deluge'' in which he recanted his earlier interest in the geological writings of [[Charles Lyell]] and his remarks to Darwin during the expedition that sedimentary features they saw \"could never have been effected by a forty days' flood\", asserting his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible.<ref name=deluge>''[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=776 A very few Remarks with reference to the Deluge.]'', CHAPTER XXVIII of \u2013 {{Citation\n  | last = FitzRoy\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

'Beagle,' under the command of Captain Fitz Roy (1913) (14580358598).jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology'']]\n\nThe second edition of 1845 incorporated extensive revisions made in the light of interpretation of the field collections and developing ideas on evolution. This edition was commissioned by the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who actually paid Darwin a fee of \u00a3150 for the copyright. The full title was modified to '''''Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the world'''''.{{sfn|Freeman|1977}}\n\nIn the first edition, Darwin remarks in regard to the similarity of [[Gal\u00e1pagos wildlife]] to that on the South American continent, \"The circumstance would be explained, according to the views of some authors, by saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law over a wide area\". (This was written in a reference to [[Charles Lyell]]'s ideas of \"centres of creation\".) Darwin notes the gradations in size of the beaks of species of finches, suspects that species \"are confined to different islands\", \"But there is not space in this work, to enter into this curious subject.\"\n\nLater editions hint at his new ideas on evolution:\n<blockquote>Considering the small size of these islands, we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range... within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact \u2013 that mystery of mysteries \u2013 the first appearance of new beings on this earth.</blockquote>\nSpeaking of the finches with their gradations in size of beaks, he writes \"one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"\n\nIn 1890 [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] published an illustrated edition of the book, at the suggestion of the artist [[Robert Taylor Pritchett]] who was already known for accompanying voyages of the [[HMS Sealark (1903)|RYS ''Wanderer'']] and [[Sunbeam RYS (1874)|''Sunbeam'']], and producing pictures used in books on these cruises.<ref name=\"Elmbridge Hundred Pritchett\">{{cite web |url=http://people.elmbridgehundred.org.uk/biographies/biography.asp?id=246 |title=The Elmbridge Hundred &#124; Robert Taylor Pritchett |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> In his foreword to this edition of ''Journal and Researches'', Murray said that most \"of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin's book by his side\", and the illustrations had been \"chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains\".{{sfn|Darwin|1890|pp=ii, v}}\n\n==Contents \u2013 places Darwin visited==\nFor readability, the chapters of the book are arranged geographically rather than in an exact chronological sequence of places Darwin visited or revisited.<ref name=kxx>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=xx}}</ref> The main headings (and in some cases subheadings) of each chapter give a good idea of where he went, but not the exact sequence. See [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']] for a detailed synopsis of Darwin's travels. The contents list in the book also notes topics discussed in each chapter, not shown here for simplicity. Names and spellings are those used by Darwin. The list below is based on the ''Journal and Remarks'' of 1839.\n\n*Preface\n# Chapter I: [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St. Jago]]\u2013[[Cape Verde|Cape de Verde Islands]] ([[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks|St. Paul's Rocks]], [[Fernando de Noronha|Fernando Noronha]], 20 Feb.., [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia, or San Salvador, Brazil]], 29 Feb..)\n# Chapter II: [[Rio de Janeiro]]\n# Chapter III: [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]]\n# Chapter IV: [[R\u00edo Negro (Uruguay)|R\u00edo Negro]] to Bahia Blanca\n# Chapter V: [[Bahia Blanca]]\n# Chapter VI: Bahia Blanca to Buenos Ayres\n# Chapter VII: [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]] to [[Santa Fe, Argentina|St. Fe]]\n# Chapter VIII: [[Banda Oriental]]\n# Chapter IX: [[Patagonia]]\n# Chapter X: [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]]\u2013Patagonia\n# Chapter XI: [[Tierra del Fuego]]\n# Chapter XII: The [[Falkland Islands]]\n# Chapter XIII: [[Straits of Magellan|Strait of Magellan]]\n# Chapter XIV: Central [[Chile]]\n# Chapter XV: [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chiloe]] and [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos Islands]]\n# Chapter XVI: Chiloe and [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepcion]]\n# Chapter XVII: Passage of [[American Cordillera|Cordillera]]\n# Chapter XVIII: Northern Chile and [[Peru]]\n# Chapter XIX: [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Archipelago]]\n# Chapter XX: [[Tahiti]] and New Zealand\n# Chapter XXI: Australia ([[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]])\n# Chapter XXII: [[Coral]] Formations ([[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling or Cocos Islands]])\n# Chapter XXIII: [[Mauritius]] to England\n\nIn the second edition, the ''Journal of Researches'' of 1845, chapters VIII and IX were merged into a new chapter VIII on \"Banda Oriental and Patagonia\", and chapter IX now included \"Santa Cruz, Patagonia and The Falkland Islands\". After chapter X on Tierra del Fuego, chapter XI had the revised heading \"Strait of Magellan\u2013Climate of the Southern Coasts\". The following chapters were renumbered accordingly. Chapter XIV was given the revised heading \"Chiloe and Concepcion: Great Earthquake\", and chapter XX had the heading \"Keeling Island:\u2013Coral Formations\", with the concluding chapter XXI keeping the heading \"Mauritius to England\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation\n | doi     = 10.2307/1793952\n \n | author1     = Darwin, Charles\n | date        = June 1960\n | title       = Darwin as a Traveller\n | journal     = The Geographical Journal\n | issue       = Vol. 126, No. 2.\n | pages       = 129\u2013136\n | volume     = 126\n | jstor     = 1793952 }} Retrieved on 15 December 2006\n*{{Citation\n | surname     = Browne\n | given       = E.

As a result, the United States invaded the port city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupying it for more than six months]]. This contributed to the fall of President [[Victoriano Huerta]], who resigned in July 1914.\n\nIn the midst of the Mexican Revolution, ''[[de facto]]'' President Huerta struggled to defend his power and territory from the forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the state of Morelos and the rapid advance of the Northern opposition [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Constitutionalists]] under the leadership of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. By March 26, 1914, Carranza's forces were {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr = on}} from the prosperous coastal oil town of [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]]. There was a considerable settlement of U.S. citizens in the area due to the immense investment by U.S. firms in the local oil industry. Several U.S. Navy warships commanded by [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry T. Mayo]] were deployed off the coast for the stated purpose of protecting American citizens and property.<ref name=\"Quirk\">{{cite book |last1=Quirk |first1=Robert |title=An Affair of Honor: Woodrow Wilson and the Occupation of Veracruz |date=1962 |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |isbn=9780393003901 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/affairofhonorwoo0000quir/page/3 3-14] |url=https://archive.org/details/affairofhonorwoo0000quir/page/3 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. occupation of Veracruz resulted in widespread [[anti-Americanism|anti-American sentiment]] among Mexican residents, and other U.S. warships were used to evacuate U.S. nationals from both the Gulf Coast and the west coast of Mexico, taking them to refugee centers in [[San Diego]], California; [[Texas City, Texas|Texas City]], Texas; and [[New Orleans]]. As a result of anti-American sentiment, Mexico maintained neutrality during World War I, refusing to support the U.S. in Europe, all the while continuing to do business with Germany. With the U.S. threatening to invade in 1918 to take control of the Tampico oil fields, Mexican President [[Venustiano Carranza]] threatened to have them destroyed to prevent their falling under U.S. control.\n\n== Background ==\nBy the spring of 1914, diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico were strained. [[US President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] refused to recognize the presidency of Mexican General [[Victoriano Huerta]], who had been installed as president the previous year after Huerta and the conservative rebel [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]], a nephew of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], had signed the Embassy Pact with the approval of US Ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], who had since been removed by the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Wilsonian-Missionary-Diplomacy-Intervention-in-mexico.html|title=''Wilsonian Missionary Diplomacy- Intervention in Mexico''|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|36-37}}\n\nDuring his [[State of the Union]] address on 2 Dec. 1913, Wilson stated, \"There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority.\"  In Jan, 1914, Wilson recognized the Constitutionalists, and lifted the arms embargo on 3 Feb.  With these moves, Wilson was moving closer to intervention.<ref name=John>{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=John |title=Woodrow Wilson: A Biography |date=2011 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=9780307277909 |page=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n\nMayo's [[Atlantic Fleet (United States)|Fifth Division of the Atlantic Fleet]], was in Tampico to protect American lives and interest.  Ships at his disposal included the battleships ([[USS Connecticut (BB-18)|''Connecticut'']] and [[USS Minnesota (BB-22)|''Minnesota'']]) and the cruisers ([[USS Chester (CL-1)|''Chester'']] and [[USS Des Moines (CL-17)|''Des Moines'']]).  American interests included the Standard Oil refinery at Arbol Grande, other petroleum properties at Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and associated American families and homes nearby.  Although [[Tampico]] was besieged by Constitutionalist forces, relations between the US forces and Huerta's federal garrison remained amicable. Mayo's [[flagship]], the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Dolphin|PG-24|2}}, honored a request of the Mexican government and fired a [[21-gun salute]] to the Mexican flag three times on 2 April.<ref name=\"Logbook of USS Dolphin\">Logbook of USS Dolphin</ref> This was in commemoration of the capture of [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] from the [[French intervention in Mexico|French]] in 1867 by General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].  Additionally, sailors from the American gun boat and 2 cruisers, anchored off Tampico in the [[P\u00e1nuco River]], went ashore each day to play baseball.<ref name=Quirk/>\n\nOn 6 April, Constitutionalist rebel forces, under the command of Col. Emiliano J. Nafarrete, occupied La Barra, Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and Arbol Grande. General Ignacio Morelos Zaragoza, Tamaulipas governor and commander of the federal garrison, sent  his gunboat ''Veracruz'' to shell the rebel forces behind the oil tanks.  Mayo sent a letter to both parties stating he would remain neutral, but to protect American lives and property, he would \"take all necessary steps.\"  Mayo then evacuated several Americans, but refused to land troops to protect the American refinery.  After additional rebel attacks on 7 and 8 April at the Iturbide Bridge, the foreign population sought refuge on the American ships, and the cruisers [[SMS Dresden (1907)|''Dresden'']] and [[HMS Hermione (1893)|''Hermione'']].  Clarence Miller, American [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Tampico, sent an urgent request for help in evacuating the American population within the city.  Then, on the evening of 8 April, a marine [[courier]] for the American consulate was detained but soon released.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|14-18}} \n\nRunning short on gasoline, ''Dolphin's'' Capt.

Ensign Copp was faulted by Mayo for allowing his men to be taken from an American vessel.  Furthermore, Mayo viewed the incident as an insult to American sovereignty, requiring reparation.  Mayo had Commander [[William A.

Huerta stated, \"Is it a calamity? No. It is the best thing that could happen to us.\"  On 15 April, Wilson stated regarding the Mexico situation, there had been \"many cases...of the flouting of the rights of American citizens or the dignity of the government of the United States, and no attempt at either reparation or correction.\"  On 16 April, Washington was notified that Huerta had agreed to a simultaneous salute, signifying \"satisfaction with which the two countries see the happy end of a conflict which has at no time been really serious.\"  Yet Wilson decided the American fleet would stay to prevent any ...\"manifestations of ill-will and contempt for the United States which Huerta has exhibited in the past,\" and misunderstood Huerta's meaning of simultaneous.  When simultaneous was finally understood, Wilson opposed the idea, and fleet orders remained the same.  Huerta maintained he had done \"everything he was obliged to do.\"  On 18 April, Wilson stated he would see Congress, \"with a view of taking such actions as may be necessary to enforce the respect due to the nation's flag,\" if Mexico did not fire the salute by the next day.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|48-51,53,60-62,65}}\n\n[[File:U.S. Navy Destroyers at Mazatlan, Mexico, April 26, 1914.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|USS ''Truxtun'' and ''Whipple'' at Mazatlan, April 26, 1914, keeping watch on Mexican gunboat ''Morales'' (two-funnel ship in background)]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWilson sought Congressional approval for the use of armed forces on 20 April.

No. It is the best thing that could happen to us.\"  On 15 April, Wilson stated regarding the Mexico situation, there had been \"many cases...of the flouting of the rights of American citizens or the dignity of the government of the United States, and no attempt at either reparation or correction.\"  On 16 April, Washington was notified that Huerta had agreed to a simultaneous salute, signifying \"satisfaction with which the two countries see the happy end of a conflict which has at no time been really serious.\"  Yet Wilson decided the American fleet would stay to prevent any ...\"manifestations of ill-will and contempt for the United States which Huerta has exhibited in the past,\" and misunderstood Huerta's meaning of simultaneous.  When simultaneous was finally understood, Wilson opposed the idea, and fleet orders remained the same.  Huerta maintained he had done \"everything he was obliged to do.\"  On 18 April, Wilson stated he would see Congress, \"with a view of taking such actions as may be necessary to enforce the respect due to the nation's flag,\" if Mexico did not fire the salute by the next day.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|48-51,53,60-62,65}}\n\n[[File:U.S. Navy Destroyers at Mazatlan, Mexico, April 26, 1914.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|USS ''Truxtun'' and ''Whipple'' at Mazatlan, April 26, 1914, keeping watch on Mexican gunboat ''Morales'' (two-funnel ship in background)]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWilson sought Congressional approval for the use of armed forces on 20 April.

Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] and agreement at [[WP:FAC]], this article will refer to the club in the singular and the team in plural--> is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England, that competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed 'the Hatters' and affiliated to the [[Bedfordshire County Football Association]]. The team plays its home matches at [[Kenilworth Road]], where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous [[Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations]], and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]; the team won its only major honour, the [[Football League Cup]], in 1988.\n\nThe club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined [[English Football League|the Football League]] before the [[1897\u201398 Football League|1897\u201398 season]], left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]] and contested a major final for the first time when playing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1959 FA Cup Final]]. The team was then relegated from the top division in [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] from the [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366 season]]. However, it was promoted back to the top level by [[1974\u201375 Luton Town F.C. season|1974\u201375]].\n\nLuton Town's most recent successful period began in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]], when the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20132 in the [[1988 Football League Cup Final]] and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the [[1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]]. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the [[2008\u201309 Luton Town F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in [[non-League football]] before winning the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2013\u201314 Luton Town F.C. season|2013\u201314]], securing promotion back into the Football League.\n\n==History==\n{{details|History of Luton Town F.C.

A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in [[High Town, Luton|High Town]]. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town\u2014which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G&nbsp;H Small and seconded by E&nbsp;H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter Six \u2013 11th April 1885 |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/chapter-6-11th-april-1885/ |work=Straw Plaiters: Luton Town Football Club in the Victorian era |publisher=Brian Webb |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially based at Excelsior's [[Dallow Lane]] ground,<ref name=Hayes55/> Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890.

These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374 season]].

The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep [[cochineal]] red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters \"LTFC\" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.<ref name=papbadge>{{cite book |title=The Hatters: Passion and Pride since 1885 |chapter=The Badge |year=2011 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |page=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters \"Lt\", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text.<ref name=papbadge/> In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The \"rainbow\" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath.<ref name=papbadge/> This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design. The club's founding year, 1885, was added in 2008.<ref name=HFK/> The badge was altered once more during the [[2009\u201310 Luton Town F.C. season|2009\u201310]] pre-season, with the red of the town crest being replaced with orange to better reflect the club colours.<ref name=kit2011>{{cite web |title=Revealed: The New Crest |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1735608,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301145328/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1735608%2C00.html |archivedate=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first sponsor to appear on a Luton Town shirt was Tricentrol, a local motor company based in [[Dunstable]], who sponsored the club from March 1980 to 1982; the deal was worth \u00a350,000.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Luton sign \u00a350,000 deal |journal=Luton Town |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=1 March 1980}}</ref> Subsequent sponsors have been [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford Trucks]] (1982 to 1990), [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] (1990 to 1991), Universal Salvage Auctions (1991 to 1999), [[SKF]] (1999 to 2003), Travel Extras (2003 to 2005), [[Electrolux]] (2005 to 2008), [[Carbrini Sportswear]] (2008 to 2009),<ref name=HFK/> [[EasyJet]] and [[National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting|NICEIC]] (concurrently, 2009 to 2015),<ref name=kit2011/><ref>{{cite web |title=Revealed: The New Sponsors |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1735654,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055507/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1735654%2C00.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Get the new look! |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/kit-launch-190713-931659.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=EasyJet sponsorship + new kit for next season |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/luton-town-easyjet-sponsorship-new-kit-1676449.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hatters continue NICEIC partnership |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/town-continue-niceic-partnership-1880610.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Barnfield College]] and NICEIC (concurrently, 2015 to 2016).<ref>{{cite web |title=Barnfield College named as new Luton shirt sponsor |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/barnfield-college-named-new-luton-town-shirt-sponsor-2584018.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Back of shirt and short sponsors meet the team! |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/back-of-shirt-and-short-sponsors-meet-the-team-2677793.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=9 September 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> Since June 2016, the club's kit has been sponsored by NICEIC and [[SsangYong Motor|SsangYong Motor UK]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New sponsors are SsangYong Motor UK Ltd |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/luton-town-ssangyong-motor-uk-ltd-puma-3153548.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe club released the song \"Hatters, Hatters\", a collaboration between the Luton team and the Bedfordshire-based musical comedy group [[the Barron Knights]], in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Miranda Hart after Eric Impersonators |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/miranda-hart-coming-to-kenilworth-road-531301.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Eight years later another song featuring vocals by the Luton players, \"We're Luton Town\", was released to celebrate the club's promotion to the First Division.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=We're Luton Town |type=vinyl record |others=Luton Town Football Club |publisher=Artesian Records |year=1982 |id=ARC 314 A}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main article|Dallow Lane|Dunstable Road|Kenilworth Road}}\n\n[[File:Kenilworth Road.jpg|thumb|The view from the Kenilworth End in 2007.

Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] and agreement at [[WP:FAC]], this article will refer to the club in the singular and the team in plural--> is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England, that competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed 'the Hatters' and affiliated to the [[Bedfordshire County Football Association]]. The team plays its home matches at [[Kenilworth Road]], where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous [[Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations]], and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]; the team won its only major honour, the [[Football League Cup]], in 1988.\n\nThe club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined [[English Football League|the Football League]] before the [[1897\u201398 Football League|1897\u201398 season]], left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]] and contested a major final for the first time when playing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1959 FA Cup Final]]. The team was then relegated from the top division in [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] from the [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366 season]]. However, it was promoted back to the top level by [[1974\u201375 Luton Town F.C. season|1974\u201375]].\n\nLuton Town's most recent successful period began in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]], when the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20132 in the [[1988 Football League Cup Final]] and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the [[1991\u201392 Luton Town F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]]. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons.

A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in [[High Town, Luton|High Town]]. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town\u2014which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G&nbsp;H Small and seconded by E&nbsp;H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter Six \u2013 11th April 1885 |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/chapter-6-11th-april-1885/ |work=Straw Plaiters: Luton Town Football Club in the Victorian era |publisher=Brian Webb |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially based at Excelsior's [[Dallow Lane]] ground,<ref name=Hayes55/> Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890.

These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374 season]]. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984.

The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep [[cochineal]] red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters \"LTFC\" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.<ref name=papbadge>{{cite book |title=The Hatters: Passion and Pride since 1885 |chapter=The Badge |year=2011 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |page=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters \"Lt\", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text.<ref name=papbadge/> In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The \"rainbow\" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath.<ref name=papbadge/> This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design. The club's founding year, 1885, was added in 2008.<ref name=HFK/> The badge was altered once more during the [[2009\u201310 Luton Town F.C. season|2009\u201310]] pre-season, with the red of the town crest being replaced with orange to better reflect the club colours.<ref name=kit2011>{{cite web |title=Revealed: The New Crest |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1735608,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301145328/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1735608%2C00.html |archivedate=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first sponsor to appear on a Luton Town shirt was Tricentrol, a local motor company based in [[Dunstable]], who sponsored the club from March 1980 to 1982; the deal was worth \u00a350,000.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Luton sign \u00a350,000 deal |journal=Luton Town |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=1 March 1980}}</ref> Subsequent sponsors have been [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford Trucks]] (1982 to 1990), [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] (1990 to 1991), Universal Salvage Auctions (1991 to 1999), [[SKF]] (1999 to 2003), Travel Extras (2003 to 2005), [[Electrolux]] (2005 to 2008), [[Carbrini Sportswear]] (2008 to 2009),<ref name=HFK/> [[EasyJet]] and [[National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting|NICEIC]] (concurrently, 2009 to 2015),<ref name=kit2011/><ref>{{cite web |title=Revealed: The New Sponsors |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1735654,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055507/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1735654%2C00.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Get the new look! |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/kit-launch-190713-931659.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=EasyJet sponsorship + new kit for next season |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/luton-town-easyjet-sponsorship-new-kit-1676449.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hatters continue NICEIC partnership |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/town-continue-niceic-partnership-1880610.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Barnfield College]] and NICEIC (concurrently, 2015 to 2016).<ref>{{cite web |title=Barnfield College named as new Luton shirt sponsor |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/barnfield-college-named-new-luton-town-shirt-sponsor-2584018.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Back of shirt and short sponsors meet the team! |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/back-of-shirt-and-short-sponsors-meet-the-team-2677793.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=9 September 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> Since June 2016, the club's kit has been sponsored by NICEIC and [[SsangYong Motor|SsangYong Motor UK]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New sponsors are SsangYong Motor UK Ltd |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/luton-town-ssangyong-motor-uk-ltd-puma-3153548.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe club released the song \"Hatters, Hatters\", a collaboration between the Luton team and the Bedfordshire-based musical comedy group [[the Barron Knights]], in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Miranda Hart after Eric Impersonators |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/miranda-hart-coming-to-kenilworth-road-531301.aspx |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Eight years later another song featuring vocals by the Luton players, \"We're Luton Town\", was released to celebrate the club's promotion to the First Division.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=We're Luton Town |type=vinyl record |others=Luton Town Football Club |publisher=Artesian Records |year=1982 |id=ARC 314 A}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main article|Dallow Lane|Dunstable Road|Kenilworth Road}}\n\n[[File:Kenilworth Road.jpg|thumb|The view from the Kenilworth End in 2007.

Deep Blue won the deciding [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|game six]] after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\n\nThe system derived its playing strength mainly from [[brute-force search|brute force]] computing power. It was a [[massively parallel]], [[IBM Scalable POWERparallel|RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC]]-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120&nbsp;MHz [[POWER2|P2SC]] [[microprocessor]], enhanced with 480 special purpose [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and ran under the [[AIX operating system|AIX]] [[operating system]]. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful [[supercomputer]] according to the [[TOP500]] list, achieving 11.38 [[GFLOPS]] on the High-Performance [[LINPACK]] benchmark.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 TOP500 Super Computer List \u2013 June 1997 (201\u2013300)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213103245/http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 |date=13 February 2009 }} Top500.org</ref>\n\nThe Deep Blue chess computer that defeated [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations.<ref>Campbell 1998, p. 88.</ref> [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]] and [[Monty Newborn]] estimate that one additional [[Ply (game theory)|ply]] (half-move) increases the playing strength between 50 and 70 [[Elo rating system|Elo]] points.<ref>Levy & Newborn 1991, p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:Kasparov Magath 1985 Hamburg-2.png|thumb|Kasparov in 1985]]\n\nDeep Blue's [[evaluation function]] was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g. how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). The optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself, by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function had been split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. In the opening book there were over 4,000 positions and 700,000 [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] games. The endgame database contained many six-piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions. Before the second match, the chess knowledge of the program was fine-tuned by grandmaster [[Joel Benjamin]]. The opening library was provided by grandmasters [[Miguel Illescas]], [[John Fedorowicz]], and [[Nick de Firmian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/what-deep-blue-learned-in-chess-school.html|title=What Deep Blue Learned in Chess School|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=1997-05-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused.

The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play that were revealed during the course of the match.

Deep Blue won the deciding [[Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|game six]] after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\n\nThe system derived its playing strength mainly from [[brute-force search|brute force]] computing power. It was a [[massively parallel]], [[IBM Scalable POWERparallel|RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC]]-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120&nbsp;MHz [[POWER2|P2SC]] [[microprocessor]], enhanced with 480 special purpose [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and ran under the [[AIX operating system|AIX]] [[operating system]]. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful [[supercomputer]] according to the [[TOP500]] list, achieving 11.38 [[GFLOPS]] on the High-Performance [[LINPACK]] benchmark.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 TOP500 Super Computer List \u2013 June 1997 (201\u2013300)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213103245/http://www.top500.org/list/1997/06/300 |date=13 February 2009 }} Top500.org</ref>\n\nThe Deep Blue chess computer that defeated [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations.<ref>Campbell 1998, p. 88.</ref> [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]] and [[Monty Newborn]] estimate that one additional [[Ply (game theory)|ply]] (half-move) increases the playing strength between 50 and 70 [[Elo rating system|Elo]] points.<ref>Levy & Newborn 1991, p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:Kasparov Magath 1985 Hamburg-2.png|thumb|Kasparov in 1985]]\n\nDeep Blue's [[evaluation function]] was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g. how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). The optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself, by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function had been split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. In the opening book there were over 4,000 positions and 700,000 [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] games. The endgame database contained many six-piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions. Before the second match, the chess knowledge of the program was fine-tuned by grandmaster [[Joel Benjamin]]. The opening library was provided by grandmasters [[Miguel Illescas]], [[John Fedorowicz]], and [[Nick de Firmian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/what-deep-blue-learned-in-chess-school.html|title=What Deep Blue Learned in Chess School|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=1997-05-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused.
