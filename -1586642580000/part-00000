A group of individuals at one location is referred to as an aggregation, whether consisting of one sex or both sexes. Male-produced sex attractants have been called aggregation pheromones, because they usually result in the arrival of both sexes at a calling site and increase the density of conspecifics surrounding the pheromone source. Most sex pheromones are produced by the females; only a small percentage of sex attractants are produced by males.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/miller20/carmona.htm|title=Insect aggregation pheromones|website=www.msu.edu|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> Aggregation pheromones have been found in members of the [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Dictyoptera]], and [[Orthoptera]].

Aggregation pheromones are among the most ecologically selective pest suppression methods.

[[Jean Henri Fabre|Fabre]] observed and noted how \"females who lay their eggs in these fruits deposit these mysterious substances in the vicinity of their clutch to signal to other females of the same species they should clutch elsewhere.\" It may be helpful to note that the word epideictic, having to do with display or show (from the Greek 'deixis'), has a different but related meaning in rhetoric, the human art of persuasion by means of words.\n\n===Releaser===\nReleaser pheromones are pheromones that cause an alteration in the behavior of the recipient. For example, some organisms use powerful attractant molecules to attract mates from a distance of two miles or more. In general, this type of pheromone elicits a rapid response, but is quickly degraded. In contrast, a primer pheromone has a slower onset and a longer duration. For example, rabbit (mothers) release mammary pheromones that trigger immediate nursing behavior by their babies.<ref name=\"users.rcn.com\">[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Pheromones.html Kimball, J.W. Pheromones. ''Kimball's Biology Pages''. Sep 2008]</ref>\n\n===Signal===\nSignal pheromones cause short-term changes, such as the neurotransmitter release that activates a response. For instance, GnRH molecule functions as a neurotransmitter in rats to elicit [[lordosis behavior]].<ref name=Kohl01/>\n\n===Primer===\nPrimer pheromones trigger a change of developmental events (in which they differ from all the other pheromones, which trigger a change in behavior).\n\n===Territorial===\nLaid down in the environment, territorial pheromones mark the boundaries and identity of an organism's territory. In cats and dogs, these hormones are present in the urine, which they [[spraying (animal behavior)|deposit on landmarks]] serving to mark the perimeter of the claimed territory. In social seabirds, the preen gland is used to mark nests, nuptial gifts, and territory boundaries with behavior formerly described as '[[displacement activity]]'.<ref name=\"users.rcn.com\"/>\n\n===Trail===\nSocial insects commonly use trail pheromones. For example, [[ant]]s mark their paths with pheromones consisting of volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Certain ants lay down an initial trail of pheromones as they return to the nest with food. This trail attracts other ants and serves as a guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Feb98/antpheromone.hrs.html | title= Excited ants follow pheromone trail of same chemical they will use to paralyze their prey | accessdate= 2006-03-14}}</ref> As long as the food source remains available, visiting ants will continuously renew the pheromone trail. The pheromone requires continuous renewal because it evaporates quickly. When the food supply begins to dwindle, the trail-making ceases. Pharaoh ants (Monomorium pharaonis) mark trails that no longer lead to food with a repellent pheromone, which causes avoidance behaviour in ants.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Robinson|first= E. J.

A group of individuals at one location is referred to as an aggregation, whether consisting of one sex or both sexes. Male-produced sex attractants have been called aggregation pheromones, because they usually result in the arrival of both sexes at a calling site and increase the density of conspecifics surrounding the pheromone source. Most sex pheromones are produced by the females; only a small percentage of sex attractants are produced by males.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/miller20/carmona.htm|title=Insect aggregation pheromones|website=www.msu.edu|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> Aggregation pheromones have been found in members of the [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Dictyoptera]], and [[Orthoptera]].

[[Jean Henri Fabre|Fabre]] observed and noted how \"females who lay their eggs in these fruits deposit these mysterious substances in the vicinity of their clutch to signal to other females of the same species they should clutch elsewhere.\" It may be helpful to note that the word epideictic, having to do with display or show (from the Greek 'deixis'), has a different but related meaning in rhetoric, the human art of persuasion by means of words.\n\n===Releaser===\nReleaser pheromones are pheromones that cause an alteration in the behavior of the recipient. For example, some organisms use powerful attractant molecules to attract mates from a distance of two miles or more. In general, this type of pheromone elicits a rapid response, but is quickly degraded. In contrast, a primer pheromone has a slower onset and a longer duration. For example, rabbit (mothers) release mammary pheromones that trigger immediate nursing behavior by their babies.<ref name=\"users.rcn.com\">[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Pheromones.html Kimball, J.W. Pheromones. ''Kimball's Biology Pages''. Sep 2008]</ref>\n\n===Signal===\nSignal pheromones cause short-term changes, such as the neurotransmitter release that activates a response. For instance, GnRH molecule functions as a neurotransmitter in rats to elicit [[lordosis behavior]].<ref name=Kohl01/>\n\n===Primer===\nPrimer pheromones trigger a change of developmental events (in which they differ from all the other pheromones, which trigger a change in behavior).\n\n===Territorial===\nLaid down in the environment, territorial pheromones mark the boundaries and identity of an organism's territory. In cats and dogs, these hormones are present in the urine, which they [[spraying (animal behavior)|deposit on landmarks]] serving to mark the perimeter of the claimed territory. In social seabirds, the preen gland is used to mark nests, nuptial gifts, and territory boundaries with behavior formerly described as '[[displacement activity]]'.<ref name=\"users.rcn.com\"/>\n\n===Trail===\nSocial insects commonly use trail pheromones. For example, [[ant]]s mark their paths with pheromones consisting of volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Certain ants lay down an initial trail of pheromones as they return to the nest with food. This trail attracts other ants and serves as a guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Feb98/antpheromone.hrs.html | title= Excited ants follow pheromone trail of same chemical they will use to paralyze their prey | accessdate= 2006-03-14}}</ref> As long as the food source remains available, visiting ants will continuously renew the pheromone trail. The pheromone requires continuous renewal because it evaporates quickly. When the food supply begins to dwindle, the trail-making ceases. Pharaoh ants (Monomorium pharaonis) mark trails that no longer lead to food with a repellent pheromone, which causes avoidance behaviour in ants.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Robinson|first= E. J.

The genus has been used as a [[wastebasket taxon]] for thalattosuchian fossils for over two centuries, and almost all known historical species of teleosauroid have been included within it at one point. The genus has remained a wastebasket, with numerous species still included under the label ''\u2018Steneosaurus\u2019'', many of which are unrelated to each other (either [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]] with respect to each other and other genera of teleosauroids).\n\nThe [[type species]], '''''S. rostromajor''''', was only formally recognised as such in 2020, and this revision determined the [[type specimen]] of ''Steneosaurus'' was undiagnostic, and so declared the genus ''Steneosaurus'' a ''nomen dubium''. The remaining species referred to ''Steneosaurus'' thus require new generic names, and some species have already been assigned to new genera prior to ''Steneosaurus'' being declared a ''nomen dubium''.<ref name=\"revised\">{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=M.
