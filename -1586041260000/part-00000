History of Mexico.  Mexico: Castillo. </ref>\n\nIn 1517 [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]] established a system of concessions by which his subjects in America could use slaves, thus starting the slave trade.  When the Spanish settled in New Spain, they brought some workers with them as slaves.  For their part, the Dominican friars who arrived in America denounced the slave condition in which the natives lived.  Moreover, like bishops of other orders, they opposed the unjust and illegal treatment before the audience of the Spanish king and in the Royal Commission afterwards.<ref>[http://www.primariatic.sep.gob.mx/descargas/colecciones/proyectos/SEPIENSA_conectate_y_aprende/contenidos/h_mexicanas/colonia/poblacion_africana/africanos_2.html/ \"The African population in New Spain\" - ''Encyclopedia of the SEP Mexico'' }}</ref>  \n\nA [[Bull]] promulgated by [[Pope]] [[Urban VIII]] on 22 April [[1639]] prohibited slavery in the colonies of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] in [[America]].  The measure was approved by the [[King of Spain]] [[Philip IV of Spain]] on the indigenous people, but allowed the enslavement of African slaves. Many of these slaves, known as ''Cimarrones'', obtained their freedom by escaping and taking refuge in the mountains of [[Orizaba]], [[Xalapa]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba (Mexico)|Cordoba]] in the state of [[Veracruz]].\n== African slavery ==\n \nIn addition to the Indians and the Spaniards, Africans constitute the third root of the mestizo society in Mexico, which has its origin in New Spain.  The international commercial exchanges of that period were not only reduced to products, but also included the humans themselves.  Africa became the continent that supplied slaves to the world.  Thus, the African population arrived in New Spain as slaves to be employed in the heaviest jobs. Given the reduction of the indigenous population caused by demographic disasters, the extraction of people from [[Africa]] as slaves also contributed to one of the disasters registered in modern history if we consider that of the millions of people who left Africa as slaves, many of them would die on the way because of the inhuman conditions in which they were transferred and those who managed to survive were forced to do heavy work in agriculture and livestock farming under the same conditions.\n\nSlaves from Africa were seen as a way to meet the demand for labour.  In [[1521]] the Africans in [[New Spain]] were no more than a dozen and by [[1570]] there were about 20,000; in 1646 they numbered more than 35,000, although the population declined and by [[1810]] they were about 10,000, distributed mainly along the coasts and in tropical areas.  They were destined for crops such as sugar cane.  Slavery continued to be a phenomenon whose activities yielded large profits. \n\nThis practice affected both men (for activities that required a lot of physical strength) and women (for domestic service activities, where they played the roles of wet nurses, washerwomen, cooks, or were responsible for the personal care of their masters).  \"African women and descendants in Mexico City in the 17th century\" pp. 215-216, in Rina C\u00e1ceres (compiler).  Rutas de la esclavitud en Am\u00e9rica Latina\", Costa Rica, Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica, 2001\n\nThe [[Holy Office]] clearly enjoyed a reputation among slaves as a possible way out of the harsh conditions in which they lived.  In the absence of effective civil courts where a complaint of mistreatment could be filed, Afro-Mexicans saw the Inquisition as a way to alleviate this miserable situation.<nowiki><ref></nowiki>''Slaves of the White God'', 90-2; and Davidson, ''Negro Slave'', 240- 41 </ref>\n\nThere were two main methods of offering judicial protection to slaves in [[New Spain]]: \n \n* The first was preventive, consisting of unannounced and sporadic visits to a worksite to record abuses against the labor force, of which slaves formed a significant part.\n \n* The second method was punitive in nature, and occurred when witnesses or the slaves themselves denounced their owner for mistreatment before the Holy Office or audience.  However, cases of protection were very rare throughout the colonial period.<ref> ''Slaves of the White God'', 90-2; and Davidson, ''Negro Slave'', 243</ref>\n\n== Indigenous slavery == \nThe conquest gave rise to the first cases of slavery in [[New Spain]], due to the law of the Spanish.  Before the army of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] went into [[Colhuacan]], the soldiers asked the crown from [[Veracruz]] to allow them to send slaves from Spain for the service and sustenance of their troops.  They foresaw that since this was the land that they were going to conquer for a long time and with many people, some caciques would not want to come to the knowledge of the Catholic faith nor to the king's servitude and would wage war, in which case they asked that, subjugated by force, they could give and distribute slaves ''\"as is customary in the land of infidels, for it is a very just thing\"'.<ref>[[Silvio Zavala|Zavala, S.]]  (1981).  Indian slaves in New Spain.  The National College.  Mexico. p. 11.</ref>\n \nSpanish settlers acquired indigenous slaves in [[New Spain]], just as they did in the [[West Indies]].  They acquired them mainly in two ways: the captivity of those who had been defeated in war, and the rescue of those reduced to servitude by the Indians themselves.  In the first case, slavery was imposed on people who might have been free before the arrival of the Spaniards.  In the second case, the ancient servitude was prolonged, replacing its features with those of European law.  Slaves could be traded under the Spanish regime and to safeguard the master's property, they were shod in the face or body.  Legally and in practice, their condition was more disadvantageous than that of the free Indians.\n\nOn [[14 May]] of [[1524]], the [[royal iron]] arrived in New Spain, sent by the King of Spain to mark (on the leg, buttock, arm or face) the Indian slaves, known as \"[[ransom iron]]\".\nSubsequently, the position prohibiting the enslavement of indigenous people by purchase or inheritance was successfully enforced, although it was permitted only in the case of war captives.  This category included, above all, the indigenous peoples of the north of the country who resisted Spanish rule; this was reflected in the so-called [[New Laws]] of [[1542]] which punished this practice.  The Indians were considered to be physically weaker than the Africans, and so attempts were made to protect them.These laws strictly forbade the practice of slavery in the future and mandated a review of existing cases of servitude.  Slavery of Indians for war and ransom was prohibited.  However, freedom was granted to those in servitude, and the possibility arose that Spanish law would agree by exception to the captivity of Indians who remained in a hostile attitude.<ref>Zavala, Silvio  Indian Slaves in New Spain.  Edition of the National College.  Mexico, 1981. p. 181.</ref>\n\n\nDespite the laws, the exploitation did not disappear, and this, together with the infectious diseases, ended up considerably reducing the population, which was immunologically fragile to the microorganisms carried by both Europeans and Africans.  The decline of the indigenous population was serious and to avoid stopping production on [[Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almansa| Virrey Enr\u00edquez]] in 1580, he advised the purchase of black slaves on behalf of the king, to distribute them at cost to miners, owners of sugar cane fields and mills and other Spanish businessmen.  From then on, the legal introduction of African slaves increased; five thousand a year were authorized for New Spain.<ref>''Historia General de M\u00e9xico'', Mexico, El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, 2000, p. 319.</ref>\n\n== Abolition ==\n\nPeople who found themselves as \"slaves\" could buy their freedom by obtaining a loan or by being released from their masters before they died.  There were also cases of slaves escaping from their masters, and to avoid being recaptured they sought refuge in areas that were difficult for their persecutors to reach, such as jungles and mountains.  As the number of escaped slaves increased, small populations emerged that would be known as [[Quilombo|Palenques]].  Freed slaves who feared being subjugated again began to arrive at such sites.\n\nThe abolition of slavery was part of the ideology of the insurgents during the war of [[Mexican independence]], so that on the instructions of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] this provision was published by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Anzorena]] on October 19, 1810 in Morelia,  by [[Ignacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n]] in [[Tlalpujahua]] on October 24, 1810, by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] through the [[Bando del Aguacatillo]] on November 17, 1810,<ref>Torre Villar, 2000;  406</ref> and by Miguel Hidalgo himself through a side published in [[Guadalajara]] on 29 November 1810,<ref>{{cita web|url=http: //www. library. tv/artman2/publish/1810_115/Bando_del_se_or_Hidalgo_abolishing_slavery_derogues_the_laws_relative_to_tributes_imposes_to_seal_and_extinguish_the_effects_of_national_and_foreign_proh_be_the_use_of_sealed_and_extinguishing_p_tabaco_p_lvora_colores_and_others. shtml|title=Mr. Hidalgo's side abolishing slavery; repealing the laws regarding taxes; imposing alcabala for national and foreign effects; prohibiting the use of sealed paper, and extinguishing the tobacco, gunpowder, colors and other tobacco shops.|accessed=October 5, 2015|apellido=|nombre=|fecha=|obra=500 a\u00f1os de M\u00e9xico en documentos|idioma=|cita=}}</ref> who also published and ordered to print the [[Decreto contra la esclavitud, las gabelas y el papel sellado]] on December 6, 1810 in the same square.<ref> Villoro, Luis (2006).  \"The revolution of independence\".

It was operational from October 1936 until 31 May 1959 when the British were finally withdrawn following the [[14 July Revolution|July 1958 Revolution]]. It was the scene of fierce fighting in May 1941 when it was besieged by the Iraqi Military following the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nIt is currently a major Iraqi military [[airbase]].\n\n==History==\nOriginally called '''RAF Dhibban''', the station was constructed on the west bank of the Euphrates and opened on 19 October 1936. It was the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) base built \"West of the Euphrates\" in accordance with Article 5 of the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]]. It was situated on the West bank of the [[Euphrates]] between [[Ramadi]] and [[Fallujah]], and was a major military and air base for the entire [[British Empire]]. The squadrons, units and headquarters and the hospital gradually moved in from [[RAF Hinaidi]], Baghdad, which was then vacated by the British and renamed \"Rashid Airfield\" by the Iraqis. It was renamed RAF Habbaniya on 1 May 1938.\n\nRAF Habbaniya was extensive and, as well as the airfield, included the Air Headquarters of [[RAF Iraq Command]], communication facilities, maintenance units, an aircraft depot, an RAF hospital, RAF [[Iraq Levies]] barracks, the [[RAF Armoured Car Company]] depot as well as fuel and bomb stores.\n\nThere were numerous billets, messes and a wide range of leisure facilities including swimming pools, cinemas and theatres, sports pitches, tennis courts and riding stables. It was self-contained with its own power station, water purification plant and sewage farm. Water taken from the Euphrates for the irrigation systems enabled green lawns, flower beds and even ornamental Botanical Gardens. After World War II the families of British personnel started living at Habbaniya and a school was started.\n\nWithin the camp perimeter was the Civil Cantonment which provided the accommodation for the families of the RAF [[Iraq Levies]] and the civilian workers and their families. The cantonment population of about 10,000 had their own schools, hospital, mosques, churches, temples, cinema and bazaars. Just outside the perimeter was the village of Humphreya in which more locally employed civilians and their families lived. It was the original construction camp for the company which constructed the base, Messrs Humphreys of [[Knightsbridge]], London (and from which the name Humphreya arose).\n\nThere was a 7-mile perimeter fence round the base but this did not enclose the airfield which was outside. In 1952 a second airfield was built on the plateau to cope with the long range and jet aircraft using the base (this subsequently became the Iraqi Air Force [[Al Taqaddum]] airbase).\n[[File:Lake Habbaniya Sailing Club.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake Habbaniya Sailing Club]]\nIn the late 1930s [[Imperial Airways]] established a staging post on [[Lake Habbaniya]] for the  flying boat service from the [[UK]] to [[British India]] using [[Short Empire]]s.  The lake provided the necessary landing area for these aircraft in the middle of the [[Mesopotamian]] desert.\n\nThe station was a large flying training school during the [[Second World War]], as well as a transport staging airfield. During the [[Rashid Ali al-Kaylani|Rashid Ali]] [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|rebellion in 1941]], the airfield was besieged by units from the [[Iraqi Army|Royal Iraqi Army]] encamped on the overlooking plateau. On 2 May 1941, British forces from the airfield launched pre-emptive [[airstrikes]] on Iraqi forces throughout Iraq and the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] began. The siege was lifted by the units based at Habbaniya, including pilots from the training school, a battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment]] flown in at the last moment, [[Number 1 Armoured Car Company RAF]] and the RAF's Iraq Levies. The subsequent arrival of a relief column (''[[Kingcol]]''), part of ''[[Habforce]]'' sent from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a British mandate, combined with the Habbaniya units to force the rebel forces to retreat to Baghdad.\n\nLater in the [[Second World War]], Habbaniya became an important stage on the southern air route between the UK and the [[USSR]]. [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) ran a regular passenger service via [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] using [[Consolidated Liberator]] transports. The [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] used Habbaniya as a stopover point between the large [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft assembly facility at [[Abadan-Ayatollah Jami International Airport|Abadan Airport]], [[Iran]], and [[Payne Field]], [[Cairo]]. Also ATC operated a transport route from Habbaniya to [[Mehrabad Airport]], [[Tehran]].  After the Second World War, [[BOAC]] discontinued the flying boat service and the hotel buildings at the lake were acquired by the RAF and used as a Rest and Recreation Centre.\n\nOperational RAF squadrons were based at Habbaniya and very many aircraft passed through in transit.\n\n[[Roald Dahl]] was stationed there in 1940, as described in his book, ''[[Going Solo]]'', but his description is somewhat inaccurate and his opinion rather unfavourable compared with that of most personnel who served there.\n\n[[No. 6 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 8 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]] were the last flying squadrons to depart the base in the mid 1950s.<ref>Jefford (2001)</ref>\n\nThe base closed on 31 May 1959 when the British were finally withdrawn following the [[14 July Revolution|July 1958 Revolution]].\n\nIn June 1961 there were two [[Iraqi Air Force]] squadrons at the base:<ref>Tom Cooper [http://www.acig.info/artman/publish/article_203.shtml Kuwait Emergency], Air Combat Information Group</ref>\n* No.1 Squadron, Venom FB.Mk.1, based at Habbaniyah AB, CO Capt.

From this outpost, combat operations are run from the outskirts of [[Fallujah]] to the outskirts of [[Ramadi]].  Since 2006 Camp Habbaniyah has grown into a Regional Training and Regional Support Center as well as the headquarters for the [[Iraqi Army]] [[1st Division (Iraq)|1st Division]].  On going Coalition and Iraqi construction projects have revitalised much of the base.\n\nIn December 2008, the [[U.S. Army]] and all civilian contractors, less twelve contractors from MPRI, departed Camp Habbaniyah. U.S. Marines had stayed behind to provide the Iraqi Army with additional perimeter security until a time TBD.\n\nOn 16 April 2009, a suicide-bomber dressed as an Iraqi 1st Lieutenant detonated a bomb among a group of Iraqi soldiers at a canteen.\n\nAs of 2015, Habbaniya serves as a base for [[Popular Mobilization Forces (Iraq)|Shia militias]], the Iraqi army and its American trainers, in their ongoing campaign against [[ISIS]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The successful campaign provides a blueprint for future battles\u2014with Fallujah and Mosul the next to come|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21684689-successful-campaign-provides-blueprint-future-battleswith-fallujah-and|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n289 British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] personnel, along with women, children and babies, still lie buried in the RAF/[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) cemetery in Habbaniya.

It was self-contained with its own power station, water purification plant and sewage farm. Water taken from the Euphrates for the irrigation systems enabled green lawns, flower beds and even ornamental Botanical Gardens. After World War II the families of British personnel started living at Habbaniya and a school was started.\n\nWithin the camp perimeter was the Civil Cantonment which provided the accommodation for the families of the RAF [[Iraq Levies]] and the civilian workers and their families. The cantonment population of about 10,000 had their own schools, hospital, mosques, churches, temples, cinema and bazaars. Just outside the perimeter was the village of Humphreya in which more locally employed civilians and their families lived. It was the original construction camp for the company which constructed the base, Messrs Humphreys of [[Knightsbridge]], London (and from which the name Humphreya arose).\n\nThere was a 7-mile perimeter fence round the base but this did not enclose the airfield which was outside. In 1952 a second airfield was built on the plateau to cope with the long range and jet aircraft using the base (this subsequently became the Iraqi Air Force [[Al Taqaddum]] airbase).\n[[File:Lake Habbaniya Sailing Club.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake Habbaniya Sailing Club]]\nIn the late 1930s [[Imperial Airways]] established a staging post on [[Lake Habbaniya]] for the  flying boat service from the [[UK]] to [[British India]] using [[Short Empire]]s.  The lake provided the necessary landing area for these aircraft in the middle of the [[Mesopotamian]] desert.\n\nThe station was a large flying training school during the [[Second World War]], as well as a transport staging airfield. During the [[Rashid Ali al-Kaylani|Rashid Ali]] [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|rebellion in 1941]], the airfield was besieged by units from the [[Iraqi Army|Royal Iraqi Army]] encamped on the overlooking plateau. On 2 May 1941, British forces from the airfield launched pre-emptive [[airstrikes]] on Iraqi forces throughout Iraq and the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] began. The siege was lifted by the units based at Habbaniya, including pilots from the training school, a battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment]] flown in at the last moment, [[Number 1 Armoured Car Company RAF]] and the RAF's Iraq Levies. The subsequent arrival of a relief column (''[[Kingcol]]''), part of ''[[Habforce]]'' sent from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a British mandate, combined with the Habbaniya units to force the rebel forces to retreat to Baghdad.\n\nLater in the [[Second World War]], Habbaniya became an important stage on the southern air route between the UK and the [[USSR]]. [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) ran a regular passenger service via [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] using [[Consolidated Liberator]] transports. The [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] used Habbaniya as a stopover point between the large [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft assembly facility at [[Abadan-Ayatollah Jami International Airport|Abadan Airport]], [[Iran]], and [[Payne Field]], [[Cairo]]. Also ATC operated a transport route from Habbaniya to [[Mehrabad Airport]], [[Tehran]].  After the Second World War, [[BOAC]] discontinued the flying boat service and the hotel buildings at the lake were acquired by the RAF and used as a Rest and Recreation Centre.\n\nOperational RAF squadrons were based at Habbaniya and very many aircraft passed through in transit.\n\n[[Roald Dahl]] was stationed there in 1940, as described in his book, ''[[Going Solo]]'', but his description is somewhat inaccurate and his opinion rather unfavourable compared with that of most personnel who served there.\n\n[[No. 6 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 8 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]] were the last flying squadrons to depart the base in the mid 1950s.<ref>Jefford (2001)</ref>\n\nThe base closed on 31 May 1959 when the British were finally withdrawn following the [[14 July Revolution|July 1958 Revolution]].\n\nIn June 1961 there were two [[Iraqi Air Force]] squadrons at the base:<ref>Tom Cooper [http://www.acig.info/artman/publish/article_203.shtml Kuwait Emergency], Air Combat Information Group</ref>\n* No.1 Squadron, Venom FB.Mk.1, based at Habbaniyah AB, CO Capt.

The [[airfield]] is served by two [[runway]]s 13,000 and {{convert|12000|ft|m}} long. Since 2004, it has been known as '''Camp Taqaddum'''. (\"Taqaddum\" is an Arabic word which means \"progress\".)\n\nThe airbase was originally built by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1952 as the subsidiary PLATEAU AIRFIELD of nearby [[RAF Habbaniya]], whose runway was inadequate for the larger long range and jet aircraft being introduced. The original RAF runway was subsequently extended by the Iraqis and a parallel runway added. Some of the RAF buildings ([[Nissen hut]]s) were still standing in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Iraqi Air Force use===\nAl Taqaddum Airbase was known as \"Tammuz Airbase\" (Tammuz being the [[Babylonian calendar|Babylonian]] month the [[Baath Party]] came to power in Iraq), and various [[Iraqi Air Force]] units and squadrons used it.\n\nThe airbase was bombed in [[Operation Kaman 99]], the day after the beginning of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nUnits and squadrons present before 2003:\n*[[14th Squadron (Iraq)|14th Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]  \n*[[73rd Squadron (Iraq)|73rd Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]  \n*[[6th Squadron (Iraq)|6th Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29]] \n*[[5th Squadron (Iraq)|5th Squadron]] [[Sukhoi Su-22]]\n*[[105th Squadron (Iraq)|105th Squadron]] [[Sukhoi Su-25]]s\n* [[109th Squadron (Iraq)|109th Squadron]] Sukhoi Su-25s\n\nFifty-one different Iraqi Air Force aircraft were found hidden under camouflage nets near al-Taqaddum by the [[Australian Special Air Service]]. Although still only scant details are known about these aircraft, US and British military sources reported that these 51 aircraft included three MiG-25s (including a single MiG-25PU two-seater), a Su-25K and a Su-7U, a MiG-29, several F-7Bs and Su-22UM-3Ks, as well as one Ilushin Il-76 transport.\n\nU.S. forces also found the hulks of five remaining Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tupolev Tu-22B \"Blinder\"]] supersonic bombers. All were still sitting in the revetments where they had been hit and destroyed by Coalition air attacks in 1991. Near them the wreckage of the Adnan-1 AEW aircraft, a third example was found, also destroyed by air attacks in 1991, as well as the wreck of the last Iraqi Tu-16 or H-6D bomber, which survived 1991, and was made operational in 2000 again: this old bomber was observed in flight \u2013 together with the sole surviving Iraqi Su-24MK \u2013 as late as February 2003, but was then obviously hit by US air strikes.\n\nThe last Iraqi Su-24MK was apparently captured intact, and there are rumours that it was meanwhile flown to the USA as well. Another rarity reported to have survived the war at al-Taqaddum were several Ilyushin Il-28 \"Beagle\" bombers, including one Il-28U training aircraft. Supplied to the IrAF in 1960, this aircraft must have certainly seen quite some service history: they were used during [[Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|the extensive campaigns]] against [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurdish]] rebels, in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War|1960s]], [[Second Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War|mid-1970s]], and [[Kurdish rebellion of 1983|mid-1980s]] during the war against Iran.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_375.shtml Second Death of IrAF]</ref>\n\n===Iraq War from 2003===\nThe Iraqi airbase was long-abandoned when [[United States|U.S.]] forces occupied it in March 2003. The [[U.S. Army]] started to refer to the base as Forward Operating Base (FOB) Ridgway. The first U.S. Battalion to occupy the base was the 142nd Corps Support Battalion. The primary mission of the 142nd was to provide logistical support to nearby non-divisional Army units. However, a consequential mission of the 800 soldier battalion was to guard the local Iraqi ammunition storage area that at one time supplied the ammunition requirements of the defunct Iraqi airbase. Aviation elements of the 3rd ACR occupied the airfield from April 2003 until replaced by 82nd Airborne Division in July 2003.\n\nIn 2004, the base name was changed to ''Camp Taqaddum'' to keep a more Iraqi face on the local military mission. \"TQ\" served as a major hub of men and materiel moving into Anbar province by coalition forces in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].\n\nAccording to the [[Gulf War Air Power Survey]], there were 24 [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter]]s at Al Taqaddum. At each end of the main runway are hardened aircraft shelters knowns as a HAS (pronounced Haas), \"trapezoids\" or \"Yugos\" which were built by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n contractors some time prior to 1985. Various units of the U.S. Army found numerous MIG-21, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG 25]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su 25]] [[Iraqi Air Force]] fighter jets partially buried in the area, presumably from the time of the [[Gulf War]]. By January 2004, almost all of the dozens of aircraft had been removed by the local citizens and burned, evidently, for scrap metal.\n\nThere are three \"sides\" to Al Taqaddum, \"Lake Side\", \"Main Side\", and \"Spring Lake\". These sides denote particular areas. Each area has its own chow hall and phone center. The PX and main military support services are located on \"Main Side\". \"Lake Side\" hosts the air terminal and the primary supply depot. \"Spring Lake\" hosts other logistics units.\n\nTQ is adjacent to [[Lake Habbaniyah]]. This lake varies in colors, blue some days, to a greenish tint on others. The base is built on a desolate plateau overlooking the Euphrates River to the north and Lake Habbaniyah to the south. A drainage canal from Lake Habbaniyah flows between it and the base at [[RAF Habbaniya|Habbaniyah]].\n\nIn late 2009 Al Taqaddum was turned back over to the Iraqi Military.\n\n====Greene Field====\nOn August 22, 2004, a group of Marines dedicated the airfield at Al Taqaddum to Lt. Col. David S.

The [[airfield]] is served by two [[runway]]s 13,000 and {{convert|12000|ft|m}} long. Since 2004, it has been known as '''Camp Taqaddum'''. (\"Taqaddum\" is an Arabic word which means \"progress\".)\n\nThe airbase was originally built by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1952 as the subsidiary PLATEAU AIRFIELD of nearby [[RAF Habbaniya]], whose runway was inadequate for the larger long range and jet aircraft being introduced. The original RAF runway was subsequently extended by the Iraqis and a parallel runway added. Some of the RAF buildings ([[Nissen hut]]s) were still standing in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Iraqi Air Force use===\nAl Taqaddum Airbase was known as \"Tammuz Airbase\" (Tammuz being the [[Babylonian calendar|Babylonian]] month the [[Baath Party]] came to power in Iraq), and various [[Iraqi Air Force]] units and squadrons used it.\n\nThe airbase was bombed in [[Operation Kaman 99]], the day after the beginning of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nUnits and squadrons present before 2003:\n*[[14th Squadron (Iraq)|14th Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]  \n*[[73rd Squadron (Iraq)|73rd Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]  \n*[[6th Squadron (Iraq)|6th Squadron]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29]] \n*[[5th Squadron (Iraq)|5th Squadron]] [[Sukhoi Su-22]]\n*[[105th Squadron (Iraq)|105th Squadron]] [[Sukhoi Su-25]]s\n* [[109th Squadron (Iraq)|109th Squadron]] Sukhoi Su-25s\n\nFifty-one different Iraqi Air Force aircraft were found hidden under camouflage nets near al-Taqaddum by the [[Australian Special Air Service]]. Although still only scant details are known about these aircraft, US and British military sources reported that these 51 aircraft included three MiG-25s (including a single MiG-25PU two-seater), a Su-25K and a Su-7U, a MiG-29, several F-7Bs and Su-22UM-3Ks, as well as one Ilushin Il-76 transport.\n\nU.S. forces also found the hulks of five remaining Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tupolev Tu-22B \"Blinder\"]] supersonic bombers. All were still sitting in the revetments where they had been hit and destroyed by Coalition air attacks in 1991. Near them the wreckage of the Adnan-1 AEW aircraft, a third example was found, also destroyed by air attacks in 1991, as well as the wreck of the last Iraqi Tu-16 or H-6D bomber, which survived 1991, and was made operational in 2000 again: this old bomber was observed in flight \u2013 together with the sole surviving Iraqi Su-24MK \u2013 as late as February 2003, but was then obviously hit by US air strikes.\n\nThe last Iraqi Su-24MK was apparently captured intact, and there are rumours that it was meanwhile flown to the USA as well. Another rarity reported to have survived the war at al-Taqaddum were several Ilyushin Il-28 \"Beagle\" bombers, including one Il-28U training aircraft. Supplied to the IrAF in 1960, this aircraft must have certainly seen quite some service history: they were used during [[Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|the extensive campaigns]] against [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurdish]] rebels, in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War|1960s]], [[Second Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War|mid-1970s]], and [[Kurdish rebellion of 1983|mid-1980s]] during the war against Iran.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_375.shtml Second Death of IrAF]</ref>\n\n===Iraq War from 2003===\nThe Iraqi airbase was long-abandoned when [[United States|U.S.]] forces occupied it in March 2003. The [[U.S. Army]] started to refer to the base as Forward Operating Base (FOB) Ridgway. The first U.S. Battalion to occupy the base was the 142nd Corps Support Battalion. The primary mission of the 142nd was to provide logistical support to nearby non-divisional Army units. However, a consequential mission of the 800 soldier battalion was to guard the local Iraqi ammunition storage area that at one time supplied the ammunition requirements of the defunct Iraqi airbase. Aviation elements of the 3rd ACR occupied the airfield from April 2003 until replaced by 82nd Airborne Division in July 2003.\n\nIn 2004, the base name was changed to ''Camp Taqaddum'' to keep a more Iraqi face on the local military mission. \"TQ\" served as a major hub of men and materiel moving into Anbar province by coalition forces in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].\n\nAccording to the [[Gulf War Air Power Survey]], there were 24 [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter]]s at Al Taqaddum. At each end of the main runway are hardened aircraft shelters knowns as a HAS (pronounced Haas), \"trapezoids\" or \"Yugos\" which were built by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n contractors some time prior to 1985. Various units of the U.S. Army found numerous MIG-21, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG 25]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su 25]] [[Iraqi Air Force]] fighter jets partially buried in the area, presumably from the time of the [[Gulf War]]. By January 2004, almost all of the dozens of aircraft had been removed by the local citizens and burned, evidently, for scrap metal.\n\nThere are three \"sides\" to Al Taqaddum, \"Lake Side\", \"Main Side\", and \"Spring Lake\". These sides denote particular areas. Each area has its own chow hall and phone center. The PX and main military support services are located on \"Main Side\". \"Lake Side\" hosts the air terminal and the primary supply depot. \"Spring Lake\" hosts other logistics units.\n\nTQ is adjacent to [[Lake Habbaniyah]]. This lake varies in colors, blue some days, to a greenish tint on others. The base is built on a desolate plateau overlooking the Euphrates River to the north and Lake Habbaniyah to the south. A drainage canal from Lake Habbaniyah flows between it and the base at [[RAF Habbaniya|Habbaniyah]].\n\nIn late 2009 Al Taqaddum was turned back over to the Iraqi Military.\n\n====Greene Field====\nOn August 22, 2004, a group of Marines dedicated the airfield at Al Taqaddum to Lt. Col. David S. Greene, a reserve Marine AH-1W Super Cobra pilot with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 775, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, who was killed in action July 28, 2004.
