The plot focuses on a [[French Canadian]] model whose separated [[conjoined twin]] is suspected of a brutal murder witnessed by a newspaper reporter in [[Staten Island]].\n\nCo-written by De Palma and Louisa Rose, the screenplay for the film was inspired by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Conjoined twins [[Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova]] and features narrative and visual references to several films by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/articles/unamerican-psycho-brian-de-palma-and-the-political,83700/|work=The AV Club|title=Un-American Psycho: Brian De Palma And The Political Invisible |author=Semley, John|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Filmed on location in Staten Island, [[New York City]], the film prominently features [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] compositions (also present in subsequent De Palma films such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''), and was scored by frequent Hitchcock collaborator [[Bernard Herrmann]]. \n\nReleased in the spring of 1973, ''Sisters'' received praise from critics who noted its adept performances and prominent use of [[homage (arts)|homage]]. It marked the first thriller for De Palma, who followed it with other shocking, graphic thrillers, and went on to become a [[cult following|cult film]] in the years after its release.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Plot==\nAdvertising salesman Philip Woode is the victim of a prank on a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-style television show and wins a dinner for two at a [[Manhattan]] restaurant. He takes with him Danielle Breton, a naive young [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] model and aspiring actress who was hired as part of the prank. At dinner, they are interrupted by Danielle's ex-husband, Emil, who also follows them to Danielle's [[Staten Island]] apartment, where Philip and Danielle make love.\n\nThe next morning, Philip overhears an argument between Danielle and her sister and accidentally knocks Danielle's pills down a drain. Danielle explains to Philip that her twin sister Dominique had arrived to celebrate their birthday. She asks him to go to the drug store to pick up some more pills. He does so, and also buys a birthday cake for the two. When he returns, he is suddenly stabbed to death by a crazed and delirious Dominique.\n\nGrace Collier, a reporter who lives in an apartment across the way, witnesses the murder and calls the police. While Grace waits in the lobby for the police, Emil helps Danielle clean up the blood and hide Philip's body in the sleeper sofa. Grace accompanies the police on a search through Danielle's apartment, who testifies that she had been alone all morning and the previous night. They find no evidence, though Grace finds the birthday cake with Danielle's and Dominique's names written on it, but trips and destroys the cake before she can show it to the detectives.\n\nCertain that Danielle is hiding the murderer, Grace persuades her editor to let her investigate the story. She is assisted by Larch, a private investigator, who deduces that the body is hidden inside the couch. When the couch is hauled away by a moving company, Larch pursues them. Grace uncovers that Danielle and Dominique Blanchion were Canada's first [[conjoined twins]]. Dominique was very shy while Danielle was talkative and outgoing. They were separated only recently, but Dominique died during the operation. Grace then tails Emil and Danielle to a mental hospital and witnesses him subdue and sedate her, but is caught. Emil, a doctor at the hospital, convinces the staff that Grace is a new patient and has her locked in a room where he hypnotizes her, telling her that the murder did not happen.\n\nGrace has a bizarre dream about the twins' past and their separation where she herself is Dominique. In the same room, Emil fondles Danielle as he reminds her how their marriage was ruined because Danielle would dissociate to a violent \"Dominique\" personality whenever they made love. Danielle refuses to believe it, but when she and Emil kiss passionately, \"Dominique\" takes control of Danielle once again. When Emil attempts to interrogate her about the murder, she cuts him in the inner groin with a scalpel and he bleeds to death over her. Grace awakens to find Danielle, now back in control, tenderly holding Emil's bloody body, and screams in horror. The police arrest a delusional Danielle, who denies her responsibility for the murders and says that her sister is dead.\n\nWhen Grace is interviewed by the police she denies that she saw Woods's murder; she is still under Emil's hypnotic spell. Meanwhile, Larch has followed the sofa to a derelict train station in Canada.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Margot Kidder]] as Danielle Breton / Dominique Blanchion\n*[[Jennifer Salt]] as Grace Collier\n*[[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Emil Breton\n*[[Charles Durning]] as Joseph Larch\n*[[Lisle Wilson]] as Phillip Woode\n*[[Barnard Hughes]] as Arthur McLennen\n*Mary Davenport as Mrs. Peyson Collier\n*[[Dolph Sweet]] as Detective Kelly\n*[[Olympia Dukakis]] as Louise Wilanski \n*Catherine Gaffigan as Arlene \n*[[Justine Johnston]] as Elaine D'Anna \n*James Mapes as Guard \n*Burt Richards as Hospital Attendant \n*Bill Durks as a Sanitorium resident\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nScholarly discussion of ''Sisters'' has centered largely on its prevalent theme of [[voyeurism]] as well as a perceived commentary on the [[women's liberation movement]].{{sfn|Wood|2003|pages=134\u2013136}} Film critic and scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the film \"analyzes the ways in which women are oppressed within patriarchy society on two levels, the professional (Grace) and the psychosexual (Danielle/Dominique).\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}} He adds: \"If the monster is defined as that which threatens normality, it follows that the monster of ''Sisters'' is Grace as well as Danielle/Dominique{{en dash}}a point the film acknowledges in a cinematic hallucination/flashback sequence wherein Grace becomes Dominique...&nbsp; Simply, one can define the monster of ''Sisters'' as [[women's liberation]].\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}}\n\nThe prominent allusions to works by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] have also been noted by critics such as Bruce Kawin, who wrote in 2000: {{quote|''Sisters''...&nbsp;  makes intelligent reference to ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and even ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920). The film ends with a shot of a detective looking through binoculars at what might be called the scene of the crime, intently but fruitlessly watching a couch that no one will ever incriminate themselves with by picking up.

The plot focuses on a [[French Canadian]] model whose separated [[conjoined twin]] is suspected of a brutal murder witnessed by a newspaper reporter in [[Staten Island]].\n\nCo-written by De Palma and Louisa Rose, the screenplay for the film was inspired by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Conjoined twins [[Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova]] and features narrative and visual references to several films by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/articles/unamerican-psycho-brian-de-palma-and-the-political,83700/|work=The AV Club|title=Un-American Psycho: Brian De Palma And The Political Invisible |author=Semley, John|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Filmed on location in Staten Island, [[New York City]], the film prominently features [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] compositions (also present in subsequent De Palma films such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''), and was scored by frequent Hitchcock collaborator [[Bernard Herrmann]]. \n\nReleased in the spring of 1973, ''Sisters'' received praise from critics who noted its adept performances and prominent use of [[homage (arts)|homage]]. It marked the first thriller for De Palma, who followed it with other shocking, graphic thrillers, and went on to become a [[cult following|cult film]] in the years after its release.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Plot==\nAdvertising salesman Philip Woode is the victim of a prank on a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-style television show and wins a dinner for two at a [[Manhattan]] restaurant. He takes with him Danielle Breton, a naive young [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] model and aspiring actress who was hired as part of the prank. At dinner, they are interrupted by Danielle's ex-husband, Emil, but Philip has him thrown out by security. They arrive at Danielle's [[Staten Island]] apartment, but they spot Emil waiting outside. Philip pretends to leave to lure him away, then returns through the back entrance and the two make love on the living-room sofa.\n\nThe next morning, Danielle wakes and feels unwell. Philip overhears an argument between her and her sister in the bedroom, and accidentally knocks Danielle's pills down a drain. Danielle explains to Philip that her twin sister Dominique had arrived to visit because it is their birthday, and also asks him to go to the drug store to pick up some more pills. He does so, and also buys a birthday cake for the two. When he returns, he is suddenly stabbed to death by Dominique, who is crazed and delirious.\n\nThe murder is witnessed by Grace Collier, a reporter who lives in an apartment across the way, who calls the police. Emil knocks on Danielle's door and finds the scene, then helps Danielle clean up the blood and hide Philip's body in the retractable couch. Two detectives arrive but are unhelpful and resentful toward Grace because of an article she had previously written about [[police brutality]]. Grace accompanies them on a search through Danielle's apartment, who testifies that she had been alone all morning and the previous night. They find no evidence, though Grace finds the birthday cake with Danielle's and Dominique's names written on it, but trips and destroys the cake before she can show it to the detectives.\n\nGrace is convinced that Danielle is hiding the murderer, and convinces her editor to let her investigate the story. He agrees, but forces her to take along Joseph Larch, a private investigator. He searches Danielle's apartment under the guise of a window cleaner, and is convinced that the body is hidden inside the couch due to its unnatural weight, but is interrupted by moving men who are directed to remove the couch. Larch follows the moving truck, while Grace uncovers that Danielle and Dominique Blanchion were Canada's first [[conjoined twins]]. Dominique was very shy while Danielle was talkative and outgoing. They were separated only recently, but Dominique died during the operation. Grace then tails Emil and Danielle to a mental hospital and witnesses him subdue and sedate her, but is caught. Emil, a doctor at the hospital, convinces the staff that Grace is a new patient and has her locked in a room where he hypnotizes her, telling her that the murder did not happen.\n\nGrace has a bizarre dream about the twins' past and their separation where she herself is Dominique. She wakes screaming hysterically only to have Emil coax her back to sleep. Danielle says that she wants Dominique while Emil reminds her that Dominique is dead. Danielle refuses to believe it, afraid Dominique will kill him. Emil makes her relax and tells her that whenever he tried to make love to her, Dominique's angry persona took control over her and all he could do was give her the pills to keep her sedated. Emil tells Danielle that he loves her and they kiss passionately. Dominique takes control of Danielle once again. After a struggle, Emil attempts to interrogate her about the murder but she cuts him in the inner groin with a scalpel and he bleeds to death over her. Danielle reawakens with Emil lying dead on top of her and embraces his body. Grace awakens too, and when she sees Danielle hugging the dead Emil, she screams in horror. The police arrest a delusional Danielle, who denies her responsibility for the murders and says that her sister is dead.\n\nLater, Grace is interviewed by one of the detectives she called about Woode's murder, who now believes her. But still under Emil's hypnosis, she completely denies her previous accusations. The final scene shows Larch, watching the sofa at a derelict train station in Canada while perched on a telephone pole.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Margot Kidder]] as Danielle Breton / Dominique Blanchion\n*[[Jennifer Salt]] as Grace Collier\n*[[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Emil Breton\n*[[Charles Durning]] as Joseph Larch\n*[[Lisle Wilson]] as Phillip Woode\n*[[Barnard Hughes]] as Arthur McLennen\n*Mary Davenport as Mrs. Peyson Collier\n*[[Dolph Sweet]] as Detective Kelly\n*[[Olympia Dukakis]] as Louise Wilanski \n*Catherine Gaffigan as Arlene \n*[[Justine Johnston]] as Elaine D'Anna \n*James Mapes as Guard \n*Burt Richards as Hospital Attendant \n*Bill Durks as a Sanitorium resident\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nScholarly discussion of ''Sisters'' has centered largely on its prevalent theme of [[voyeurism]] as well as a perceived commentary on the [[women's liberation movement]].{{sfn|Wood|2003|pages=134\u2013136}} Film critic and scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the film \"analyzes the ways in which women are oppressed within patriarchy society on two levels, the professional (Grace) and the psychosexual (Danielle/Dominique).\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}} He adds: \"If the monster is defined as that which threatens normality, it follows that the monster of ''Sisters'' is Grace as well as Danielle/Dominique{{en dash}}a point the film acknowledges in a cinematic hallucination/flashback sequence wherein Grace becomes Dominique...&nbsp; Simply, one can define the monster of ''Sisters'' as [[women's liberation]].\"{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=134}}\n\nThe prominent allusions to works by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] have also been noted by critics such as Bruce Kawin, who wrote in 2000: {{quote|''Sisters''...&nbsp;  makes intelligent reference to ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and even ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920). The film ends with a shot of a detective looking through binoculars at what might be called the scene of the crime, intently but fruitlessly watching a couch that no one will ever incriminate themselves with by picking up. From start to finish, Sisters is charged with scenes of looking\u2014from seeing a murder through a window to seeing another person\u2019s memories in one\u2019s own mind.<ref name=kawin/>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDe Palma was inspired to write the screenplay for ''Sisters'' after reading an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1966 about the lives of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Siamese twins [[Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova]]: {{quote|At the end of the article there was a picture of the two girls sitting on a couch and the caption said that apart from the fact that they were joined at the hip both girls were physiologically normal, but as they were getting older they were developing psychological problems.

And this strong visual image started the whole idea off in my mind.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}}}}\n\nThe script, which De Palma co-wrote with Louisa Rose, features structural elements inspired by Hitchcock, such as killing off a prominent character early into the film, alternating points of view, and the involvement of a third party observer in solving a crime.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}} In writing the exposition of the film which details the twins' history and institutionalization, De Palma was influenced by [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), specifically the scene in which Rosemary is raped and conceives her child.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=3}}\n\n===Filming===\n''Sisters'' was shot over a period of eight weeks in [[New York City]] in spring 1972,<ref name=afi/> primarily in the borough of [[Staten Island]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} The apartment interiors were filmed on a set, with additional exterior photography of the [[1271 Avenue of the Americas|Time-Life Building]] in [[Manhattan]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} The film was shot using [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell BNC camera]]s with [[Panavision]] lenses.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} According to De Palma, the film was lit with a \"truly classical style\", with scenes sometimes taking 45 minutes to set up.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}} Some sequences were shot on [[16 mm film]] by De Palma himself, such as the scene in which Emil speaks directly to the camera during the finale's hallucination sequence.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=12}}\n\n===Visual style===\nThe film uses unusual [[point of view shot]]s and [[Split screen (film)|split screen]] effects to show two events happening simultaneously,<ref name=kawin>{{cite web|author=Kawin, Bruce|work=The Current|publisher=The Criterion Collection|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/90-sisters|title=Sisters|date=October 2, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122324/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/90-sisters|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=9}} as well as long [[tracking shot]]s,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Sisters review \u2013 Philip French on Brian De Palma's Hitchcock-indebted 1973 classic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/22/sisters-review-philip-french-brian-de-palma-hitchcock|author=French, Philip|date=June 21, 2014|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> some in excess of six minutes in length.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=7}} The extended tracking shot in Danielle's apartment following the murder of Phillip was influenced by [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] and directly references Hitchcock's ''Rope''.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=7}} The theme of voyeurism is represented in the alternating points-of-view and distortions of perspective within the narrative [[diegesis]]; De Palma commented: \"I really got the idea from watching the [[Vietnam war]] on television{{en dash}}watching a war that nobody really knew about except that we watched it every night on the 7 o'clock news.

And those can be manipulated.\"{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=10}}\n\nIn order to accomplish the image of both twins conjoined onscreen in the film's finale (both played by Kidder), De Palma had Kidder photographed seated in two different positions, and then joined the images together via [[Optical filter|optical editing]].{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=11}}\n\n===Musical score===\nWhile editing the film in post-production, editor Paul Hirsch and De Palma listened to musical scores by [[Bernard Herrmann]] (particularly for ''Psycho'', ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'') and played them along with the film's key scenes.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2003|p=4}} This led to De Palma inquiring about Herrmann composing the film's musical score.

The training flight involved a descent and [[instrument approach|approach]] to Nellis Air Force Base under simulated [[instrument meteorological conditions]] from an altitude of {{convert|28000|ft}}. The descent was to be a \"teardrop pattern,\" with the Las Vegas commercial radio station KRAM as the [[fix (position)|navigational fix]], a process that was referred to as the \"KRAM procedure.\"{{#tag:ref|\"The KRAM procedure was designed by the command of the Nellis Air Force Base as a procedure to descend from an altitude of 20,000 feet or above to an altitude of 6,000 feet, using as a 'fix' for initiating and concluding the penetration a commercial broadcast radio station (KRAM) located within the boundaries of Civil Airway Victor 8.  The procedure prescribed that the Nellis jets, on approaching KRAM, get a clearance for the KRAM penetration from Nellis [[visual flight rules|VFR]] Control, cross KRAM at 20,000 feet or above, descend on a magnetic track of 170 degrees at 300 knots [[indicated air speed]] (approximately the equivalent of 430 knots or 495 miles per hour true or actual air speed under the atmospheric conditions prevailing on the morning of April 21, 1958 at 21,000 feet) to an altitude of 11,000 feet within 16 nautical miles of KRAM. Upon reaching 11,000 feet on a magnetic track of 170 degrees, the procedure prescribed a right turn of 1\u00bd degrees per second and a [[bank angle|bank]] of 30 degrees, and a crossing of the KRAM station at an altitude of 6,000 feet. During the descent it was prescribed that the [[air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]] be extended.

The training flight involved a descent and [[instrument approach|approach]] to Nellis Air Force Base under simulated [[instrument meteorological conditions]] from an altitude of {{convert|28000|ft}}.

The procedure prescribed that the Nellis jets, on approaching KRAM, get a clearance for the KRAM penetration from Nellis [[visual flight rules|VFR]] Control, cross KRAM at 20,000 feet or above, descend on a magnetic track of 170 degrees at 300 knots [[indicated air speed]] (approximately the equivalent of 430 knots or 495 miles per hour true or actual air speed under the atmospheric conditions prevailing on the morning of April 21, 1958 at 21,000 feet) to an altitude of 11,000 feet within 16 nautical miles of KRAM. Upon reaching 11,000 feet on a magnetic track of 170 degrees, the procedure prescribed a right turn of 1\u00bd degrees per second and a [[bank angle|bank]] of 30 degrees, and a crossing of the KRAM station at an altitude of 6,000 feet. During the descent it was prescribed that the [[air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]] be extended.

He was [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]] from 1756 to 1788. Murray had already been created '''Baron Mansfield''', in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The two earldoms were created with different remainders. The 1776 earldom was created with remainder to Louisa Murray (n\u00e9e Cathcart), Viscountess Stormont (daughter of [[Charles Schaw Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart]]), second wife of his nephew [[David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield|David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont]], while the 1792 earldom, referring to a fictitious Mansfield in Middlesex to differentiate it from the first earldom,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. viii, p. 388, footnote (d)</ref> was created with remainder to his nephew the Viscount of Stormont.\n\nLord Mansfield was childless and on his death in 1793, the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the 1776 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew's wife Louisa, the second Countess, and in the 1792 earldom according to the special remainder by his nephew Lord Stormont, who became the second Earl. The latter was a noted politician in his own right and served as [[Lord Justice General]], [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]] and [[Lord President of the Council]]. He was succeeded by his and the Countess of Mansfield's son, the third Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was [[Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire]]. On his death, the title passed to his son, the fourth Earl (of the 1792 creation). He was a [[Tory]] politician and served as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1834 to 1835 in the [[Tory Government 1834-1835|first administration]] of [[Sir Robert Peel]]. In 1843, he succeeded his grandmother the Countess of Mansfield (who had outlived her husband by forty-seven years) and became in addition the third Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation.\n\nHe was succeeded by his grandson, the fifth and fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of William David Murray, Viscount of Stormont. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and fifth Earl. His son, the seventh and sixth Earl, represented [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire]]. The [[William Murray, 8th Earl of Mansfield|eighth and seventh Earl of Mansfield]] held office in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a [[Minister of State]] at the [[Scottish Office]] from 1979 to 1983, and at the [[Northern Ireland Office]] from 1983 to 1984. The titles are presently held by his elder son, the ninth Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation and the eighth Earl of Mansfield of the 1776 creation. He is also the fifteenth [[Viscount of Stormont]], the fifteenth Lord Scone and the thirteenth [[Lord Balvaird]].\n\nThe family seat is [[Scone Palace]], near [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], [[Perthshire]].
