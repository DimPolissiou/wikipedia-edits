He is best known as the voice of [[Cobra Commander]] in the ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I.

He had a few guest roles in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', and many roles in several [[television]] series and [[film]]s. He also had a successful [[stand-up comedy]] career.\n\n==Early life==\nChristopher Lawrence Latta was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]] to Robert Latta, a New York stage actor, and Jane Morin, an advertising executive. He grew up in the [[Morningside Heights]] (sometimes called \"West Harlem\") section of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. His legal name became Christopher Charles Collins when his stepfather adopted him. In his stand-up routine, he claimed to have grown up in [[Harlem]] and said his ultra-liberal parents had moved the family there \"so he could meet some Negroes\".\n\nAfter a year at [[New York University]], he studied acting, dance, voice and mime.\n\n==Career==\nIn the mid-1970s, he acted on the New York and [[Boston]] stage and did voice-over work for Boston radio station [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]].\n\n===Voice acting===\nCollins made his animation voice acting debut as one of the English dubbers of the 1979 [[anime]] series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (also called ''[[Star Blazers]]''). He was most recognizable in that series as the voice of space marine Sgt. Knox during the Comet Empire installment.\n\nWhen he began regular voice work, he adopted the [[stage name]] Chris Collins, as another [[Screen Actors Guild]] actor was already performing as Chris Latta.\n\nIn 1983, Collins started voicing [[Cobra Commander]] for a five-part ''G.I. Joe'' animated miniseries. In 1984, he reprised the role for a second five-part animated mini-series, which became a regular series in 1985. Also in 1984, Collins voiced a new character, [[Starscream]], for a three-part ''Transformers'' animated miniseries. By 1985, he was voicing other G.I. Joe and Transformers characters in toy commercials, carrying on in those roles when the two television series made their debut. He voiced the Autobot scientist Wheeljack, the Autobots' human friend [[Witwicky family#Sparkplug Witwicky|Sparkplug Witwicky]], and the G.I. Joe Marine [[Gung-Ho (G.I. Joe)|Gung-Ho]]. In ''[[Inhumanoids]]'', he voiced D'Compose and Tendril, ''[[Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light]]'', where he voiced Darkstorm and Cravex. \n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Collins originated the voice of [[Mr. Burns]] in the first-season episodes \"[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]\", \"[[The Telltale Head]]\", and \"[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]\", and recorded lines (but was dubbed over in the latter) as [[Moe Szyslak]] for \"The Telltale Head\" and \"[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]\". Along with several other early ''Simpsons'' voice actors, he left during the first season. [[Hank Azaria]] took over the voice of Moe, while [[Harry Shearer]] assumed the role of Mr. Burns.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=XF8nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201 |title=Television Series of the 1980s: Essential Facts and Quirky Details |first=Vincent |last=Terrace |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |date=10 November 2017 |page=201 |isbn=9781442278318}}</ref> In a 2018 interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Azaria commented on replacing Collins as Moe, saying that he did not find out until years later that he had replaced another actor. Azaria said that when he asked why he had replaced Collins, he was told by [[Matt Groening]], \"He (Collins) was great... He was just a dick.  His voice was great, he was just kind of jerky to everyone.\" Azaria continued, \"Think about how awful\u2014that guy could have been on ''The Simpsons'' his whole life. Lesson to you kids: Always be nice!\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5TaYFi4UVA | title=GQ interview, Hank Azaria Breaks Down his Iconic Simpsons and Movie Roles }}</ref>\n\n===Live action===\nLater in the 1980s, Collins began working as Christopher Collins and acted in many live-action television series and motion pictures. He played [[Klingon]] Captain Kargan and Pakled [[Samaritan Snare|Captain Grebnedlog]] in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[A Matter of Honor]]\". Collins went on to portray two different Markalians on ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'': first [[The Passenger (DS9 episode)|Durg]], and then an unnamed assistant to [[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Albino]]. In ''[[Married... with Children]]'', he played Roger, one of [[Al Bundy]]'s bowling buddies and a member of NO MA'AM (National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood).

His daughter Abigail accepted on his behalf, to a standing ovation.\n\n===Stand-up comedy===\nCollins' stand-up career peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when he performed in most of the major comedy venues in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In 1990, he won the San Francisco International Stand-Up Comedy Competition.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the beginning of his act, he entered in a black [[trench coat]] and order the audience to applaud the person who introduced him. Afterwards, he would pick out an audience member who failed to applaud and tell him he had to \"clap alone\". He later told the audience he was not a comedian, but a \"[[psychosis|psychotic]] who learned to market his problem\". \n\nHe was a frequent featured performer on ''[[An Evening at the Improv]]'' and ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nCollins married twice and had three children. Early in his career, he divided his time between New York, Boston, and [[Los Angeles]] before settling in L.A. in 1983. In 1991, he moved to [[Ventura, California]].\n\nIn an interview, [[Flint Dille]] recalled: {{quote|There was one summer when I had to bail Chris Latta out of the Hollywood jail in order to get him to the recording on time.
