By 1974, Communicators Inc. of Iowa had been renamed KRNA, Inc., and the company was granted [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approval to begin broadcasting. KRNA began broadcasting at 93.5 FM on October 4, 1974. (KRNA later moved to 93.9 FM in 1979 before moving to its present 94.1 FM at 9 a.m. on October 14, 1991.) By January 1975, [[Arbitron]] telephone surveys showed that nearly half of local radio listeners were tuned into KRNA. As part of its \"major market sound\", KRNA pre-recorded its commercial announcements during a time when most commercials were read live on the air, and it also broadcast 24 hours a day while other radio stations signed off during the overnight hours for equipment maintenance.<ref>Stein, 111.</ref>\n\nIn 1994, KRNA purchased the former [[KZIA|KQCR]] radio (102.9 FM) in Cedar Rapids to create the area's first radio [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]].

[[Al Rinker|Al]] and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer [[Mildred Bailey]]), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers,<ref name=bicrdha/> who performed at dances both for high-school students and club-goers.

Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called 'The Three Harmony Aces' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men \u2013 Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell \u2013 and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\">{{cite book|first=Malcolm|last=Macfarlane|title=Bing Crosby: Day by Day|year=2001 |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm |website=Bingmagazine.co.uk }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1925, Crosby and Rinker decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles, where Bailey introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue ''The Syncopation Idea'' starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the [[Loews Theatres|Loew's circuit]]. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of ''The Syncopation Idea'' Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After ''The Syncopation Idea'' closed, they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by a member of the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization. Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\"/> Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was \"I've Got the Girl\" with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&nbsp;rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html |title=Paul Whiteman's Original Rhythm Boys |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Rhythm Boys===\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made the difference, and \"[[The Rhythm Boys]]\" were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]], and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macfarlane| first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby \u2013 Day by Day| url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm#Chapter_3|website=BING magazine|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928 he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of \"[[Ol' Man River]]\". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film ''[[King of Jazz]]'' with Whiteman, but Crosby's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra, performing nightly in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's hits, including \"At Your Command\", \"[[I Surrender Dear]]\", and \"[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]\". When [[Mack Sennett]] signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married [[Dixie Lee]] in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.\n\n===Success as a solo singer===\n[[File:Bing Crosby - Modern Screen, September 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in 1932]]\nOn September 2, 1931, Crosby made his nationwide [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby|solo radio debut]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |title=Bing Crosby, Singer |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}</ref> Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and [[CBS Radio]].

A \"Battle of the Baritones\" with singer [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan \"Bing Was King\". Crosby played the lead in a series of [[I Surrender Dear (1931 film)|musical comedy short films]] for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'' (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]], in late 1934.\n\nHis first commercial sponsor on radio was [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby#Bing Crosby \u2013 The Cremo Singer|Cremo Cigars]] and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]''. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] stated, \"By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/bing-crosby-bing-his-legendary-years-hows-the-sound.153459/ |title=Bing Crosby- Bing!

His first son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]] was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', where he remained for the next ten years. \"[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]\", with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.\n\nCrosby's vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the \"[[belt (music)|belting]]\" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called \"singing in American\" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet \"[[crooner]]\".\n\nCrosby admired [[Louis Armstrong]] for his musical ability, and the trumpet maestro was a formative influence on Crosby's singing style. When the two met, they immediately became friends. In 1936, Crosby exercised an option in his Paramount contract to regularly star in an out-of-house film. Signing an agreement with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] for a single motion picture, Crosby wanted Armstrong to appear in a screen adaptation of ''The Peacock Feather'' that eventually  became ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. Crosby asked [[Harry Cohn]], but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong's \"crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]].\" Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss the matter. Cohn gave in; Armstrong's musical scenes and comic dialogue extended his influence to the silver screen, creating more opportunities for him and other African Americans to appear in future films. Crosby also ensured behind the scenes that Armstrong received equal billing with his white co-stars. Armstrong appreciated Crosby's progressive attitudes on race, and often expressed gratitude for the role in later years.<ref name=\"Pennies\">{{cite web |title=Pennies from Heaven (1936) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7c111410/Pennies-from-Heaven.html|website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname \"Der Bingle\" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].\n\nThe June 18, 1945, issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine stated, \"America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history.

He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future.

(A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his movie ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942). His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.&nbsp;1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks.

The series consists of ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures, ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.\n\nIn the 1949 Disney animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment. In 1960, he starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a lengthy and elaborate cameo appearance.<ref name=\"kl.\" /> Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned another ''Road'' film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nHe won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''.

But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]], and [[country music]], and top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and ballads.{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=cassette 1, side B}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenlewis.info/crosby/jackapp.htm |title=Jack Kapp \u2013 Bing Crosby Internet Museum |website=Stevenlewis.info|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or the art of making a song's lyric ring true. \"I used to tell Sinatra over and over,\" said Tommy Dorsey, \"there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby.

(The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\n{{quote|[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.}}\n\nCrosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.<ref>Hammar, Peter.

But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945\u20131946 season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. ABC was formed from the sale of the [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 after a federal [[antitrust]] suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400&nbsp;independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) [[Acetate disc|lacquer discs]] that played ten minutes per side at 33{{sfrac|1|3}} rpm.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]\n\nCrosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for golf. He did record his first ''[[Philco Radio Time]]'' program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September when the radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason. He wanted better quality recording, the ability to eliminate mistakes and the need to perform a second live show for the West Coast, and to control the timing of his performances.<ref name=RW /> Because Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the best audio equipment and arrange the microphones his way; microphone placement had been debated in studios since the beginning of the electrical era. He would no longer have to wear the toupee that CBS and NBC required for his live audience shows\u2014he preferred a hat. He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed him to make more money by finding a loophole where the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nMurdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947\u2014the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered [[Ampex]], which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.\n\nCrosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50&nbsp;reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:\n{{quote|By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.}}\n\nMullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:\n{{quote|In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it\u2014thought it was very funny\u2014but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.}}\n\nCrosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines.<ref name=\"Sterling, C. H. 1990\"/> In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200A and Scotch 111 tape from [[3M]].<ref name=RW /> Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:\n\n{{quote|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.}}\n\nCrosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist [[Les Paul]], which led to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. ''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.\n\nCrosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R.

He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.\n\nCrosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].\n\nCrosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in [[Cockermouth]] and fishing on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]]. His trip was filmed for ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although all did not go well at first as the [[salmon]] were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of [[sea trout]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trouthotel.co.uk/journal/bing-crosby-came-stay/ | title=When Bing Crosby came to stay |publisher=Trout Hotel Web |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Crosby Brothers-older sons of Bing Crosby 1959.JPG|thumb|Crosby's sons from his first marriage.

When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the [[California Civil Code]], Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as [[community property]] under California law.<ref>''Crosby v.

[[Al Rinker|Al]] and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer [[Mildred Bailey]]), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers,<ref name=bicrdha/> who performed at dances both for high-school students and club-goers.

Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called 'The Three Harmony Aces' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men \u2013 Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell \u2013 and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\">{{cite book|first=Malcolm|last=Macfarlane|title=Bing Crosby: Day by Day|year=2001 |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm |website=Bingmagazine.co.uk }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1925, Crosby and Rinker decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles, where Bailey introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue ''The Syncopation Idea'' starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the [[Loews Theatres|Loew's circuit]]. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of ''The Syncopation Idea'' Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After ''The Syncopation Idea'' closed, they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by a member of the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization. Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\"/> Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was \"I've Got the Girl\" with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&nbsp;rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html |title=Paul Whiteman's Original Rhythm Boys |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Rhythm Boys===\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made the difference, and \"[[The Rhythm Boys]]\" were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]], and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macfarlane| first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby \u2013 Day by Day| url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm#Chapter_3|website=BING magazine|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928 he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of \"[[Ol' Man River]]\". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film ''[[King of Jazz]]'' with Whiteman, but Crosby's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra, performing nightly in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's hits, including \"At Your Command\", \"[[I Surrender Dear]]\", and \"[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]\". When [[Mack Sennett]] signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married [[Dixie Lee]] in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.\n\n===Success as a solo singer===\n[[File:Bing Crosby - Modern Screen, September 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in 1932]]\nOn September 2, 1931, Crosby made his nationwide [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby|solo radio debut]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |title=Bing Crosby, Singer |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}</ref> Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and [[CBS Radio]].

A \"Battle of the Baritones\" with singer [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan \"Bing Was King\". Crosby played the lead in a series of [[I Surrender Dear (1931 film)|musical comedy short films]] for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'' (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]], in late 1934.\n\nHis first commercial sponsor on radio was [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby#Bing Crosby \u2013 The Cremo Singer|Cremo Cigars]] and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]''. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] stated, \"By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/bing-crosby-bing-his-legendary-years-hows-the-sound.153459/ |title=Bing Crosby- Bing!

His first son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]] was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', where he remained for the next ten years. \"[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]\", with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.\n\nCrosby's vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the \"[[belt (music)|belting]]\" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called \"singing in American\" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet \"[[crooner]]\".\n\nCrosby admired [[Louis Armstrong]] for his musical ability, and the trumpet maestro was a formative influence on Crosby's singing style. When the two met, they immediately became friends. In 1936, Crosby exercised an option in his Paramount contract to regularly star in an out-of-house film. Signing an agreement with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] for a single motion picture, Crosby wanted Armstrong to appear in a screen adaptation of ''The Peacock Feather'' that eventually  became ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. Crosby asked [[Harry Cohn]], but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong's \"crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]].\" Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss the matter. Cohn gave in; Armstrong's musical scenes and comic dialogue extended his influence to the silver screen, creating more opportunities for him and other African Americans to appear in future films. Crosby also ensured behind the scenes that Armstrong received equal billing with his white co-stars. Armstrong appreciated Crosby's progressive attitudes on race, and often expressed gratitude for the role in later years.<ref name=\"Pennies\">{{cite web |title=Pennies from Heaven (1936) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7c111410/Pennies-from-Heaven.html|website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname \"Der Bingle\" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].\n\nThe June 18, 1945, issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine stated, \"America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history.

He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future.

(A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his movie ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942). His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.&nbsp;1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks.

The series consists of ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures, ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.\n\nIn the 1949 Disney animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment. In 1960, he starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a lengthy and elaborate cameo appearance.<ref name=\"kl.\" /> Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned another ''Road'' film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nHe won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''.

But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]], and [[country music]], and top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and ballads.{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=cassette 1, side B}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenlewis.info/crosby/jackapp.htm |title=Jack Kapp \u2013 Bing Crosby Internet Museum |website=Stevenlewis.info|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or the art of making a song's lyric ring true. \"I used to tell Sinatra over and over,\" said Tommy Dorsey, \"there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby.

(The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\n{{quote|[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.}}\n\nCrosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.<ref>Hammar, Peter.

But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945\u20131946 season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. ABC was formed from the sale of the [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 after a federal [[antitrust]] suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400&nbsp;independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) [[Acetate disc|lacquer discs]] that played ten minutes per side at 33{{sfrac|1|3}} rpm.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]\n\nCrosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for golf. He did record his first ''[[Philco Radio Time]]'' program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September when the radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason. He wanted better quality recording, the ability to eliminate mistakes and the need to perform a second live show for the West Coast, and to control the timing of his performances.<ref name=RW /> Because Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the best audio equipment and arrange the microphones his way; microphone placement had been debated in studios since the beginning of the electrical era. He would no longer have to wear the toupee that CBS and NBC required for his live audience shows\u2014he preferred a hat. He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed him to make more money by finding a loophole where the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nMurdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947\u2014the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered [[Ampex]], which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.\n\nCrosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50&nbsp;reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:\n{{quote|By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.}}\n\nMullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:\n{{quote|In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it\u2014thought it was very funny\u2014but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.}}\n\nCrosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines.<ref name=\"Sterling, C. H. 1990\"/> In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200A and Scotch 111 tape from [[3M]].<ref name=RW /> Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:\n\n{{quote|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.}}\n\nCrosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist [[Les Paul]], which led to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. ''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.\n\nCrosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R.

He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.\n\nCrosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].\n\nCrosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in [[Cockermouth]] and fishing on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]]. His trip was filmed for ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although all did not go well at first as the [[salmon]] were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of [[sea trout]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trouthotel.co.uk/journal/bing-crosby-came-stay/ | title=When Bing Crosby came to stay |publisher=Trout Hotel Web |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Crosby Brothers-older sons of Bing Crosby 1959.JPG|thumb|Crosby's sons from his first marriage.

When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the [[California Civil Code]], Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as [[community property]] under California law.<ref>''Crosby v.

Accordingly, this was the second season (after season five) in which the top two contestants were never in the bottom, and (after the first season) the second in which both finalists were male.\n\n==Top 14==\n\n===Group 1===\n'''Guest Judge:''' Ross Learmonth\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:60%; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! width=\"05%\"|Order\n! width=\"13%\"|Contestant\n! width=\"32%\"|Song <small>(Original Artist)</small>\n! width=\"10%\"|Result\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| <center>1</center>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| Peter Grobler\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| \"[[Love Is Gone]]\" <small>([[David Guetta]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|'''Eliminated'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| <center>2</center>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| S'posh Petshwa\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| \"[[Doesn't Mean Anything]]\" <small>([[Alicia Keys]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| '''Eliminated'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"| <center>3</center>\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"| Sindi Nene\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"| \"[[Hurt (Christina Aguilera song)|Hurt]]\" <small>([[Christina Aguilera]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"| Bottom 3\n|-\n| <center>4</center>\n| Jess Yallup\n| \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\" <small>([[U2]])</small>\n| Safe\n|-\n| <center>5</center>\n| Pieter West\n| \"Never Gonna Be Alone\" <small>([[Nickelback]])</small>\n| Safe\n|-\n| <center>6</center>\n| Boki Ntsime\n| \"[[Drift Away]]\" <small>(John Henry Kurtz)</small>\n| Safe\n|-\n| <center>7</center>\n| Bongi Mthombeni\n| \"[[The Reason (Hoobastank song)|The Reason]]\" <small>([[Hoobastank]])</small>\n| Safe\n|-\n|-\n|}\n\n===Group 2===\n'''Guest Judge:''' [[Judith Sephuma]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:60%; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! width=\"05%\"|Order\n! width=\"13%\"|Contestant\n! width=\"32%\"|Song <small>(Original Artist)</small>\n! width=\"10%\"|Result\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"| <center>1</center>\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"|Jamie-Lee Sexton\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"|\"[[Mercy (Duffy song)|Mercy]]\" <small>([[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"|             Bottom 3\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| <center>2</center>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|Zintle Mkwela \n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|\"[[Chasing Pavements]]\" <small>([[Adele]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|            '''Eliminated'''\n|-\n| <center>3</center>\n|[[Elvis Blue]]\n|\"[[Heaven (Bryan Adams song)|Heaven]]\" <small>([[Bryan Adams]])</small>\n|            Safe\n|-\n| <center>4</center>\n|[[Gail Nkoane]]\n |\"[[If I Ain't Got You]]\" <small>([[Alicia Keys]])</small>\n|            Safe\n|-\n| <center>5</center>\n|Lloyd Cele\n|\"[[The Time of My Life (David Cook song)|The Time of My Life]]\" <small>([[David Cook (Singer)|David Cook]])</small>\n|            Safe\n|-\n| <center>6</center>\n|Adeline Mocke\n|\"[[When Love Takes Over]]\" <small>([[Kelly Rowland]] & [[David Guetta]])</small>\n|            Safe\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"| <center>7</center>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|Funeka Peppeta\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|\"[[A Moment Like This]]\" <small>([[Kelly Clarkson]])</small>\n|bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"|            '''Eliminated'''         \n|-\n|}\n\n==Finals==\n\n===Finalists===\n(ages stated at time of contest)\n\n{| border=\"8\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n!

It entered the service with 770 enlisted men, and in bravery and efficiency was excelled by few, if any regiments in the service.  It left the state Sept. 10, for [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead, Long Island, N. Y]]., and subsequently for [[Fort Monroe|Fortress Monroe, Va.]], where it formed a part of Gen. [[Thomas W. Sherman|T. W. Sherman's]] expedition to [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal, S. C.]], which sailed on Oct. 29, and landed at [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head]] Nov. 8, 1861.  For several months the men were engaged in throwing up breastworks and building fortifications.  On May 1, 1862, they moved to [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] in the [[Savannah River]], and took a prominent part in the attack on and capture of Fort Pulaski, one of the defenses of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].  From this time until the spring of 1864, the regiment was employed for the most part in doing guard duty at Hilton Head and [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort, S. C]]., and at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville, Fla]].  It suffered much sickness as the result of the exposures of the spring campaign in 1862, and from diseases contracted in a southern climate.  In Nov., 1862, about 300 well drilled and disciplined recruits were sent to the regiment from Maine.  In Nov., 1863, while at Beaufort, S. C., its ranks were again replenished by the addition of nearly 200 drafted men, who proved excellent soldiers.  In March, 1864, 16 officers and 330 enlisted men, who had reenlisted for a term of three years, received a furlough of 35 days and returned to their homes.  In April, 1864, the 8th was transferred to the Department of Virginia, and on May 4, moved to [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]], where it took part in all the active operations of the Army of the James.  Sixty veterans, whose term of service had expired, returned to the state, and were mustered out of service on Sept. 15, 1864.  The regiment was still large enough, however, to retain its organization as many men had reenlisted and it had received 570 recruits.  Until the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, it was engaged in numerous skirmishes and arduous picket and guard duties, and took part in the following important engagements: Drewry's Bluff, losing 96 men, killed, wounded and prisoners; Cold Harbor, where it lost 79 men; the operations before Petersburg, losing 50 men; Chaffin's Farm; Fair Oaks, where it again lost heavily, Spring Hill; capture of Forts Gregg and Baldwin, Rice's Station and Appomattox Court House.  After Lee's surrender, it was at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] until Aug., 1865, at Manchester until the following November, and at Fortress Monroe until Jan. 18, 1866, when the men were mustered out and proceeded to Augusta, Me., where they were paid and finally discharged.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/unionarmyhistory01madi|title=The Union army; a history of military affairs in the loyal states, 1861-65 -- records of the regiments in the Union army -- cyclopedia of battles -- memoirs of commanders and soldiers.
