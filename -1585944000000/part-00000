Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology. <!--In conjunction with this effort, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization while advocating a [[anarcho-primitivism|nature-centered form of anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lDD1AXpeoW4C&pg=PA199 |title=Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs, Social Movements, and Political Parties |isbn=978-0-230-62024-7 |first1=Heather|last1=Gautney |year=2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>--><!-- This sentence doesn't seem to be true -->\n\nIn 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near [[Lincoln, Montana]], where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if the ''Times'' or ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published his essay ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization.\n\nKaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Before his identity was known, the FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (<u>Un</u>iversity and <u>A</u>irline <u>Bom</u>ber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\".

[[Robert Graysmith]], author of the 1986 book ''[[Zodiac (true crime book)|Zodiac]]'', said the similarities are \"fascinating\" but purely coincidental.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/05/14/MN44704.DTL&type=printable |title = Kaczynski, Zodiac Killer \u2013 the Same Guy? |last1 = Fagan |first1 = Kevin |last2 = Wallace |first2 = Bill |date = May 14, 1996 |work = San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate = December 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429204619/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F1996%2F05%2F14%2FMN44704.DTL&type=printable |archivedate = April 29, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe early hunt for the Unabomber portrayed a perpetrator far different from the eventual suspect.

Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology. <!--In conjunction with this effort, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization while advocating a [[anarcho-primitivism|nature-centered form of anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lDD1AXpeoW4C&pg=PA199 |title=Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs, Social Movements, and Political Parties |isbn=978-0-230-62024-7 |first1=Heather|last1=Gautney |year=2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>--><!-- This sentence doesn't seem to be true -->\n\nIn 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near [[Lincoln, Montana]], where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if the ''Times'' or ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published his essay ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization.\n\nKaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Before his identity was known, the FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (<u>Un</u>iversity and <u>A</u>irline <u>Bom</u>ber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\". The FBI and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] pushed for the publication of ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', which led to a tip from Kaczynski's brother [[David Kaczynski|David]], who recognized the writing style.\n\nAfter his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, whereas he did not believe that he was insane. In 1998, a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nTheodore John Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in [[Chicago]], Illinois, to working-class, second-generation [[Polish Americans]], Wanda Theresa ([[n\u00e9e]] Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-14/news/mn-58543_1_ted-kaczynski |title = Adrift in Solitude, Kaczynski Traveled a Lonely Journey |author = Times Staff Writers |website = Los Angeles Times |date = April 14, 1996 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603130746/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-14/news/mn-58543_1_ted-kaczynski |archivedate = June 3, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> a sausage maker.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Unabomber's family photo album |publisher=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-080302ted-photogallery-photogallery.html |accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref> His parents told his younger brother, [[David Kaczynski]], that Ted had been a happy baby until severe [[hives]] forced him into hospital [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] with limited contact with others, after which he \"showed little emotion for months\".<ref name=\"rage\" /> Wanda recalled Ted recoiling from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives.

R. Ross of 1825 Garden Street, [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He spent most of his early life in West Lafayette. About 1932, his family moved to a farm in [[Linden, Indiana|Linden]], [[Montgomery County, Indiana|Montgomery Country]], [[Indiana]]. He attended all four years in Linden High School and graduated in 1936.{{Sfn|Wilson|Winfrey|McDole|2012}} Malcolm Ross received a scholarship to attend [[Purdue University]] to study [[civil engineering]]. While at Purdue, he worked at the campus [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] as a [[Sports commentator|sports announcer]] and changed his major to [[creative writing]], [[communication]], and [[radio]]. However, Malcolm Ross graduated from Purdue in June 1941 with a BS in [[physics]]. After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Martin, and took [[broadcasting]] jobs in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Chicago]], and [[Indianapolis]].{{Sfn|Norberg|2003|p=289}}\n\nIn January 1943, Ross was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the United States Naval Reserve. After he completed two months training at the [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point|Quonset Point Naval Air Station]] in [[Rhode Island]], the Navy sent him to [[graduate school]] for nine months [[training]] in [[physics]] and general [[meteorology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. In June 1944, he completed the training with a professional certificate in meteorology and [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]].\n\nThe Navy initially assigned Ross to the Fleet Weather Center at [[Pearl Harbor]]. Later he served as the [[aerology]] officer aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']] while it was flying missions against [[Tokyo]] and [[Iwo Jima]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]], from 1944 to 1945. Ross received a [[Service star|campaign star]] in his [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal|Pacific Theater Ribbon]] for the first [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] plane strike at Tokyo in February 1945 and for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima invasion]].\n\nAfter World War II ended, Ross was released from the military. He returned to civilian life and opened an [[advertising agency]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], where his wife, Marjorie, had moved during World War II. Marjorie worked in the agency as the [[Office management|office manager]]. The business continued successfully until June 1950, when Ross was recalled to [[active duty]] for the [[Korean War]] as a [[lieutenant]] in the United States Naval Reserve. Initially, Malcolm Ross was stationed as an instructor in radiological defense for the Naval Damage Control Training Center at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. From there he was able to commute home during weekends to spend time with his family and maintain the advertising business. This came to an end when in 1951 the Navy reassigned Ross to work as the [[liaison officer]] for the [[Office of Naval Research]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].\n\nThe Navy's unmanned balloon program, [[Skyhook balloon|Project Skyhook]], was based in Minneapolis, which was also a center of balloon research and development being carried out by the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[General Mills]].<ref name=\"AllHands1953\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah195312.pdf |title=Trip to Outer Space in Navy Skyhook |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 1953 |website=The Official Website of the United States Navy |publisher=Office of Navy Personnel (NAVPERS-O) |pages=10\u201311 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In 1953, Ross was transferred to the air branch of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Balloon Projects Director.

He arranged for balloon launchings at [[Goodfellow Air Force Base]] in 1954 and 1955. He was a member of the scientific group that launched balloons for the ONR at [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, Canada, and photographed the [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1954|1954 eclipse of the sun]] from a Skyhook balloon over Minneapolis.\n\nDuring his tour as ONR's Balloon Projects Officer, Ross initiated the Navy's manned balloon program, [[Project Strato-Lab]], in 1954. The Strato-Lab program utilized the new plastic high-altitude balloons for upper atmosphere research. At this time, Ross became the first active duty military officer qualified and licensed as a [[Balloon Pilot Badge|free balloon pilot]] based solely on plastic balloon experience. Ross went on [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive duty]] in 1955 as a [[Lieutenant Commander]] (USNR). As a physicist in the Air Branch of the ONR, Ross specialized in the physics of the upper atmosphere and participated in Strato-Lab flights both as a civilian and as a naval officer. As the key participant in Project Strato-Lab, he spent more than 100 hours with scientists and other balloonists making observations in the [[stratosphere]]. At the time of the record-setting flight in 1961, Malcolm Ross was a Commander in the Naval Reserve.\n\nIn 1957, Ross received the [[Navy League of the United States|Navy League's]] newly established Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress, and the [[Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award]]. In 1958, jointly with Lieutenant Commander Lewis, he received the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy (Aeronaut)]] for the November 8, 1956, record-breaking flight. In 1962, jointly with [[Victor Prather]], he received the Harmon Trophy again for the record-holding flight in 1961 to {{convert|21.5|mi|km}}. Ross never flew in balloons again after the 1961 flight, although he continued to advocate using balloons as relatively inexpensive platforms for scientific investigations.<ref>Shirley Thomas, ''Men of Space: Profiles of the Leaders in Space Research, Development, and Exploration'' p 136</ref>\n\nMalcolm Ross retired from the US Naval Reserve as a captain on July 1, 1973. After leaving the Office of Naval Research, Malcolm Ross worked in [[space research]] at [[General Motors]]. Later on he became a stock brokerage executive for [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith, Inc.]] and served as assistant vice president and account executive at the [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] branch.\n\nMalcolm Ross died at home in [[Birmingham, Michigan]], and is buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

The flight set a new unofficial record for stratospheric flight of 34 hours 20 minutes. The balloon carried a record load of {{convert|5500|lb|kg}}. The primary purpose of the flight was to test and evaluate the sealed cabin system, which was designed to carry an externally mounted telescope for observation of the atmosphere of Venus.

The balloon touched down near [[Jamestown, North Dakota]]. Due to electrical failures in the ballast control system, they were unable to release additional ballast and impacted somewhat harder than they wished, perhaps 300 to 400 feet (90 to 120 m) per minute. The twin cutoff switches then failed to release the balloon and they ascended again to {{convert|4,000|-|5000|ft|m}}.

R. Ross of 1825 Garden Street, [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He spent most of his early life in West Lafayette. About 1932, his family moved to a farm in [[Linden, Indiana|Linden]], [[Montgomery County, Indiana|Montgomery Country]], [[Indiana]]. He attended all four years in Linden High School and graduated in 1936.{{Sfn|Wilson|Winfrey|McDole|2012}} Malcolm Ross received a scholarship to attend [[Purdue University]] to study [[civil engineering]]. While at Purdue, he worked at the campus [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] as a [[Sports commentator|sports announcer]] and changed his major to [[creative writing]], [[communication]], and [[radio]]. However, Malcolm Ross graduated from Purdue in June 1941 with a BS in [[physics]]. After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Martin, and took [[broadcasting]] jobs in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Chicago]], and [[Indianapolis]].{{Sfn|Norberg|2003|p=289}}\n\nIn January 1943, Ross was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the United States Naval Reserve. After he completed two months training at the [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point|Quonset Point Naval Air Station]] in [[Rhode Island]], the Navy sent him to [[graduate school]] for nine months [[training]] in [[physics]] and general [[meteorology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. In June 1944, he completed the training with a professional certificate in meteorology and [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]].\n\nThe Navy initially assigned Ross to the Fleet Weather Center at [[Pearl Harbor]]. Later he served as the [[aerology]] officer aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']] while it was flying missions against [[Tokyo]] and [[Iwo Jima]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]], from 1944 to 1945. Ross received a [[Service star|campaign star]] in his [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal|Pacific Theater Ribbon]] for the first [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] plane strike at Tokyo in February 1945 and for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima invasion]].\n\nAfter World War II ended, Ross was released from the military. He returned to civilian life and opened an [[advertising agency]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], where his wife, Marjorie, had moved during World War II. Marjorie worked in the agency as the [[Office management|office manager]]. The business continued successfully until June 1950, when Ross was recalled to [[active duty]] for the [[Korean War]] as a [[lieutenant]] in the United States Naval Reserve. Initially, Malcolm Ross was stationed as an instructor in radiological defense for the Naval Damage Control Training Center at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. From there he was able to commute home during weekends to spend time with his family and maintain the advertising business. This came to an end when in 1951 the Navy reassigned Ross to work as the [[liaison officer]] for the [[Office of Naval Research]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].\n\nThe Navy's unmanned balloon program, [[Skyhook balloon|Project Skyhook]], was based in Minneapolis, which was also a center of balloon research and development being carried out by the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[General Mills]].<ref name=\"AllHands1953\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah195312.pdf |title=Trip to Outer Space in Navy Skyhook |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 1953 |website=The Official Website of the United States Navy |publisher=Office of Navy Personnel (NAVPERS-O) |pages=10\u201311 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In 1953, Ross was transferred to the air branch of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Balloon Projects Director.

He arranged for balloon launchings at [[Goodfellow Air Force Base]] in 1954 and 1955. He was a member of the scientific group that launched balloons for the ONR at [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, Canada, and photographed the [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1954|1954 eclipse of the sun]] from a Skyhook balloon over Minneapolis.\n\nDuring his tour as ONR's Balloon Projects Officer, Ross initiated the Navy's manned balloon program, [[Project Strato-Lab]], in 1954. The Strato-Lab program utilized the new plastic high-altitude balloons for upper atmosphere research. At this time, Ross became the first active duty military officer qualified and licensed as a [[Balloon Pilot Badge|free balloon pilot]] based solely on plastic balloon experience. Ross went on [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive duty]] in 1955 as a [[Lieutenant Commander]] (USNR). As a physicist in the Air Branch of the ONR, Ross specialized in the physics of the upper atmosphere and participated in Strato-Lab flights both as a civilian and as a naval officer. As the key participant in Project Strato-Lab, he spent more than 100 hours with scientists and other balloonists making observations in the [[stratosphere]]. At the time of the record-setting flight in 1961, Malcolm Ross was a Commander in the Naval Reserve.\n\nIn 1957, Ross received the [[Navy League of the United States|Navy League's]] newly established Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress, and the [[Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award]]. In 1958, jointly with Lieutenant Commander Lewis, he received the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy (Aeronaut)]] for the November 8, 1956, record-breaking flight. In 1962, jointly with [[Victor Prather]], he received the Harmon Trophy again for the record-holding flight in 1961 to {{convert|21.5|mi|km}}. Ross never flew in balloons again after the 1961 flight, although he continued to advocate using balloons as relatively inexpensive platforms for scientific investigations.<ref>Shirley Thomas, ''Men of Space: Profiles of the Leaders in Space Research, Development, and Exploration'' p 136</ref>\n\nMalcolm Ross retired from the US Naval Reserve as a captain on July 1, 1973. After leaving the Office of Naval Research, Malcolm Ross worked in [[space research]] at [[General Motors]]. Later on he became a stock brokerage executive for [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith, Inc.]] and served as assistant vice president and account executive at the [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] branch.\n\nMalcolm Ross died at home in [[Birmingham, Michigan]], and is buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

The flight was therefore designed to go to {{convert|40000|ft|m}} \u2014 the necessary data might not have been available any lower, but any higher was deemed too risky.

The flight set a new unofficial record for stratospheric flight of 34 hours 20 minutes. The balloon carried a record load of {{convert|5500|lb|kg}}. The primary purpose of the flight was to test and evaluate the sealed cabin system, which was designed to carry an externally mounted telescope for observation of the atmosphere of Venus.

The balloon touched down near [[Jamestown, North Dakota]]. Due to electrical failures in the ballast control system, they were unable to release additional ballast and impacted somewhat harder than they wished, perhaps 300 to 400 feet (90 to 120 m) per minute. The twin cutoff switches then failed to release the balloon and they ascended again to {{convert|4,000|-|5000|ft|m}}.

It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes [[consumerism]], [[corporatism]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K. |title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter'' (Earth Class), or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she angrily blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are suddenly shocked when they see AUTO's first mate GO-4 stowing the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E manages to save the plant from being lost for good, seconds before the pod explodes, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nThey bring the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and finally concludes that they must go back. However, AUTO reveals he was given a final obsolete no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. AUTO and GO-4 stage a [[mutiny]], by electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. Enraged at AUTO's treachery, McCrea struggles with him while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO furiously attemps to close the Holo-Detector, but WALL-E manages to keep it open, ultimatelly getting crashed afterwards. McCrea shuts down AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to forbid anyone return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, \"You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?\"<ref name=notes/><ref name=\"dvd-mother\">DVD. Scene 16. \"Captain on Deck\".

In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives.

Katherine Ellison asserts that \"Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of [[solid waste]] per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.\" [[Landfill]]s were filling up so quickly that predictions were made that the UK could run out of landfill space by the year 2017.<ref name=\"Ellison, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|title=Talking Trash|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=October 2008|volume=6, No. 8|jstor=20440969|pages=456}}</ref>\n\n===Environment, waste and nostalgia===\n{{further|Pollution}}\nIn the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature\u2014that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along.\"<ref name=dreher/>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dove Sent Forth from the Ark.png|thumb|upright|The ''Axiom'' and EVE have been compared to the legend of [[Noah's Ark]] and the dove that Noah sets forth from the Ark.]]\n\nStanton, who is a Christian,<ref name=world>{{cite news|author=Megan Basham|date=June 28, 2008|title=WALL-E world|work=[[World (magazine)|World]]|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14127|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> named EVE after the [[Eve|Biblical figure]] because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of [[Adam]], before God created his wife.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Moring|title=The Little Robot That Could|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 24, 2008|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html|accessdate=November 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731105235/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html |archivedate = July 31, 2008}}</ref> Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the \"false god\" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers.

He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by WALL-E}}\n''WALL-E'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Mixing]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (Sound Editing), and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (Original Screenplay).<ref name=\"Oscars2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |title=The 81st Academy Awards (2009) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 22, 2011|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars 2009: The nominees|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 22, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nomination,<ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael Cieply |author2=Brooks Barnes |title=Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners as Oscar Contenders|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bandyk |first=Matthew |title=Academy Awards Controversy: Wall-E Gets Snubbed For Best Picture Oscar |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar.html |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180938/http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] commented that \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Academy accused of snubbing Dark Knight, Wall-E |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes [[consumerism]], [[corporatism]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K. |title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter'' (Earth Class), or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are interrupted when AUTO's first mate GO-4 arrives and stows the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E saves the plant from being lost for good, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to go back. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. When McCrea countermands this directive, AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. McCrea struggles with AUTO while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO crushes WALL-E in the Holo-Detector, but McCrea deactivates AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to prevent anyone to return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, \"You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?\"<ref name=notes/><ref name=\"dvd-mother\">DVD. Scene 16. \"Captain on Deck\".

Unlike other robots in the film, AUTO is not influenced by WALL-E, but instead follows directive [[A113]], which is to prevent the ''Axiom'' and the humans from returning to Earth because of the toxicity, and it works to prevent anyone from deviating from it.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|<poem>\nBACK ON M-O AND WALLY{{sic}}\n\nM-O just finishes cleaning the floor.\nWally is fascinated.\nImpishly makes another mark.\nM-O compulsively cleans it.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a [[Christmas tree]].

The coach class with living/shopping spaces has \"S\" shapes as people are always looking for \"what's around the corner\". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs.

[[Jim Reardon]], storyboard supervisor for the film, suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included \"It Only Takes a Moment\" and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. ''Hello Dolly!'' composer [[Jerry Herman]] allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story \"genius\".<ref name=EW>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2008/07/14/wall-e-how-he-found-hello-dolly/|title=WALL-E Meets Dolly!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Chriss Willman|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref> Coincidentally, Newman's uncle [[Lionel Newman|Lionel]] worked on ''Hello, Dolly!''<ref name=notes/>\n\nNewman travelled to London to compose the end credits song \"[[Down to Earth (Peter Gabriel song)|Down to Earth]]\" with [[Peter Gabriel]], who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians.

Katherine Ellison asserts that \"Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of [[solid waste]] per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.\" [[Landfill]]s were filling up so quickly that predictions were made that the UK could run out of landfill space by the year 2017.<ref name=\"Ellison, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|title=Talking Trash|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=October 2008|volume=6, No. 8|jstor=20440969|pages=456}}</ref>\n\n===Environment, waste and nostalgia===\n{{further|Pollution}}\nIn the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature\u2014that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along.\"<ref name=dreher/>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dove Sent Forth from the Ark.png|thumb|upright|The ''Axiom'' and EVE have been compared to the legend of [[Noah's Ark]] and the dove that Noah sets forth from the Ark.]]\n\nStanton, who is a Christian,<ref name=world>{{cite news|author=Megan Basham|date=June 28, 2008|title=WALL-E world|work=[[World (magazine)|World]]|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14127|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> named EVE after the [[Eve|Biblical figure]] because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of [[Adam]], before God created his wife.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Moring|title=The Little Robot That Could|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 24, 2008|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html|accessdate=November 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731105235/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html |archivedate = July 31, 2008}}</ref> Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the \"false god\" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers. Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints, where Adam is ''cursed'' to labor, in that ''WALL-E'' argues hard work is what makes humans human. Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants \"B is for Buy n Large, your very best friend\", which he compared to modern corporations such as [[McDonald's]] creating [[brand loyalty]] in children.<ref name=\"dreher\">{{cite web | url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2008/07/walle-aristotelian-crunchy-con.html | title=\"Wall-E\": Aristotelian, crunchy con | work=[[Beliefnet]] | date=July 5, 2008 | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | author=Rod Dreher | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708131939/http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2008/07/walle-aristotelian-crunchy-con.html | archivedate=July 8, 2008 | url-status=unfit}}</ref> Megan Basham of ''[[World (magazine)|World]]'' magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure, whereas WALL-E in his [[stewardship]] learns to truly appreciate God's creation.<ref name=world/>\n\nDuring writing, a Pixar employee noted to [[Jim Reardon]] that EVE was reminiscent of the [[dove]] with the [[olive branch]] from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage.<ref>Hauser, p. 83.</ref> WALL-E himself has been compared to [[Prometheus]],<ref name=comingsoon/> [[Sisyphus]],<ref name=dreher/> and [[Butades]]: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, [[Hrag Vartanian]] compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts. \"The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war.

He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by WALL-E}}\n''WALL-E'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Mixing]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (Sound Editing), and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (Original Screenplay).<ref name=\"Oscars2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |title=The 81st Academy Awards (2009) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 22, 2011|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars 2009: The nominees|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 22, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nomination,<ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael Cieply |author2=Brooks Barnes |title=Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners as Oscar Contenders|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bandyk |first=Matthew |title=Academy Awards Controversy: Wall-E Gets Snubbed For Best Picture Oscar |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar.html |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180938/http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] commented that \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Academy accused of snubbing Dark Knight, Wall-E |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

A majority of these game shows often run for 30 minutes in each episode. They often derive their formats from game shows produced in the [[United States]], most of them having been run on [[Canada|Canadian]] networks such as [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[Citytv]].\n\nAlthough [[United States|American]] game and quiz shows are popular in Canada, Canadian residents are not eligible to be contestants on some of them, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel Of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' being three notable exceptions. Unlike in the US, game show winnings in Canada are not subject to [[income tax]] (actually, residents of most countries aside from the US are not subject to income tax on game show winnings).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nThere are very few Canadian adaptations of American, British, and Dutch-originated quiz shows in the English language. Most, like versions of ''The Price Is Right'', ''Wheel of Fortune'', ''Jeopardy!'', and ''Family Feud'', are in French. Some English-language versions of these shows include ''Supermarket Sweep'', ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', ''Deal or No Deal'', ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'', and ''Cash Cab''. There are also French-language versions of ''Deal or No Deal'', ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'', and ''Cash Cab''.\n\n*''[[5-4-3-2-Run]]''\n*''[[Acting Crazy]]''\n*''[[Are You Smarter Than a Canadian 5th Grader?]]''\n*''[[Le Banquier]]''\n*''[[Brain Battle]]''\n*''[[Bumper Stumpers]]''\n*''[[Cash Cab (British game show)|Cash Cab]]''\n*''[[La Cible|Le Cercle]]''\n*''[[Clips (game show)|Clips]]''\n*''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]''\n*''[[Deal or No Deal Canada]]''\n*''[[Design to Win]]''\n*''[[Food for Thought (game show)|Food For Thought]]''\n*''[[Front Page Challenge]]''\n*''[[Game On (Canadian game show)|Game On]]''\n*''[[La Guerre des clans]]''\n*''[[Guess What (Canadian TV series)|Guess What]]''\n*''[[Gutterball Alley]]''\n*''[[Headline Hunters (game show)|Headline Hunters]]''\n*''[[Inside the Box]]''\n*''[[It's Your Move (game show)|It's Your Move]]''\n*''[[Jeux D'Enfants (game show)|Jeux D'Enfants]]''\n*''[[Just Like Mom]]''\n*''[[Kidstreet]]''\n*''[[Lingo (U.S. game show)|Lingo]]''\n*''[[Love Handles (game show)|Love Handles]]''\n*''[[Love Me, Love Me Not (game show)|Love Me, Love Me Not]]''\n*''[[The Joke's on Us]]''\n*''[[The Last Word (game show)|The Last Word]]''\n*''[[The Mad Dash]]''\n*''[[The Moneymakers]]''\n*''[[Les Mordus]]''\n*''[[Mr & Mrs (Canadian TV series)|Mr. and Mrs.]]''\n*''[[Liar's Club|The New Liar's Club]]''\n*''[[The Next Line]]''\n*''[[Paquet Voleur]]''\n*''[[Party Game (game show)|Party Game]]''\n*''[[Pitfall (game show)|Pitfall]]''\n*''[[Reach for the Top]]''\n*''[[International versions of Wheel of Fortune|La Roue Chanceuse]]''\n*''[[SmartAsk]]''\n*''[[Supermarket Sweep]]''\n*''[[Talk About (game show)|Talk About]]''\n*''[[Test Pattern (game show)|Test Pattern]]''\n*''[[This Is the Law]]''\n*''[[TimeChase]]''\n*''[[Tip of My Tongue (Canadian game show)|Tip of My Tongue]]''\n*''[[Uh Oh!

A majority of these game shows often run for 30 minutes in each episode. They often derive their formats from game shows produced in the [[United States]], most of them having been run on [[Canada|Canadian]] networks such as [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[Citytv]].\n\nAlthough [[United States|American]] game and quiz shows are popular in Canada, Canadian residents are not eligible to be contestants on some of them, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel Of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' being three notable exceptions. Unlike in the US, game show winnings in Canada are not subject to [[income tax]] (actually, residents of most countries aside from the US are not subject to income tax on game show winnings).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nThere are very few Canadian adaptations of American, British, and Dutch-originated quiz shows in the English language. Most, like versions of ''The Price Is Right'', ''Wheel of Fortune'', ''Jeopardy!'', and ''Family Feud'', are in French. Some English-language versions of these shows include ''Supermarket Sweep'', ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', ''Deal or No Deal'', ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'', and ''Cash Cab''.
