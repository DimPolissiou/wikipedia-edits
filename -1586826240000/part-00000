Jackie Leyland, framed her client Daphne Rivas for theft; after being pressured by the police chief not to charge Leyland, Judge Carmichael instead forces both the defense and the prosecution to submit new evidence that contradicts the officer's testimony, allowing Rivas to go free; she then warns Leyland never to lie in her courtroom again. DDA Mark Callan is set to try a man accused of robbery who insists on representing himself and uses the opportunity to cross-examine Mark, revealing that his father Victor Callan is a known grifter and criminal. Through a clever trick, however, Mark convinces the jury that his opponent is guilty. Emily meets Luke, a bailiff training to be a lawyer, but having already been through an abusive relationship, she decides she's not ready for a new one with him. Lola tells Daphne that she knows her mother was the real culprit and made her take the fall by threatening to abandon her and her unborn baby; she encourages her to leave and start her own life. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Long Day's Journey into ICE\n |DirectedBy      = Michael M.

Mark discovers that the father of a young woman he's prosecuting paid a witness to lie on the stand, which puts him into conflict with defense attorney Amy Quinn. Realizing this, Lola points out that Mark always had \u201ca thing\u201d for Amy, annoying him. Aware of the pressure of having to protect a criminally inclined parent, he persuades the girl to testify against her father, getting him sentenced to two years with the help of his superior, DA Thomas Choi. Emily prepares to enter a guilty plea on her client's behalf that would result in a four-year sentence and strip him of his right to asylum, but Lola refuses to accept it. Instead, she finds a loophole that allows the defendant to instead be charged with a misdemeanor, ensuring that he will only have to serve three months and protecting him from deportation.

Against Choi's wishes, Mark chooses to file charges in a racially-charged incident for which there is no clear proof and the victim refuses to testify.

The trip initially goes well, but when police report an active shooter in the area, the court is forced to take shelter. This causes Lola to fear that her decision will lead to a biased verdict, and she insists on personally meeting with each of the jurors individually before deciding whom to strike. Mark is prosecuting a powerful [[heroin]] kingpin; his entire case is based on video footage provided by Det. Leyland. Warned by Lola, Mark takes a closer look at Leyland's evidence and quickly realizes that the warrant she used to obtain it was based on a CI's false testimony. Despite his misgivings about challenging the police, he informs Choi, who calls in the police chief and gets him to have Leyland investigated. Mark is forced to dismiss the charges, but Choi congratulates him, noting that the business of prosecutors is to get justice, not convictions. In spite of Lola's fears, the jury finds Dylan not guilty.

Lola is stunned to learn that her latest defendant will be charged hefty court fees, so she works out a plan for him to serve a few hours in jail instead. Emily's client, a [[Catholic]] nun ([[Emma Dumont]]), falsely confesses to stealing from her church; Emily determines that she did so in order to protect her mentor, the church's accountant, who stole the money in a dispute over how it was to be spent. Emily arranges for the stolen funds to be returned, and Lola sentences her client to community service. Mark is prosecuting a woman who is a serial dine-and-dasher. Amy Quinn is her lawyer and beats Mark in court by using dirty tactics. Amy surprises him afterwards by informing her guilty client that she will not be representing her in the future. They agree to have dinner together when possible. Luke helps Emily remove her engagement ring so she can return it to her former mother-in-law.

Emily tries to get Mark to sign off on a more favorable deal to her client, who belongs to a family of criminals; after a difficult conversation about how they both know what it's like to have family issues, Mark agrees. After being forced to stay with Sherri for the night when her home address is posted online, Lola has had enough and orders a formal complaint written up against Pryce, threatening him with potential [[disbarment]] to keep him in line. Choi then delivers a powerful cross-examination of the defendant, forcing her to incriminate herself and sealing her fate. Lola is disgusted to find that Pryce doesn't even care that he lost, only that he was outmaneuvered.

Lola discovers her social activist mother, Roxy, is testifying on behalf of Jax, a [[non binary]] homeless youth who uses they/them pronouns and is accused of [[arson]]. Mark is prosecuting the case and hammers Roxy with questions implying Jax's guilt, leading to Roxy being found in contempt of court for refusing to answer. Only when Lola tells Roxy to have faith in the system does she agree to finish her testimony. Emily tells Luke that while she kissed him, she does not want to pursue their relationship any further for now. Sherri and Sara compete with each other for the chance to be named the building's new earthquake safety warden. Lola refuses to sign off on a warrant over [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] concerns, but Benner overrules her and signs it; Lola angrily confronts her but recognizes that she doesn't have the same experience and foresight as her mentor. Jax is found guilty, but only on a minor charge with no prison time. Encouraged by Roxy, Mark has a drink with his father. Luke tells Emily that she needs to decide what she wants.

After beating a judge in a game of [[pai gow]], Mark gets the witness released and brings him back in time to testify. Lola's latest defendant, Felix Flores, is accused of murdering his wife Linda despite no body having been found. Among the witnesses is his eleven-year old daughter Maricela, who's unwillingness to put her father in prison results in Emily and Lola crossing swords as the latter goes above and beyond to avoid breaking up their family. Following state guidelines, Lola modifies her courtroom to make Maricela comfortable so she can testify. Emily spots an inconsistency in the testimony of another witness, Linda's best friend, and has the police look into it. A search of the witness' house reveals the truth: Linda, a recovering addict, had an overdose and was buried by her friend in secret to hide her own habit. Felix and Maricela are reunited, and Emily goes to apologize to Lola, who is annoyed by her lack of respect but concurs she would have done the same as a lawyer. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = How to Succeed in Law Without Really Re-trying\n |DirectedBy      = [[Cheryl Dunye]]\n |WrittenBy       = Gregory Nelson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|25}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22109\n |Viewers         = 5.12<ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-25-2019/|title='9-1-1' adjusts up, 'The Voice' and 'Bluff City Law' adjusts down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 26, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola's old nemesis, Felice Bell ([[Ever Carradine]]), announces she is appealing one of Lola's biggest cases while she was at the district attorney's office: putting an [[Alt-right|alt-right]] sympathizer in jail for a bombing that killed a young woman. As Mark's case for the appeal begins to fall apart due to gaps in the evidence, and Lola confronts Felice about intimidating her, she begins to wonder if she put an innocent man behind bars.

Emily forces him and his mother to reveal the truth: the witness blackmailed Jeremy by threatening to publicize Valerie's [[bipolar disorder]]. This information enables Lola to have the witness arrested and give Jeremy a lighter sentence.

Lola must decide whether to exclude the recordings, potentially antagonizing the cops and lawyers she works with, or admit them and condemn Emily's client in a case where it's uncertain if he is truly guilty. Amy informs Mark that she has the means to clear Vic's name, but having already lost faith in his father, Mark feels that he should be convicted anyway. Lola's husband, Robin, tells her he's been offered a promotion that will keep him in D.C. for the foreseeable future. Mark reconciles with Vic, deciding that while he still hates him for his negligence as a parent, that doesn't change the fact that he's innocent. Lola admits the recordings, but successfully pressures the prosecution to offer Emily a deal giving her client immunity if he testifies against his gang.

Sara starts a betting pool for which clerkship offer Luke will accept. Mark works with an elderly widow, Bernie, to prepare for the trial of the man who mugged her. The two befriend each other, and Bernie urges Mark to make peace with Vic, who will soon be freed because of Amy's work.

Mark and Luke are forced to shelter in place with Judge Laski after Luke violates court rules by speaking out of turn, earning a reprimand. Mark correctly deduces that Luke's outburst is tied to his feeling that he and Emily are drifting apart; Laski advises Luke to either start listening to Emily or end things. Lola convinces Bowles to release the jury members, but he then threatens to shoot Choi; Emily intervenes to save him by using Choi's family to guilt Bowles into sparing him. Judge Benner is locked in her office with Jean Frost, an old acquaintance who had previously spoken with Lola about her case. Frost tears into Benner, accusing her of being heartless, to which Benner confesses that she leaked documents her firm tried to hide, an offense that could get her disbarred.

He ignores Choi's orders to turn the case over to the Conviction Review Unit and has the man arrested, and Choi angrily suspends him. Emily finds herself hastily assigned to several new cases, including that of a veteran who she deduces is suffering from untreated [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Her motion to have the charges dropped is denied by Lola, who asks instead for a deal in which her client will receive treatment while serving a one-year sentence. The experience brings her and Luke (sitting second chair in the trial) closer together than they've been in weeks.

Luke questions whether Emily truly loves him, and she explains that her failed marriage has warped her understanding of what love is. Luke tells her they'll find a way to work past that.

Jackie Leyland, framed her client Daphne Rivas for theft; after being pressured by the police chief not to charge Leyland, Judge Carmichael instead forces both the defense and the prosecution to submit new evidence that contradicts the officer's testimony, allowing Rivas to go free; she then warns Leyland never to lie in her courtroom again. DDA Mark Callan is set to try a man accused of robbery who insists on representing himself and uses the opportunity to cross-examine Mark, revealing that his father Victor Callan is a known grifter and criminal. Through a clever trick, however, Mark convinces the jury that his opponent is guilty. Emily meets Luke, a bailiff training to be a lawyer, but having already been through an abusive relationship, she decides she's not ready for a new one with him. Lola tells Daphne that she knows her mother was the real culprit and made her take the fall by threatening to abandon her and her unborn baby; she encourages her to leave and start her own life. \n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Long Day's Journey into ICE\n |DirectedBy      = Michael M.

Mark discovers that the father of a young woman he's prosecuting paid a witness to lie on the stand, which puts him into conflict with defense attorney Amy Quinn. Realizing this, Lola points out that Mark always had \u201ca thing\u201d for Amy, annoying him. Aware of the pressure of having to protect a criminally inclined parent, he persuades the girl to testify against her father, getting him sentenced to two years with the help of his superior, DA Thomas Choi. Emily prepares to enter a guilty plea on her client's behalf that would result in a four-year sentence and strip him of his right to asylum, but Lola refuses to accept it. Instead, she finds a loophole that allows the defendant to instead be charged with a misdemeanor, ensuring that he will only have to serve three months and protecting him from deportation. Later that night, Mark gives Lola a housewarming gift: a framed photo of her childhood hero, [[Nyota Uhura]].\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Sweet Bird of Truth\n |DirectedBy      = [[Anthony Hemingway]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Sunil Nayar]] & Iturri Sosa\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|7}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22103\n |Viewers         = 5.27<ref name=\"1.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-october-7-2019/|title='9-1-1' adjusts up, 'Bluff City Law' adjusts down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2019|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = An unusual case is presented to Lola: a gamer, Janny Cartwright, accusing her friend of hacking into the popular online game ''Skyrise'' and \"murdering\" her avatar Errk. To facilitate her testimony, Lola allows Cartwright to testify while in character as Errk, leading to the prosecution threatening to file a complaint against her for incompetence. Recognizing that the case is civil, not criminal, in nature, Lola persuades both sides to agree to a settlement, in which no jail time will be served. Against Choi's wishes, Mark chooses to file charges in a racially-charged incident for which there is no clear proof and the victim refuses to testify. Faced with near-certain defeat, he wins only by submitting evidence proving that the man intended to commit violence.

The trip initially goes well, but when police report an active shooter in the area, the court is forced to take shelter. This causes Lola to fear that her decision will lead to a biased verdict, and she insists on personally meeting with each of the jurors individually before deciding whom to strike. Mark is prosecuting a powerful [[heroin]] kingpin; his entire case is based on video footage provided by Det. Leyland. Warned by Lola, Mark takes a closer look at Leyland's evidence and quickly realizes that the warrant she used to obtain it was based on a CI's false testimony. Despite his misgivings about challenging the police, he informs Choi, who calls in the police chief and gets him to have Leyland investigated. Mark is forced to dismiss the charges, but Choi congratulates him, noting that the business of prosecutors is to get justice, not convictions.

Lola is stunned to learn that her latest defendant will be charged hefty court fees, so she works out a plan for him to serve a few hours in jail instead. Emily's client, a [[Catholic]] nun ([[Emma Dumont]]), falsely confesses to stealing from her church; Emily determines that she did so in order to protect her mentor, the church's accountant, who stole the money in a dispute over how it was to be spent. Emily arranges for the stolen funds to be returned, and Lola sentences her client to community service. Mark is prosecuting a woman who is a serial dine-and-dasher. Amy Quinn is her lawyer and beats Mark in court by using dirty tactics. Amy surprises him afterwards by informing her guilty client that she will not be representing her in the future.

Emily tries to get Mark to sign off on a more favorable deal to her client, who belongs to a family of criminals; after a difficult conversation about how they both know what it's like to have family issues, Mark agrees. After being forced to stay with Sherri for the night when her home address is posted online, Lola has had enough and orders a formal complaint written up against Pryce, threatening him with potential [[disbarment]] to keep him in line. Choi then delivers a powerful cross-examination of the defendant, forcing her to incriminate herself and sealing her fate.

Lola's latest defendant, Felix Flores, is accused of murdering his wife Linda despite no body having been found. Among the witnesses is his eleven-year old daughter Maricela, who's unwillingness to put her father in prison results in Emily and Lola crossing swords as the latter goes above and beyond to avoid breaking up their family. Following state guidelines, Lola modifies her courtroom to make Maricela comfortable so she can testify. Emily spots an inconsistency in the testimony of another witness, Linda's best friend, and has the police look into it. A search of the witness' house reveals the truth: Linda, a recovering addict, had an overdose and was buried by her friend in secret to hide her own habit.

Luke gifts Emily a fish, and even though it brings up bad memories of her marriage, she accepts it. After the prelim, Amy meets Mark in his office and kisses him. He asks her if she would like to date and she says yes, so they start dating for real.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |Title           = My Fair Lockdown\n |DirectedBy      = David Harp\n |WrittenBy       = Conway Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|17}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22116\n |Viewers         = 5.37<ref name=\"1.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-17-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.17.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 19, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The courthouse goes into lockdown when a defendant, Ephraim Bowles, steals a bailiff's gun and takes Lola, Choi, Emily, and the jury hostage. Mark and Luke are forced to shelter in place with Judge Laski after Luke violates court rules by speaking out of turn, earning a reprimand. Mark correctly deduces that Luke's outburst is tied to his feeling that he and Emily are drifting apart; Laski advises Luke to either start listening to Emily or end things. Lola convinces Bowles to release the jury members, but he then threatens to shoot Choi; Emily intervenes to save him by using Choi's family to guilt Bowles into sparing him. Judge Benner is locked in her office with Jean Frost, an old acquaintance who had previously spoken with Lola about her case. Frost tears into Benner, accusing her of being heartless, to which Benner confesses that she leaked documents her firm tried to hide, an offense that could get her disbarred. Ephraim contemplates suicide before his estranged daughter sends a video message urging him to surrender, which he does. Everyone is reunited with their loved ones, and Lola catches Benner and Frost embracing each other.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 17\n |Title           = I Love You, You're Perfect, I Think\n |DirectedBy      = Paul McCrane\n |WrittenBy       = Gregory Nelson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|9}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22117\n |Viewers         = 4.62<ref name=\"1.17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-9-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.9.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola presents her findings to Judge Benner, which leads to an argument as Benner insists that an ethical violation is nothing compared to all the good work she intends to do as Attorney General. Mark makes an unexpected discovery: a burglary suspect may be responsible for a murder he prosecuted eight years ago in which an innocent man was convicted. He ignores Choi's orders to turn the case over to the Conviction Review Unit and has the man arrested, and Choi angrily suspends him. Emily finds herself hastily assigned to several new cases, including that of a veteran who she deduces is suffering from untreated [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Her motion to have the charges dropped is denied by Lola, who asks instead for a deal in which her client will receive treatment while serving a one-year sentence. The experience brings her and Luke (sitting second chair in the trial) closer together than they've been in weeks. Sara forces Judge Campbell to acknowledge a mistake he made and wins his respect for standing up for herself. Judge Benner tells Lola she was wrong for challenging her, and will drop out of the race immediately.\n |LineColor       = A42C17\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 18\n |Title           = The Tale of Three Arraignments\n |DirectedBy      = Claudia Yarmy\n |WrittenBy       = Denitria Harris-Lawrence\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.22118\n |Viewers         = 5.80<ref name=\"1.18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lola is selected by Judge Benner to handle [[arraignment]]s for the day, while Mark is penalized for his conduct with an assignment in the Case Review Unit. Lola runs into her old classmate Rachel, who is opening her own firm and wants to take Lola and Mark on as partners. Emily determines that her client Pamela, a prostitute, is being made to take the fall for her pimp. She and DDA Palmer have him arrested and cut a deal with his lawyer, Rachel, to get him to flip on his boss. Emily also gets Pamela help starting a new life. Robin suddenly returns home with news that he may be getting a job in L.A., to his wife's surprise. Mark contemplates the benefits of joining a private firm, but decides that he can put the decision off while he resumes his normal job. Amy, however, accepts Rachel's offer. Luke questions whether Emily truly loves him, and she explains that her failed marriage has warped her understanding of what love is. Luke tells her they'll find a way to work past that.

He was replaced by striker [[Trevor Francis]], who juggled his playing responsibilities with his management role. Under Francis, Wednesday enjoyed a fabulous season, finishing third, behind [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and ahead of bigger clubs like [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; this gave Wednesday qualification to the [[UEFA Cup]].\n\nDespite their overall good form, Wednesday still found themselves on the receiving ends of the season's heaviest home (6-1 to Leeds) and away (7-1 to Arsenal) defeats. Wednesday also lost both of that season's [[Steel City derby|derbies]] against arch-rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], losing 1-3 at home and 2-0 at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\n==Final league

[[Football League First Division]], following promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] the previous season.\n\n==Season summary==\nHaving guided Sheffield Wednesday to promotion to the First Division and League Cup glory the previous season, [[Ron Atkinson]] left Wednesday for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (in somewhat controversial circumstances, having claimed that he was staying on at Wednesday before departing a week later). He was replaced by striker [[Trevor Francis]], who juggled his playing responsibilities with his management role. Under Francis, Wednesday enjoyed a fabulous season, finishing third, behind [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and ahead of bigger clubs like [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; this gave Wednesday qualification to the [[UEFA Cup]].\n\nDespite their overall good form, Wednesday still found themselves on the receiving ends of the season's heaviest home (6-1 to Leeds) and away (7-1 to Arsenal) defeats. Wednesday also lost both of that season's [[Steel City derby|derbies]] against arch-rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], losing 1-3 at home and 2-0 at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\n==Final league
