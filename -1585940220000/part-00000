Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nNelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims \u201ctoday is a good day to die\u201d. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates\u2014Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Randy Steckle, and Rachel Manus\u2014to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While \"dead\", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.\n\nJoe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. David is third to flatline, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically beat up by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by his home videos of his sexual dalliances with other women. David finds Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her.\n\nRachel decides to flatline next on Halloween. David tries to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already \"dead\" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies for good after the power goes out, and the men are unable to shock her with the [[defibrillator]] paddles. Luckily, she survives, but she, too, is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.\n\nThe three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fianc\u00e9e, Anne, comes to his apartment, and she breaks up with him after she discovers his videos. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him.\n\nDavid goes to visit Winnie Hicks, now grown up, and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. Then, David finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is attempting for a third time to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town.\n\nRachel seeks comfort in the arms of David, and the two spend the night together. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. Nelson storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.\n\nDavid leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom, and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter, and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to heroin. Then, Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his stupid plan.\n\nThe three men race to Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, \"It wasn't such a good day to die.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Nelson Wright\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Rachel Manus\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as David Labraccio\n* [[William Baldwin]] as Joe Hurley\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Randy Steckle\n* [[Kimberly Scott]] as Winnie Hicks\n* Joshua Rudoy as Billy Mahoney\n* [[Benjamin Mouton]] as Mr. Manus\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Anne Coldren\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Edna\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Housewife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released ''Flatliners'' theatrically  on August 10, 1990.

It was popularised by [[Reynolds Metals]], the leading manufacturer in North America. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] it is, informally, widely called tin foil, for historical reasons (similar to how [[steel can]]s are often still called \"[[tin can]]s\"). [[Metallised film]]s are sometimes mistaken for aluminium foil, but are actually polymer films [[thin-film deposition|coated]] with a thin layer of aluminium.

Aluminium foil acts as a total barrier to light and oxygen (which cause fats to oxidise or become rancid), odours and flavours, moistness, and germs, and so it is used broadly in food and pharmaceutical packaging, including long-life packs ([[aseptic processing|aseptic packaging]]) for drinks and dairy goods, which allows storing without refrigeration. Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack [[Take-out|takeaway]] meals, ready snacks and long life [[pet]] foods.\n\nAluminium foil is widely sold into the [[consumer]] market, often in rolls of {{convert|500|mm|abbr=on}} width and several metres in length.<ref>[http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 Examples of products]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218165509/http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 |date=2008-12-18 }}</ref> It is used for wrapping food in order to preserve it, for example, when storing leftover food in a [[refrigerator]] (where it serves the additional purpose of preventing odour exchange), when taking [[sandwich]]es on a journey, when baking, or when selling some kinds of [[take-away]] or [[fast food]]. [[Tex-Mex]] restaurants in the [[United States]], for example, typically provide take-away [[burrito]]s wrapped in aluminium foil.\n\n=== Insulation ===\nAluminium foil is widely used for radiation shield (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers ([[heat conduction]]) and cable liners (barrier and [[electrical conductivity]]). Aluminium foil's heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in [[hookah]] smoking: a sheet of perforated aluminium foil is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into direct contact with the burning coal.\n\n=== Electromagnetic shielding ===\nThe [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding effectiveness]] of aluminium foil depends upon the type of incident field (electric, magnetic, or plane wave), the thickness of the foil, and the frequency (which determines the [[skin depth]]). Shielding effectiveness is usually broken down into a reflection loss (the energy bounces off the shield rather than penetrates it) and an absorption loss (the energy is dissipated within the shield).\n\nAlthough aluminium is non-magnetic, it is a good conductor, so even a thin sheet reflects almost all of an incident electric wave. At frequencies more than 100&nbsp;MHz, the ''transmitted'' electric field is attenuated by more than 80 [[decibel]]s (dB) (less than 10<sup>\u22128</sup> = 0.00000001 of the power gets through) <ref>{{Citation |last=Ott |first=Henry |title=Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems |year=1976 |publisher=Wiley Interscience |isbn=0-471-65726-3 |doi= }}. {{Harvtxt|Ott|1976|loc=figure 6-13}} graphs reflection loss for copper, and shows electric field and plane wave losses at greater than 90&nbsp;dB.</ref> -- however actual energy absorption is minimal:  the remaining high-frequency rf energy is almost perfectly reflected from uniform flat aluminium surface, and thus, reflected signal may continue to propagate internally, and if holes or passages of suitable geometry exist in the shield, signal propagation may continue out through those, the aluminium being good material for implementation of a microwave-frequency [[waveguide]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThin sheets of aluminium are not very effective at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields.  The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth. A field travelling through one skin depth will lose about 63 per cent of its energy (it is attenuated to 1/e = 1/2.718... of its original energy).  Thin shields also have internal reflections that reduce the shielding effectiveness.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ott|1976|pp=155&ndash;156}}</ref>  For effective shielding from a magnetic field, the shield should be several skin depths thick.  Aluminium foil is about {{convert|1|mil|um}}; a thickness of {{convert|10|mil|um}} (ten times thicker) offers less than 1&nbsp;dB of shielding at 1&nbsp;kHz, about 8&nbsp;dB at 10&nbsp;kHz, and about 25&nbsp;dB at 100&nbsp;kHz.  At these frequencies a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic material]] such as [[mild steel]] is much more effective, due to different and complementary [[Permeability_(electromagnetism)|electromagnetic permeability]] properties, and common practical shielding implementations utilise both an inner high-frequency reflective material such as aluminium, preferably bonded (via [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] or [[electroplating]], done to avoid capacitance between separated layers), to a more substantial structural ferromagnetic shell, usually mild steel (in specialized applications, more expensive, less structurally useful and less workable materials may be preferred.)  Despite the relative low mass density of aluminium, this design is usually both lighter and more effective than an equivalently absorptive design utilizing aluminium alone (although with poorer heat dissipative properties, typically accommodated by improved ventilation, which itself needs careful consideration in order to preserve the desired shielding effectiveness).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Cooking ===\nAluminium foil is also used for [[barbecue|barbecuing]] delicate foods,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&pg=PA207&dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&f=false|title=Kitchen on Fire!: Mastering the Art of Cooking in 12 Weeks (or Less)|last=Said|first=Olivier|last2=MikeC|first2=Chef|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780738214535|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022234134/https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&pg=PA207&dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&f=false|archivedate=2017-10-22}}</ref> such as mushrooms and vegetables. Using this method, sometimes called a '''hobo pack''', food is wrapped in foil, then placed on the grill, preventing loss of moisture that may result in a less appealing texture.\n\nAs is the case with all metallic items, aluminium foil reacts to being placed in a [[microwave oven]]. This is because of the [[electromagnetic field]]s of the microwaves inducing electric currents in the foil and high [[voltage|potentials]] at the sharp points of the foil sheet; if the potential is sufficiently high, it will cause [[electric arc]]ing to areas with lower potential, even to the air surrounding the sheet.  Modern microwave ovens have been designed to prevent damage to the [[cavity magnetron]] tube from microwave energy reflection, and aluminium packages designed for microwave heating are available.<ref>Huss, G. (1997) Microwaveable Packaging and Dual-Ovenable Materials in The Wiley Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology, 2nd ed., edited by Brody, A. and Marsch, K. New York, John Wiley and Sons</ref>\n\n=== Art and decoration ===\nHeavier foils made of aluminium are used for art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright metallic colours. Metallic aluminium, normally silvery in colour, can be made to take on other colours through [[anodization|anodisation]]. Anodising creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright metallic colours. These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging.\n\n=== Geochemical sampling ===\nFoil is used by organic/petroleum geochemists for protecting rock samples taken from the fields and in the labs where the sample is subject to [[biomarker]] analysis. While plastic or cloth bags are normally used for a geological sampling exercise, cloth bags are permeable and may allow organic solvents or oils (such as oils imparted from the skin) to taint the sample, and traces of the plastics from plastic bags may also taint the sample. Foil provides a seal to the ingress of organic solvents and does not taint the sample. Foil is also used extensively in geochemical laboratories to provide a barrier for the geochemist, and for sample storage.\n\n=== Ribbon microphones ===\nThe material used in many [[ribbon microphone]]s is aluminium leaf, or \"[[Metal leaf|imitation silver leaf]]\", as it is sometimes called. This is pure aluminium and is around 0.6 to 2.0 micrometres thick. It is virtually the same material that the BBC used on [[Coles 4038|Coles ribbon]]s, with the exception that they also hand beat the leaf even thinner. They did this by sandwiching the ribbon between toilet paper and beating with a [[ball-peen hammer]]. This \"cold forges\" the leaf. The aluminium leaf was then annealed for an hour in an oven to restore flexibility. Corrugations must also be imparted into the ribbon: Coles used 25 per inch (1&nbsp;mm cycle). RCA 44BX has 19 corrugations per inch (0.7&nbsp;mm cycle) and is around {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} long; RCA 77 has 13 corrugations per inch (0.5&nbsp;mm cycle). RCA ribbon material is around 1 to 1.5 micrometres (0.00005&nbsp;inch) thick. The new Nady ribbon plus AEA both state that they use 2 micrometre aluminium ribbon in their microphones.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Environmental issues ==\n{{See also|Aluminium recycling}}\n\nSome aluminium foil products can be [[recycling|recycled]] at around 5% of the original [[energy]] cost,<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]]|url=http://asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|title=Action Plan, page 5, table 2: 4.2 vs. 0.19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406032451/http://www.asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|archivedate=2009-04-06|access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> although many aluminium laminates are not recycled due to difficulties in separating the components and low yield of aluminium metal.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aluminium}}\n* [[Tin foil hat]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Aluminium foil}}\n* [http://www.alufoil.org European Aluminium Foil Association]\n* [http://www.aluminum.org Aluminium Association (USA)]\n* [http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Aluminum-Foil.html Aluminium Foil] from ''How Products Are Made,'' vol. 1, Thomson Gale (2005).\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4OTj9yNOak How It's Made: Aluminium Foil] - HowItsMadeEpisodes channel on YouTube.\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Chemistry}}\n\n[[Category:Cooking utensils]]\n[[Category:Aluminium]]\n[[Category:Packaging materials]]\n[[Category:Metalworking]]\n[[Category:Swiss inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|aluminium foil|other types of foil|Foil (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2016}}\n<!-- Please DO NOT unnecessarily change Aluminium to Aluminum.

Foil may have a non-stick coating on only one side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/media/10246730/reynolds_wrap_faq.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2014-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021084635/http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/media/10246730/reynolds_wrap_faq.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-21 }}</ref> The [[reflectivity]] of bright aluminium foil is 88% while dull embossed foil is about 80%.<ref name=\"Hanlon\"/>\n\n==Uses==\n\n=== Packaging ===\n[[File:Reese's peanut butter cups.jpg|thumb|250px|Chocolates in aluminium foil packaging]]\n\nAluminium is used for packaging as it is highly malleable: it can be easily converted to thin sheets and folded, rolled or packed. Aluminium foil acts as a total barrier to light and oxygen (which cause fats to oxidise or become rancid), odours and flavours, moistness, and germs, and so it is used broadly in food and pharmaceutical packaging, including long-life packs ([[aseptic processing|aseptic packaging]]) for drinks and dairy goods, which allows storing without refrigeration. Aluminium foil containers and trays are used to bake pies and to pack [[Take-out|takeaway]] meals, ready snacks and long life [[pet]] foods.\n\nAluminium foil is widely sold into the [[consumer]] market, often in rolls of {{convert|500|mm|abbr=on}} width and several metres in length.<ref>[http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 Examples of products]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218165509/http://www.reynoldspkg.com/reynoldskitchens/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=1337 |date=2008-12-18 }}</ref> It is used for wrapping food in order to preserve it, for example, when storing leftover food in a [[refrigerator]] (where it serves the additional purpose of preventing odour exchange), when taking [[sandwich]]es on a journey, when baking, or when selling some kinds of [[take-away]] or [[fast food]]. [[Tex-Mex]] restaurants in the [[United States]], for example, typically provide take-away [[burrito]]s wrapped in aluminium foil.\n\n=== Insulation ===\nAluminium foil is widely used for radiation shield (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers ([[heat conduction]]) and cable liners (barrier and [[electrical conductivity]]). Aluminium foil's heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in [[hookah]] smoking: a sheet of perforated aluminium foil is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into direct contact with the burning coal.\n\n=== Electromagnetic shielding ===\nThe [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding effectiveness]] of aluminium foil depends upon the type of incident field (electric, magnetic, or plane wave), the thickness of the foil, and the frequency (which determines the [[skin depth]]). Shielding effectiveness is usually broken down into a reflection loss (the energy bounces off the shield rather than penetrates it) and an absorption loss (the energy is dissipated within the shield).\n\nAlthough aluminium is non-magnetic, it is a good conductor, so even a thin sheet reflects almost all of an incident electric wave. At frequencies more than 100&nbsp;MHz, the ''transmitted'' electric field is attenuated by more than 80 [[decibel]]s (dB) (less than 10<sup>\u22128</sup> = 0.00000001 of the power gets through) <ref>{{Citation |last=Ott |first=Henry |title=Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems |year=1976 |publisher=Wiley Interscience |isbn=0-471-65726-3 |doi= }}. {{Harvtxt|Ott|1976|loc=figure 6-13}} graphs reflection loss for copper, and shows electric field and plane wave losses at greater than 90&nbsp;dB.</ref> -- however actual energy absorption is minimal:  the remaining high-frequency rf energy is almost perfectly reflected from uniform flat aluminium surface, and thus, reflected signal may continue to propagate internally, and if holes or passages of suitable geometry exist in the shield, signal propagation may continue out through those, the aluminium being good material for implementation of a microwave-frequency [[waveguide]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThin sheets of aluminium are not very effective at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields.  The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth. A field travelling through one skin depth will lose about 63 per cent of its energy (it is attenuated to 1/e = 1/2.718... of its original energy).  Thin shields also have internal reflections that reduce the shielding effectiveness.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ott|1976|pp=155&ndash;156}}</ref>  For effective shielding from a magnetic field, the shield should be several skin depths thick.  Aluminium foil is about {{convert|1|mil|um}}; a thickness of {{convert|10|mil|um}} (ten times thicker) offers less than 1&nbsp;dB of shielding at 1&nbsp;kHz, about 8&nbsp;dB at 10&nbsp;kHz, and about 25&nbsp;dB at 100&nbsp;kHz.  At these frequencies a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic material]] such as [[mild steel]] is much more effective, due to different and complementary [[Permeability_(electromagnetism)|electromagnetic permeability]] properties, and common practical shielding implementations utilise both an inner high-frequency reflective material such as aluminium, preferably bonded (via [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] or [[electroplating]], done to avoid capacitance between separated layers), to a more substantial structural ferromagnetic shell, usually mild steel (in specialized applications, more expensive, less structurally useful and less workable materials may be preferred.)  Despite the relative low mass density of aluminium, this design is usually both lighter and more effective than an equivalently absorptive design utilizing aluminium alone (although with poorer heat dissipative properties, typically accommodated by improved ventilation, which itself needs careful consideration in order to preserve the desired shielding effectiveness).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Cooking ===\nAluminium foil is also used for [[barbecue|barbecuing]] delicate foods,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&pg=PA207&dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&f=false|title=Kitchen on Fire!: Mastering the Art of Cooking in 12 Weeks (or Less)|last=Said|first=Olivier|last2=MikeC|first2=Chef|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780738214535|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022234134/https://books.google.com/books?id=zXm8ccnB0P8C&pg=PA207&dq=Aluminium+foil+is+used+for+barbecuing+delicate+foods&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjkLH6r9nUAhUI6mMKHdTmBmEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Aluminium%20foil%20is%20used%20for%20barbecuing%20delicate%20foods&f=false|archivedate=2017-10-22}}</ref> such as mushrooms and vegetables. Using this method, sometimes called a '''hobo pack''', food is wrapped in foil, then placed on the grill, preventing loss of moisture that may result in a less appealing texture.\n\nAs is the case with all metallic items, aluminium foil reacts to being placed in a [[microwave oven]]. This is because of the [[electromagnetic field]]s of the microwaves inducing electric currents in the foil and high [[voltage|potentials]] at the sharp points of the foil sheet; if the potential is sufficiently high, it will cause [[electric arc]]ing to areas with lower potential, even to the air surrounding the sheet.  Modern microwave ovens have been designed to prevent damage to the [[cavity magnetron]] tube from microwave energy reflection, and aluminium packages designed for microwave heating are available.<ref>Huss, G. (1997) Microwaveable Packaging and Dual-Ovenable Materials in The Wiley Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology, 2nd ed., edited by Brody, A. and Marsch, K. New York, John Wiley and Sons</ref>\n\n=== Art and decoration ===\nHeavier foils made of aluminium are used for art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright metallic colours. Metallic aluminium, normally silvery in colour, can be made to take on other colours through [[anodization|anodisation]]. Anodising creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright metallic colours. These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging.\n\n=== Geochemical sampling ===\nFoil is used by organic/petroleum geochemists for protecting rock samples taken from the fields and in the labs where the sample is subject to [[biomarker]] analysis. While plastic or cloth bags are normally used for a geological sampling exercise, cloth bags are permeable and may allow organic solvents or oils (such as oils imparted from the skin) to taint the sample, and traces of the plastics from plastic bags may also taint the sample. Foil provides a seal to the ingress of organic solvents and does not taint the sample. Foil is also used extensively in geochemical laboratories to provide a barrier for the geochemist, and for sample storage.\n\n=== Ribbon microphones ===\nThe material used in many [[ribbon microphone]]s is aluminium leaf, or \"[[Metal leaf|imitation silver leaf]]\", as it is sometimes called. This is pure aluminium and is around 0.6 to 2.0 micrometres thick. It is virtually the same material that the BBC used on [[Coles 4038|Coles ribbon]]s, with the exception that they also hand beat the leaf even thinner. They did this by sandwiching the ribbon between toilet paper and beating with a [[ball-peen hammer]]. This \"cold forges\" the leaf. The aluminium leaf was then annealed for an hour in an oven to restore flexibility. Corrugations must also be imparted into the ribbon: Coles used 25 per inch (1&nbsp;mm cycle). RCA 44BX has 19 corrugations per inch (0.7&nbsp;mm cycle) and is around {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} long; RCA 77 has 13 corrugations per inch (0.5&nbsp;mm cycle). RCA ribbon material is around 1 to 1.5 micrometres (0.00005&nbsp;inch) thick. The new Nady ribbon plus AEA both state that they use 2 micrometre aluminium ribbon in their microphones.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Environmental issues ==\n{{See also|Aluminium recycling}}\n\nSome aluminium foil products can be [[recycling|recycled]] at around 5% of the original [[energy]] cost,<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]]|url=http://asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|title=Action Plan, page 5, table 2: 4.2 vs. 0.19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406032451/http://www.asiapacificpartnership.org/english/tf_aluminium.aspx|archivedate=2009-04-06|access-date=2009-04-24}}</ref> although many aluminium laminates are not recycled due to difficulties in separating the components and low yield of aluminium metal.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aluminium}}\n* [[Tin foil hat]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Aluminium foil}}\n* [http://www.alufoil.org European Aluminium Foil Association]\n* [http://www.aluminum.org Aluminium Association (USA)]\n* [http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Aluminum-Foil.html Aluminium Foil] from ''How Products Are Made,'' vol. 1, Thomson Gale (2005).\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4OTj9yNOak How It's Made: Aluminium Foil] - HowItsMadeEpisodes channel on YouTube.\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Chemistry}}\n\n[[Category:Cooking utensils]]\n[[Category:Aluminium]]\n[[Category:Packaging materials]]\n[[Category:Metalworking]]\n[[Category:Swiss inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Wiki13565", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 941654983 by108.44.250.213(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil"}

The first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciers\u2014but more difficult to apply to [[old moraine]]s, which are defined by their particular morphology, since their origin is debated. Some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers, while medial moraines of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier.\n\n===Lateral moraines===\n[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Lateral moraines above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.]]\n\nLateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by [[frost shattering]] of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The [[till]] is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts. Because lateral moraines are deposited on top of the glacier, they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore, as the glacier melts, lateral moraines are usually preserved as high ridges.\n\n[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|Moraines clearly seen on a side glacier of the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]]. The '''lateral moraine''' is the high snow-free bank of debris in the top left hand quarter of the picture. The '''medial moraine''' is the double line of debris running down the centre-line of the glacier.]]\n\nLateral moraines stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements, causing it to melt or [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublime]] less than the uncovered parts of the glacier. Multiple lateral moraines may develop as the glacier advances and retreats.\n\n===Ground moraines===\n[[File:Ground moraine 9004.jpg|thumb|Ground moraines create irregular, rolling topography]]\nGround moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains. They are accumulated at the base of the ice as [[Till#Types of till|lodgment till]], but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats.  In [[wikt:alpine|alpine]] glaciers, ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines. Ground moraines may be modified into [[drumlins]] by the overriding ice.\n\n====Rogen moraines====\n{{main|Rogen moraine}}\nRogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an [[ice sheet]]. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like [[tigerstripe]]s on [[aerial photograph]]s. Rogen moraines are named after [[Lake Rogen]]<ref name=Moller>M\u00f6ller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial reshaping of preexisting landforms.

Cascade mountains in the background.]]\n\nEnd moraines, or [[terminal moraine]]s, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier.  They usually reflect the shape of the [[Glacier terminus|glacier's terminus]].  Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines.  End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine.  There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional.  Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier.  Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat.  After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.\n\n===Recessional moraine===\nRecessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.<ref name=\"Benn & Evans\"/><ref>\"Moraine\". ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition (2009): 1. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 6 Oct. 2010.</ref>\n\n===Medial moraine===\n[[File:Nuussuaq-peninsula-moraines.jpg|thumb|Medial moraines, [[Nuussuaq Peninsula]], [[Greenland]]]]\n\nA medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]] in the [[Kluane National Park]], [[Yukon]], has a ridge of medial moraine 1&nbsp;km wide.\n\n{{wide image|Bruggen-PioXI FaceCompleteCroppedIMG5642.jpg|600px|align-cap=center|The prominent dark streak at the left quarter is forming a medial moraine.<br>This is seen as a mudflat at the water's surface. ([[Br\u00fcggen Glacier]], [[Patagonia]])}}\n\n===Supraglacial moraines===\nSupraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the [[ablation zone]], melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.\n\n===Washboard moraines===\n[[Washboard moraine]]s, also known as '''minor''' or '''corrugated moraines''', are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. The name \"washboard moraine\" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].\n\n===Veiki moraine===\n{{main|Veiki moraine}}\nA Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern [[Sweden]] and parts of [[Canada]].\n\n==See also==\n{{see also|List of glacial moraines}}\n; Geologic features related to moraines\n:* {{annotated link|Glacial landform}}\n:* {{annotated link|Drumlin}}\n:* {{annotated link|Esker}}\n:* {{annotated link|Moraine-dammed lake}}\n:* {{annotated link|Terminal moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Rogen moraine}}\n; Moraine examples\n:* {{annotated link|Dogger Bank}}\n:* {{annotated link|Kettle Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Long Island}}\n:* {{annotated link|Oak Ridges Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Valparaiso Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Cypress Hills (Canada)}}\n:* {{annotated link|Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Easterbrook, D.

In [[wikt:alpine|alpine]] glaciers, ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines. Ground moraines may be modified into [[drumlins]] by the overriding ice.\n\n====Rogen moraines====\n{{main|Rogen moraine}}\nRogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an [[ice sheet]]. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like [[tigerstripe]]s on [[aerial photograph]]s. Rogen moraines are named after [[Lake Rogen]]<ref name=Moller>M\u00f6ller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial reshaping of preexisting landforms. ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', '''25''':362\u2013389</ref> in [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Sweden]], the landform's type locality.\n\n===End or terminal moraines===\n{{main|Terminal moraine}}\n[[Image:Erratics-Cascades-PB110028.JPG|thumb|left|Multiple erratics on the terminal moraine of the Okanogan Lobe. Cascade mountains in the background.]]\n\nEnd moraines, or [[terminal moraine]]s, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier.  They usually reflect the shape of the [[Glacier terminus|glacier's terminus]].  Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines.  End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine.  There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional.  Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier.  Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat.  After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.\n\n===Recessional moraine===\nRecessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.<ref name=\"Benn & Evans\"/><ref>\"Moraine\". ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition (2009): 1. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 6 Oct. 2010.</ref>\n\n===Medial moraine===\n[[File:Nuussuaq-peninsula-moraines.jpg|thumb|Medial moraines, [[Nuussuaq Peninsula]], [[Greenland]]]]\n\nA medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]] in the [[Kluane National Park]], [[Yukon]], has a ridge of medial moraine 1&nbsp;km wide.\n\n{{wide image|Bruggen-PioXI FaceCompleteCroppedIMG5642.jpg|600px|align-cap=center|The prominent dark streak at the left quarter is forming a medial moraine.<br>This is seen as a mudflat at the water's surface. ([[Br\u00fcggen Glacier]], [[Patagonia]])}}\n\n===Supraglacial moraines===\nSupraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the [[ablation zone]], melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.\n\n===Washboard moraines===\n[[Washboard moraine]]s, also known as '''minor''' or '''corrugated moraines''', are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. The name \"washboard moraine\" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]].\n\n===Veiki moraine===\n{{main|Veiki moraine}}\nA Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern [[Sweden]] and parts of [[Canada]].\n\n==See also==\n{{see also|List of glacial moraines}}\n; Geologic features related to moraines\n:* {{annotated link|Glacial landform}}\n:* {{annotated link|Drumlin}}\n:* {{annotated link|Esker}}\n:* {{annotated link|Moraine-dammed lake}}\n:* {{annotated link|Terminal moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Rogen moraine}}\n; Moraine examples\n:* {{annotated link|Dogger Bank}}\n:* {{annotated link|Kettle Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Long Island}}\n:* {{annotated link|Oak Ridges Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Valparaiso Moraine}}\n:* {{annotated link|Cypress Hills (Canada)}}\n:* {{annotated link|Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Easterbrook, D.

In 1920 he was in the title role of Moli\u00e8re play, adapted by Edward Bass and directed by George Dr\u00e9manem, called ''The Lord of Pras\u00e1tkova KHHilar''. Ra\u0161ilov briefly moved into cabaret Bang, but where were several other prominent comics (Vlasta Burian, Ferenc Futurist, Eman Fiala, Josef and Karel Noll Rovensky) cabaret and a half year after the operation ceased due to scheduling conflicts in the file. But back in 1921 at the behest of the then new head of drama Karel Hugo Hilar, Ra\u0161ilov came to test and from 1 September 1921, he became a full member of the drama set the National Theatre in Prague, where he worked almost until his death in 1955.\n\nFrom performing in a cabaret actors took a lot of practical experience, including the ability to improvise and make contact with the audience. He had a remarkable ability to individually transform classical stage roles according to their temperament and outlook, which eventually made him very popular.\n\nEven at the time of the adoption of the National Theatre in antique helped free Emil Berner in Prague and later he became a collector of antiques. After returning from the war he lived in Old Town Iron doors, and later bought a houseboat, where he lived for several years and who kept the anchor Podoli or \u017dof\u00edn opposite the National Theatre. The cruise on the [[Vltava River]] took Zbraslav and decided to buy a house here. To get money, began to actively engage the film. In the Czech film industry he began working even before the First World War in 1913, in the pioneering days of the Czech [[silent film]].\n\n==Selected filmography==\n* ''[[The Last Bohemian (1931 film)|The Last Bohemian]]'' (1931)\n* ''[[Morality Above All Else]]'' (1937)\n* ''[[Andula Won]]'' (1937)\n* ''[[I'll Be Right Over]]'' (1942)\n* ''[[Rozina, the Love Child]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[The Adventurous Bachelor]]'' (1946)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|0711189|Sa\u0161a Ra\u0161ilov}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rasilov, Sasa}}\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1955 deaths]]\n[[Category:Czech male film actors]]\n[[Category:Czech male silent film actors]]\n[[Category:20th-century Czech male actors]]\n[[Category:Male actors from Prague]]\n", "name_user": "Lugnuts", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%C5%A1a_Ra%C5%A1ilov"}

An object in this state is said to be ''invisible'' (literally, \"not visible\"). The term is often used in [[fantasy]]/[[science fiction]], where objects cannot be seen by [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] or [[Technology|technological]] means; however, its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world, particularly in [[physics]] and [[perceptual psychology]] classes.\n\nSince objects can be seen by light in the [[visible spectrum]] from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer's [[Human eye|eye]], the most natural form of invisibility (whether real or fictional) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light (that is, it allows light to pass through it). This is known as \n[[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], and is seen in many naturally occurring materials (although no naturally occurring material is 100% transparent).\n\nInvisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Moreno|first1 = Ivan|last2 = Jauregui-S\u00e1nchez|first2 = Y.|last3 = Avenda\u00f1o-Alejo|first3 = Maximino|year = 2014|title = Invisibility assessment: a visual perception approach|url = http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2014.pdf|journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A|volume = 31|issue = 10|pages = 2244\u20132248|doi = 10.1364/josaa.31.002244|pmid = 25401251|bibcode = 2014JOSAA..31.2244M|access-date = 2016-01-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170808173026/http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2014.pdf|archive-date = 2017-08-08|url-status = dead}}</ref> For example, invisibility depends on the [[Human eye|eye]]s of the observer and/or the instruments used.
