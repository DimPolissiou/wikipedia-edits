Based on an original idea by [[Lee Unkrich]], it is directed by him and co-directed by [[Adrian Molina]]. The film's voice cast stars [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]], [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Alanna Ubach]], [[Ren\u00e9e Victor]], [[Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living and to reverse his family's ban on music.\n\nThe concept for ''Coco'' is inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for research. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score. ''Coco'' is the first film with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino principal cast, with a cost of $175{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Coco'' premiered on October 20, 2017, during the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in [[Morelia, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/coco-la-nueva-pelicula-de-disney%E2%80%A2pixar-abrira-el-15o-ficm/|title=''Coco'', the new Disney\u2022Pixar movie, will open the 15th FICM|date=July 21, 2017|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> It was theatrically released in Mexico the following week, the weekend before {{lang|es|D\u00eda de los Muertos}}, and in the United States on November 22, 2017.

His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance and join Coco for a visit to the living, where Miguel plays and sings for his living and dead relatives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]] as Miguel, a 12-year-old aspiring musician.<ref name=VFMexicoAgeTrump /><ref name=\"AMCharacterFamily\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Disney-Pixar Introduces the 'Coco' Character Family|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-pixar-introduces-the-coco-character-family/|language=English|accessdate= June 8, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as H\u00e9ctor, a charming [[trickster]] in the Land of the Dead who enlists Miguel to help him visit the Land of the Living.

In one version of the story, his family is cursed with singing when trying to speak, which was included as a technique to add music to a story where music is banned. Originally, Lopez and Anderson-Lopez had written many more songs for the film than what ended up in the released version; one piece that survived in storyboard until late into the production was an expository song that explained the Mexican holiday to viewers to begin the film. In another song, Miguel's mother explains the tradition of shoe-making in their family, and how this means he is not allowed to pursue music.<ref>{{Citation|title=Coco: Deleted Scenes with commentary|date=2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qurIuw_LCgc|volume=|pages=|publisher=Pixar Animation Studios|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n''Coco'' is the first-ever motion picture with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino cast, with a cost of $175\u2013200{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Pixar-s-Coco-feasts-on-Justice-12384697.php|title=Pixar's 'Coco' feasts on 'Justice League' at box office|date=November 26, 2017|publisher=[[New Haven Register]]|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Gonzalez first auditioned for the role of Miguel when he was nine, and was finalized in the role two years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/24/meet-anthony-gonzalez-teen-breakout-star-pixars-animated-coco/885828001/|title=Meet Anthony Gonzalez, the teen breakout star of Pixar's animated 'Coco'|website=Usatoday.com}}</ref> Speaking of his character, Gonzalez said: \"[Miguel and I] both know the importance of following our dream and we know the importance of following our tradition, so that's something that I connected with Miguel a lot\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/culture/ct-redeye-coco-movie-actor-anthony-gonzalez-interview-20180223-story.html|title='Coco' star Anthony Gonzalez connects his passion for music with his love for family|first=Sad\u00e9|last=Carpenter|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref> During the film's pre-production, Miguel was originally set to be voiced by a child named Emilio Fuentes, but was removed from the role after his voice deepened due to puberty over the course of the film's production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/coco-how-pixar-brought-day-dead-story-life-1065932|title='Coco': How Pixar Brought Its \"Day of the Dead\" Story to Life|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the ''Coco'' team made an official announcement about the cast, which revealed that Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Ren\u00e9e Victor, and Anthony Gonzalez would voice the characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/pixar-coco-gael-garcia-bernal-dia-de-los-muertos-miguel|title=Pixar's Coco Is a \"Love Letter to Mexico\" When It's Needed Most|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|website=Vanityfair.com}}</ref> Bratt, who voiced De la Cruz, was \"moved\" when he realized that Disney-Pixar wanted to make a film on Latin culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gael-garc-a-bernal-talks-singing-pixars-coco-1056611|title=Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal Talks About Singing in Pixar's 'Coco'|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> Disney officials closely monitored Bernal's movements and expressions while he voiced the characters and used their input for animating H\u00e9ctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-gael-garcia-bernal/|title=Coco Was A 'Collaborative Process' At Pixar|date=November 21, 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBratt voiced Ernesto De la Cruz, a character who he described as \"the Mexican Frank Sinatra\"; \"[a] larger than life persona\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-benjamin-bratt-anthony-gonzalez/|title=Benjamin Bratt Is Mexican Sinatra In Coco|date=November 21, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> On the advice of the filmmakers, Bratt watched videos of equivalent Mexican actors including [[Jorge Negrete]] and [[Pedro Infante]].

As Unkrich did not want to break Pixar's tradition, Ratzenberger was given a minor role with one word making it Ratzenberger's shortest Pixar role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2017/08/28/john-ratzenberger-confirmed-coco/|title=John Ratzenberger Confirmed for \"Coco\"|author=Laughing Place Disney Newsdesk|work=Laughing Place|date=August 28, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nOn April 13, 2016, Unkrich announced that they had begun work on the animation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2016/04/13/lee-unkrich-confirms-that-animation-has-officially-started-on-coco/ |title=Lee Unkrich Confirms That Animation Has Officially Started on Coco! |first=Rachel|last=Berman|date=April 13, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506080229/https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2016/04/13/lee-unkrich-confirms-that-animation-has-officially-started-on-coco/ |archivedate=May 6, 2016 }}</ref> The film's writer, [[Adrian Molina]], was promoted to co-director in late 2016.<ref name=\"VFMexicoAgeTrump\" /> Unkrich said that Pixar wanted \"to have as much contrast between\" the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead, and that many techniques were used to differentiate the worlds. Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Coco (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2017|11|10}}\n| recorded     = August\u2013October 2017\n| venue        = \n| studio       = {{flat list|*[[Warner Bros.

The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living and to reverse his family's ban on music.\n\nThe concept for ''Coco'' is inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for research. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score.

His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place.

In one version of the story, his family is cursed with singing when trying to speak, which was included as a technique to add music to a story where music is banned. Originally, Lopez and Anderson-Lopez had written many more songs for the film than what ended up in the released version; one piece that survived in storyboard until late into the production was an expository song that explained the Mexican holiday to viewers to begin the film.

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse.

The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalisation without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in party president [[S.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but fell short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognising the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

In his teens, he joined the [[Punk subculture|punk]] scene and moved to [[Camden Town]] to live in a squat and play in bands. After discovering the works of [[Elmore Leonard]] he began writing book reviews for the ''[[NME]]'' and ''The Sunday Times''<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hasted|first=Nick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/23/fiction|title=A life in writing: John Williams|date=2001-06-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>.\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1994, Williams published ''Into the Badlands'' (1991), a combination of travelogue and interviews with American crime fiction authors, including Elmore Leonard, James Ellroy, Carl Hiassen, and Sara Paretsky.

In light of this goal, the Washington legislature passed an act for the creation of the ''Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington'' on March 28, 1890 and then was signed into law by the Governor, [[Elisha P. Ferry]].<ref name =WSU1/> However, a second act of legislature expanded the school educational mission to include general arts and sciences.

After an exhaustive examination of bidding towns such as [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and other towns on the [[wheat]]-growing Palouse region, the state's new land-grant college opened to 59 students in Pullman on January 13, 1892, offering three major courses of study: agriculture, engineering, and domestic science.<ref name =WSU1/> Pullman was possibly selected because of a generous land gift by the city and its railroad connections to Spokane and [[Portland, Oregon]]. A five-member Board of Regents was appointed with [[George W. Lilley]] acting as the school's first President.<ref name =WSU1/> The school started out with a faculty of five, with a student-body largely consisting of children from the surrounding community, who, if they were residents of Washington would have attended tuition-free. The year 1897 saw the first graduating class of seven men and women.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html History by Decade 1890\u20131899] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721010805/http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html |date=July 21, 2009 }} for Washington State University</ref>\n\n====The Bryan years====\n[[Enoch Albert Bryan]], appointed July 22, 1893 and serving for 22 years, was the first influential president of WSU and considered by many as the true founder of the university.<ref name =WSU1/> Bryan previously served as the president of [[Vincennes University]] in Indiana and was an alumnus of [[Indiana University]] and held a graduate degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. When Bryan learned he was nominated for the presidency by a friend in Oregon, he had never even heard of the college. Before Bryan's arrival, the fledgling university suffered through significant organizational instability. Under Bryan's term as president, the curriculum included both a practical and liberal arts component, where chemistry, mathematics as well as history, English literature and two foreign languages were core courses, required for graduation regardless of major.<ref name =WSU1/> Under Bryan, music and art held importance too, in 1905 he gained the approval of the Board of Regents for a School of Music. Bryan guided the college toward respectability and is arguably the most influential figure in the university's history. The landmark clock tower in the center of campus is his namesake. As the college approached the end of its first decade of existence, Bryan and others tried to garner the necessary support to change the name of the school, which resulted in the introduction of a bill to change the school name to \u201cWashington State College\u201d in 1899. This and similar efforts in 1901 and 1903 were defeated with strong opposition for attempting to create another state university which would undermine the clout of the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. However, in 1905 the school was finally able to officially change its name to the \u201cState College of Washington\u201d or more informally as ''Washington State College'' (WSC).<ref name =WSU1/>\n\n===Washington State College===\n[[Ernest O. Holland]] succeeded Enoch Bryan as President of the Washington State College in 1915.<ref name =WSU1/> That same year, a close friend of his whom he shared a room with while studying at Columbia University, [[Henry Suzzallo]], became the President of the University of Washington. Holland's early years as president and friendship with Suzzallo would be challenged during his tenure as president. In 1909, the institutional rivalry between WSC and UW worsened when state legislators, the majority of which held seats in western Washington, were dismayed to find a foreign language department, an English Department headed by a Harvard-educated PhD, a school of architecture, and many departments with graduate students. The legislative committee promptly advised demoting the college to \u201ctrade school\u201d status, an idea which Suzzallo supported.<ref name =WSU1/> Suzzallo penned a letter to Holland promising to make WSC \u201cthe greatest school of agriculture in the world\u201d only if Holland agreed to abandon all other disciplines to UW; Suzzallo's proposal specifically sought to shut down WSC's schools of architecture and pharmacy.<ref name =WSU1/> After years of wrangling, the Washington legislature decided against limiting the academic mission and scope of WSC.<ref name =WSU1/> The two presidents and their respective institutions would continue to have a row over curriculum and state appropriations until Suzzallo  was relieved of his position in 1926 due to the influence of Washington governor, [[Roland H. Hartley]].<ref name =WSU1/> In trying to outdo his former peer at UW, Holland wanted to build a library that rivaled the grandness of the newly-built [[Suzzallo Library|library]] at UW that bears Suzzallo's name. Funding for the Holland Library was delayed by the state however until 1950.\n\n[[File:WSU 1925 thompson-bryan halls.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Thompson and Bryan Halls in 1925]]\n\nBudgetary woes hit WSC in the [[Great Depression]] years starting in the 1930s. The budget, faculty, salaries, and enrollment slumped dramatically. Enrollment didn't reach pre-Depression levels until 1936 and salaries until 1937 in nominal terms.<ref name =WSU1/> With the start of [[World War II]], the Washington State College was contracted by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to house and train the [[Army Signal Corps]] where they were given pre-flight school training and lessons in [[Japanese language]]. The college hosted as many as 1,900 military personnel in the vacated dormitories and fraternities.<ref name =WSU2>{{cite web | last = Tate| first = Cassandra| title = Washington State University, Part 2| work = Essay 5704| publisher = HistoryLink| date = May 26, 2004| url = https://historylink.org/File/5704| accessdate = June 9, 2019}}</ref> It was during this time in 1944 however, when WSC saw the exciting introduction of the [[Cougar Gold cheese|Cougar Gold]] brand of sharp white cheddar cheese from the campus creamery. The cheese was developed and gets its namesake from dairy bacteriologist Dr. N.S. Golding who was studying molds for cheese production.<ref name =WSU2/> After the war ended and the passing of the [[G.I. Bill]], the college went from having virtually no men on campus to being inundated with them. The school had to scramble to accommodate the former servicemen by buying migrant housing and using temporary housing units provided by the federal government.<ref name =WSU2/> The campus became so crowded, that President [[Wilson Compton (academic)|Wilson Compton]] mulled moving the college to Spokane, but in 1947, he ultimately figured that it would be too impractical.\n\n===Washington State University===\n\nOn September 1, 1959, the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] passed a bill unopposed that officially changed the name to ''Washington State University''.<ref name =WSU2/><ref name=nrokffn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JP1XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O_cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5907%2C481257 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name for WSC near O.K. |date=February 4, 1959 |page=2}}</ref><ref name=nnfsc >{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1gFYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H_cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5197%2C1025216 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name near for State College |date=August 5, 1959 |page=18 }}</ref> The maturing university partly owed the success of this to the establishment of the WSU Honors College, which is one of the oldest in the nation and a highly respected university program for gifted students.<ref name =WSU2/> The university joined the [[Athletic Association of Western Universities]] in 1962, which included the University of Washington, and four other universities in California at the time.<ref name =WSU2/> In an effort to improve the graduate program and research credentials of WSU, a low-grade nuclear reactor was constructed, funded by [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] grants, and new doctoral programs were introduced.\n\nBy the 1970s, WSU's enrollment quadrupled from its level in the 1940s to 14,000 students with an influx from the [[Baby Boom Generation]].

Open to all students, they create educational, entertaining and cultural programming for WSU students and the local community. Committees include Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (APASC), Black Student Union (BSU), Environmental Sustainability Alliance (ESA), Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), International Students' Council (ISC), Ku Ah Mah, KZUU Radio, Middle Eastern Students Association (MESA), Movimiento Estudianti Chicano de Aztian (MEChA), Student Legal Services (SLS), Veteran's Student Committee, and GIVE on the Pullman Campus. There are also more than 300 registered student organisations (RSOs) that cover many interests. All ASWSU committees are members of \"Committee Squared,\" the coalition of all ASWSU Committee leaders. ASWSU also consists of the President and Vice President who oversee the Executive Staff. The staff consists of a variety of directors and assistant directors advancing student causes via student life, diversity affairs, campus life, and others. The 23-member Senate represents students via academic colleges as well as the Honors College and Freshman class. The Senate meets weekly to debate legislation, hear reports from the Executive Staff, and appoint the various officers of ASWSU. The Senate also provides financial support to the nearly 400 registered student organizations on campus via the Senate Finance Committee. Finally, the Election Board and the Judicial Board complete the association.\n\nThere are several other influential student organizations. Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, the United Greek Council, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council are governmental bodies for university-recognized Greek social organizations. The Residence Hall Association is a government body for students in the residence halls, governing all of the residence halls on campus excluding McEachern and Stimson Halls. It is the second biggest registered student organization at Washington State, representing about 4,700 on-campus resident students.\n\nThe board of directors of the Students' Book Corporation has a total of nine directors. Five are students at WSU, two are faculty and two are administrative directors. These people oversees the non-profit campus bookstore separate from WSU.<ref name=\"sbcboard.wsu.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://sbcboard.wsu.edu/faq/|title=faq {{!}} SBC Board {{!}} Washington State University|website=sbcboard.wsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The Students' Book Corporation provides a 10% point of sale discount. On average the dividend total has been about $85,000. This is then received at ASWSU organizations at each campus to be distributed to various groups and activities.<ref name=\"sbcboard.wsu.edu\"/> The Compton Union Board (CUB) oversees the management of the [[Student activity center|student union]] building and its services. The University Recreation Board oversees the management of university recreation. The Student Alumni Connection hosts several major campus events.\n\nThe Student Entertainment Board (SEB) is a student-led board composed of undergraduate students. Positions on the board include: Spotlight, Films, Up All Night, Lectures, CUB Gallery, Concerts, VPLAC (Visual, Performing, and Literary Arts Committee), Special Event (Homecoming and Springfest), Associate Director, and Director. They are responsible for bringing diverse arts & entertainment to campus.\n\nThe Coalition for Women Students provides much of the multicultural programs on campus, including the annual Women of Color symposium, the Week Without Violence, and [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] rally and march. CWS is made up of Association for Pacific and Asian Women, Black Women's Caucus, Mujeres Unidas, Native American Women's Association, and the [[YWCA]] of WSU. The organization also funds the all-volunteer Women's Transit, a safe door-to-door transportation program for women who would otherwise walk alone at night.\n\n===Student government===\nWSU has two representative [[student body]] organizations: the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU) founded in 1915 and the Graduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA) founded about 1970.\n\nIn recent years, the student body completed several major projects on campus. In addition to passing a $15 transportation fee to increase Pullman Transit's service, the student body also voted to remodel the Compton Union Building. The building closed in May 2006 and re-opened in August 2008. In March 2006, ASWSU voted to support the renovation of [[Martin Stadium]], adding $25 per semester to undergraduate student fees.\n\n====Associated Students of Washington State University====\n{{main|Associated Students of Washington State University}}\nASWSU's organizational framework is similar to that of most American governments complete with an appointed and confirmed judiciary, elected representatives (from districts) to a senate, and an annually elected president and vice-president team. The president also has a paid staff led by the chief of staff ranging in size from 6\u201312 members, depending on the year.\n\n====Graduate and Professional Students Association====\nGPSA is similar, but differs in that it lacks a judiciary or a paid staff. The GPSA is centered on the senate which is composed of a large number of senators that represent different graduate and professional programs. The GPSA also has an executive Council that consists of the (GPSA) President, Vice-Presidents, and nine District Representatives elected from the nine colleges of WSU.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:CougQ400.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Horizon Air]] [[Q400]] in unique WSU livery]]\n''[[Washington State Magazine]]'' is the alumni and research magazine of Washington State University.

The university communities are connected by [[Washington State Route 270|Highway 270]] and the [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]].\n\nThe Palouse is defined by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which supports one of the world's most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are wheat, [[peas]], [[barley]], and [[lentils]]. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular blue-pink sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college's colors (later changed to the current crimson and gray colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.\n\n===Built environment===\n[[File:WSU Thompson hall.jpg|Thompson Hall (1894), known as the Administration Building<br />until renamed in 1972<ref name=wsubldghist>{{cite news|url=http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/MASC/buildings.html|publisher=Washington State University Libraries|title=History of WSU buildings|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>|thumb]]\nCampus architecture is diverse, but its prevailing image is perhaps best characterized by a handful of red-brick buildings in the older campus core designed in a neo-Georgian or Renaissance Revival mode, many of which were constructed between the world wars.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://research.libraries.wsu.edu/xmlui/handle/2376/5280|title=Historic Resource Survey and Analysis|first1=Weddell|last1=James|first2=Washington State University.

By the 1990s, the university began to encourage eye-catching designs, including a 1994 addition to the old Holland Library (now called Terrell Library), by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now [[ZGF Architects LLP]]) with a curving sweep of windows and a cone-shaped skylight above its atrium; an amenity-filled recreation center with a massive jacuzzi and fireplace in 2001; and the Samuel H. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, or \"CUE,\" named for WSU president Smith, who served from 1985\u20132000.  The latter two buildings were designed by Yost Grube Hall of Portland.\n\nThe busiest part of campus is the [[Glenn Terrell]] Friendship Mall, referred to as \"the mall\" by students. This walkway, which prior to the 1970s was a road with parking available along the sides, was named after Glenn Terrell, who was WSU's president from 1967 to 1985. President Terrell's secretary was known to set meetings 10 minutes behind schedule to make up for the time he would spend talking to students along the way. The library complex (Terrell and Holland Libraries), the student union (Compton Union Building), and three academic buildings surround the mall.

Many freshmen live in residence halls, while some live in fraternity and sorority houses or in off-campus housing. After their first year, many students move to apartments, several owned by WSU. Most apartments are less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|1|adj=on}} <!-- {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on|spell=in}} --> from campus. Off-campus housing is broken into two sections that are commonly known by students; College Hill and Apartment Land.  College Hill houses many members of the Greek community who no longer live-in their fraternity/sorority houses, and are commonly known as \"live-outs\".\n\n===Residence halls===\nA number of the residence halls are [[coed|co-ed]], but there are single-gender living environments as well as a variety of other living options that include age-restricted housing, a mix of domestic and international students, and a global learning community. All of the residence halls, except for McEachern, are part of the [[Residence Hall Association|RHA]] (Residence Hall Association).\n\nResidence halls on campus include:\n*The Hill Halls: Community/Duncan-Dunn, Honors, [[Virgil T. McCroskey|McCroskey]], Wilmer-Davis and Stevens\n*The Northside Halls: [[Regents Hill]], Scott-Coman, Streit-Perham, Northside, and Global Scholars (opened in fall of 2015)\n*The South Central Halls: Gannon-Goldsworthy, Stimson and Waller\n*The Upper Division Halls: Rogers, Orton and McEachern\n*The Complex: Stephenson East, Stephenson North and Stephenson South\n*Opened in Fall 2009: Olympia Avenue\n*Opened in Fall 2015: Global Scholars\n\nEach hall has its own government which organizes events, manages its budget, and acts as a forum for student involvement. These halls range in size from the exclusive Stevens Hall (approximately 70 residents), to the massive Stephenson Complex (approximately 1200 residents total). The highlight of the year for the residence halls is often [[Homecoming]] Week when the residence halls, off-campus students, and [[Fraternities and sororities|Greeks]] compete in various events. Events such as the chariot race determine the winner of Homecoming Week. In the past decade, the winner of Homecoming Week has most often been a residence hall team. In 2008, the Residence Halls swept Homecoming. Waller/Wilmer-Davis/Stevens took first, Scott-Coman took second and Stimson/Regents took third.\n\n===Greek Life===\nThere are currently 27 [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] in the Interfraternity Council, 14 sororities in the Panhellenic Council, 14 fraternities and sororities in the United Greek Association, and 10 fraternities and sororities in the National Panhellenic Council at Washington State University. There are 26 primarily residential fraternities and 14 primary residential sororities that are located on College Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/how-to-join/ |title=How to Join &#124; Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life at WSU |publisher=Gogreek.wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-10-18}}</ref> [[Kappa Sigma]] is the oldest national fraternity at WSU with a founding date in 1909 and [[Alpha Delta Pi]] was the first sorority at WSU with a founding date in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wsm.wsu.edu/ourstory/index.php?title=A_Century_of_Greek_Life_at_WSU |title=A Century of Greek Life at WSU - Our Story |publisher=Wsm.wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-10-18}}</ref> The average chapter size of the community organizations is 64 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/our-community/facts-and-figures/ |title=Facts and Figures &#124; Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life at WSU |publisher=Gogreek.wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-10-18}}</ref> Between 25-30 percent of undergraduate students are in the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]] annually.<ref>[http://cub.wsu.edu/myFiles/CUB_community_guide4.pdf CUB Community Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531193330/http://cub.wsu.edu/myFiles/CUB_community_guide4.pdf |date=May 31, 2010 }} \"Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life,\" pages 8\u20139</ref> Greek affiliates have the highest GPA on WSU's campus, averaging 3.2 for sorority women and 2.97 for fraternity men based on figures from Spring 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/media/429252/wsu-fall-2018-grade-report.pdf |title=Listing |website=gogreek.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Individuals join houses by going through recruitment, often a week at the beginning of one or both semesters where chapter members hold events to meet potential new members. Washington State University has a zero tolerance policy on [[hazing]] both potential new members and current members.

The Greek Row and College Hill area is a diverse community of students, faculty members, and families. College Hill is also home to the President of WSU, [[Kirk Schulz]]. College Hill is supported by The College Hill Association, whose mission envisions a vibrant, diverse, and improving community that welcomes all residents and values the historic character of the neighborhood. Restaurants, thrift stores and various bars line Colorado Street, the main street on College Hill.  The bars on College Hill include Cougar Cottage (informally, the Coug), currently in its 87th year of operation, Valhalla (informally, V-Hall), and Stubblefield's (informally, Mike's); all boast a large number of customers on the weekends as well as many themed weekdays.\n\n===Recreation and the outdoors===\nThe university has the {{convert|160000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center (SRC), which was the largest student recreation center in the United States when it was opened in 2001.<ref>Brailsford & Dunlavey [http://www.facilityplanners.com/portfolio//wash_state_u/recreation97/ Washington State University Recreation Center Feasibility Analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113160600/http://www.facilityplanners.com/portfolio/wash_state_u/recreation97/ |date=November 13, 2007 }} Retrieved on November 27, 2007</ref> The SRC contains a {{convert|1/8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} elevated indoor track, four basketball courts, two volleyball courts, roller hockey rink, four racquetball courts, swimming pool, 50-person jacuzzi, free weights, weight machines, cardio equipment, exercise instruction rooms, outdoor sand volleyball courts, and a low to high ropes course. The campus also has several other basketball courts, dance rooms, a climbing wall, and the Outdoor Recreation Center where students can check out equipment or register for various events and trips. The {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]] links [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] with [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] and links to the Latah Trail to [[Troy, Idaho|Troy]], {{convert|22|mi}} from WSU. Another bike trail wraps around the Pullman campus (about {{convert|8|mi|km|disp=or|spell=in}} long). The school has an intramural program, and club sports are also very popular on campus. The university also has The Chinook, a 69,000 square foot space designed for students. It features fitness facilities, study spaces, social spaces for events, and Freshens Fresh Food Studio.\n\nThe campus added a {{convert|7305|yd|adj=on}} championship golf course in 2008; Palouse Ridge, a $12.3 million project, opened on August 29. It intends to improve the school's golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni a new reason to visit the campus. From the back tees (Crimson), the course rating is 75.9 with a slope rating of 140.<ref name=prslope>{{cite web|url=http://ncrdb.usga.org/NCRDB/courseTeeInfo.aspx?CourseID=3894|title=Course Rating and Slope Database\u2122 Palouse Ridge|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> It replaces a sub-standard 9-hole course that was built in 1923 and was mostly unimproved. It closed in 2006 for the redesign to create Palouse Ridge, on the same site and adjacent land. The [[University of Idaho Golf Course|UI Golf Course]] in Moscow also offers student rates. It opened in 1937 and added its second nine in 1970; the back tees are at {{convert|6637|yd}}, with a course rating of 72.4 and a slope rating of 135.<ref name=usgaui>{{cite web|url=http://ncrdb.usga.org/NCRDB/courseTeeInfo.aspx?CourseID=3976|publisher=USGA|title=Course Rating and Slope Database\u2122: UIGC|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWithin {{convert|35|mi}}, many students have the option to hike at [[Kamiak Butte]] and [[Steptoe Butte]]. Moscow Mountain, at {{convert|4983|ft}} in the Palouse Range in Idaho, provides opportunities for hiking and mountain biking. For aquatic adventures, students can cliff jump or boat at the [[Snake River]]. Farther out, white-river rafting, downhill skiing, and hiking in the nearby foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] are available. WSU formerly operated its own alpine ski area in Idaho, the [[North-South Ski Bowl]], which was sold in the early 1980s.\n\n===Arboretum and Botanical Garden===\nThe WSU Arboretum Committee continues to develop an Arboretum and Botanical Garden on a hilltop adjacent to the Lewis Alumni Center. In addition, about {{convert|95|acre|ha}} on the east edge of campus has been identified for a more expansive Arboretum and Botanical Garden, including a wildlife center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |title=WSU Arboretum Proposal, retrieved November 2009 |accessdate=November 20, 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531184042/http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Students interested in contributing to the development of the WSU Arboretum are working with the Native Plant & Landscape Restoration Nursery to help establish tree plantings, future habitat restoration sites, or native plant displays that may be part of a campus green belt design.\n\n===Environmental record and sustainability initiatives===\n\n====Energy use on campus====\n\nWSU has one LEED-silver certified building on campus, and two more buildings that meet LEED-silver standards but are not certified. The university has also encouraged the use of energy efficient lighting, energy management systems, and insulating steam lines, to reduce wasted power.<ref name=\"The College Sustainability Report Card\">{{cite web|last=The College Sustainability Report Card|title=Washington State University- Green Report Card 2011|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/washington-state-university|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Energy profile====\n\nWSU's energy is generated in part by an on-campus steam plant, powered by natural gas with diesel fuel back-up.  This accounts for 38% of carbon emissions, or 53,922 metric tonnes eCO2 out of 136,166 metric tons total.  The remaining carbon emissions is predominantly the result of purchased electricity (52%), with less than 10% the result of commuting, air travel, refrigerant leaks, and waste incineration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington State University|title=Climate Action Plan|url=http://sustainability.wsu.edu/File/WSU_PullmanClimateActionPlan.pdf|accessdate=April 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116185742/http://sustainability.wsu.edu/File/WSU_PullmanClimateActionPlan.pdf|archivedate=January 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The university has committed to lowering carbon emissions 36% below 2005 levels by 2035, though thus far emission levels have remained relatively flat.<ref>{{cite web|last=American College and University President's Climate Commitment|title=Progress Report for Washington State University- Pullman|url=http://rs.acupcc.org/progress/272/|accessdate=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928094439/http://rs.acupcc.org/progress/272/|archive-date=September 28, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWSU is active in clean energy research,<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington State University|title=Clean Technology|url=http://cleantech.wsu.edu/}}</ref> though the campus does not currently have any renewable energy installations.<ref name=\"The College Sustainability Report Card\"/>\n\n====Energy investments====\n\nWSU does not currently commit to establishing a committee or policy that supports climate and sustainability shareholder proposals at companies where the endowment funds are invested.<ref>{{cite web|last=American College and University President's Climate Challenge|title=Implentation Profile for Washington State University|url=http://rs.acupcc.org/ip/779/|accessdate=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928094437/http://rs.acupcc.org/ip/779/|archive-date=September 28, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The university is exploring investing in renewable energy, but otherwise is focused on optimizing investment returns.

Undergraduates who have an idea to improve campus sustainability can apply for funding from the Cougar Green Fund, which is funded by an optional $5 student fee. WSU also provides a free [[Bicycle sharing system|bikeshare]] system through its Greenbike program.\n\n===Museums and collections===\n[[File:00-02-32, campus artwork - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Public art]]\nThe Museum of Art/WSU has several permanent collections, including the Ernest O.

Varsity athletics include men's baseball, basketball, [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[American football|football]], golf, and track and field, as well as women's basketball, cross country, golf, [[Sport rowing|rowing]], soccer, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and [[track and field]]. In the past WSU had varsity programs of [[boxing]], [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], gymnastics, and men's swimming. In 1917, WSU won its first national championship in men's basketball. In 1937, Roy Petragallo and Ed McKinnon won the NCAA boxing championship, another national championship. The Cougars third and most recent national championship was earned in 1977 in indoor track and field.\n\n[[File:WSUMartinStadium-08-16-2012.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Martin Stadium]] in [[2012 Washington State Cougars football team|2012]],<br />home of [[Washington State Cougars football|Cougar football]]]]\n\nUniversity Recreation also supports 26 club sports, including [[bowling]], men's crew, [[cricket]], cycling, [[equestrianism|equestrian]] show team, men's and women's [[flag football]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[polo]], men's and women's [[ice hockey]], [[judo]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[lumberjack|logger sports]], [[rodeo]], men's [[rugby union]], women's rugby, sailing, [[ski]] team, men's soccer, women's fast-pitch softball, [[taekwondo]], [[triathlon]], [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], men's and women's volleyball, [[water polo]] and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]].\n\n[[File:martinstadium3.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Cougar fans celebrate after<br />the [[Apple Cup]] win in [[2004 Washington State Cougars football team|2004]]]]\n\nWashington State's biggest rival is the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies|Huskies]]. Strong rivalries also exist between WSU and the other Pac-12 teams of the Pacific Northwest: the [[University of Oregon]] [[Oregon Ducks|Ducks]] and [[Oregon State University]] [[Oregon State Beavers|Beavers]]. WSU's closest geographic rival is the [[University of Idaho]] [[Idaho Vandals|Vandals]], a fellow land-grant school only {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} east of Pullman across the state line in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]]. Conference rivals until 1959, their rivalry football game, the \"[[Battle of the Palouse]]\", was played on an annual basis from 1901 until 1978 when the NCAA Division I split. After Idaho returned to Division I-A, a renewed series lasted a decade, from 1998 until [[2007 Washington State Cougars football team|2007]]. The renewed series was dropped from the schedule due to the Cougars' continued dominance of the [[Idaho Vandals football|Vandals]] in the series, and each school's ability to generate more revenue by playing other opponents. Vandal head coach [[Robb Akey]], a former WSU defensive coordinator, preferred the game as an occasional rather regular attraction. On hiatus for five seasons, it returned for one year in [[2013 Washington State Cougars football team|2013]].<ref name=bop2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|publisher=Washington State University Athletics|title=Cougars add Idaho to 2013 football schedule|date=May 1, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105113101/http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|archivedate=January 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n{{main|List of Washington State University people}}\n\nThe University has 196,257 living alumni in fall 2015, according to WSU Quick Facts.<ref name=\"Quick Facts \"/>\n\nAmong the 39 WSU alumni to receive the Regents' Distinguished Alumnus Award since 1962 are recipient of the 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry [[Irwin Rose]], broadcaster [[Edward R.

In light of this goal, the Washington legislature passed an act for the creation of the ''Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington'' on March 28, 1890 and then was signed into law by the Governor, [[Elisha P. Ferry]].<ref name =WSU1/> However, a second act of legislature expanded the school educational mission to include general arts and sciences. The university and the experiment station would aid enterprise by improving farm management, conducting research, and teaching the skills needed to be better farmers.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stratton| first = David H.| title =Spokane and the Inland Empire: An Interior Pacific Northwest Anthology| publisher = Washington State University Press| location = Pullman, Washington | page= 8| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-87422-277-7}}</ref> WSU's role as a statewide institution became clear in 1894 with the launch of its first [[agricultural experiment station]] west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] near [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Chesley| first = Frank| title = Washington State Legislature approves the Puyallup Agricultural Experiment Station on March 9, 1891.| work = Essay 8378| publisher = HistoryLink| date = November 25, 2007| url = https://www.historylink.org/File/8378| accessdate = June 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Location map\n|USA Washington\n|relief     = 1\n|label      = <small>Washington State University</small>\n|lat        = 46.73\n|long       = -117.16\n|caption    = Location in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]\n|marksize   = 5\n|float      = \n|background = \n|width      = 220\n}}\n\nThe site of the land-grant college was to be determined by a three-member committee appointed by the governor according to the legislation, and it stipulated that the site must be located in the southeast corner of the state. After an exhaustive examination of bidding towns such as [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and other towns on the [[wheat]]-growing Palouse region, the state's new land-grant college opened to 59 students in Pullman on January 13, 1892, offering three major courses of study: agriculture, engineering, and domestic science.<ref name =WSU1/> Pullman was possibly selected because of a generous land gift by the city and its railroad connections to Spokane and [[Portland, Oregon]]. A five-member Board of Regents was appointed with [[George W. Lilley]] acting as the school's first President.<ref name =WSU1/> The school started out with a faculty of five, with a student-body largely consisting of children from the surrounding community, who, if they were residents of Washington would have attended tuition-free. The year 1897 saw the first graduating class of seven men and women.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html History by Decade 1890\u20131899] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721010805/http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html |date=July 21, 2009 }} for Washington State University</ref>\n\n====The Bryan years====\n[[Enoch Albert Bryan]], appointed July 22, 1893 and serving for 22 years, was the first influential president of WSU and considered by many as the true founder of the university.<ref name =WSU1/> Bryan previously served as the president of [[Vincennes University]] in Indiana and was an alumnus of [[Indiana University]] and held a graduate degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. When Bryan learned he was nominated for the presidency by a friend in Oregon, he had never even heard of the college. Before Bryan's arrival, the fledgling university suffered through significant organizational instability. Under Bryan's term as president, the curriculum included both a practical and liberal arts component, where chemistry, mathematics as well as history, English literature and two foreign languages were core courses, required for graduation regardless of major.<ref name =WSU1/> Under Bryan, music and art held importance too, in 1905 he gained the approval of the Board of Regents for a School of Music. Bryan guided the college toward respectability and is arguably the most influential figure in the university's history. The landmark clock tower in the center of campus is his namesake. As the college approached the end of its first decade of existence, Bryan and others tried to garner the necessary support to change the name of the school, which resulted in the introduction of a bill to change the school name to \u201cWashington State College\u201d in 1899. This and similar efforts in 1901 and 1903 were defeated with strong opposition for attempting to create another state university which would undermine the clout of the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. However, in 1905 the school was finally able to officially change its name to the \u201cState College of Washington\u201d or more informally as ''Washington State College'' (WSC).<ref name =WSU1/>\n\n===Washington State College===\n[[Ernest O. Holland]] succeeded Enoch Bryan as President of the Washington State College in 1915.<ref name =WSU1/> That same year, a close friend of his whom he shared a room with while studying at Columbia University, [[Henry Suzzallo]], became the President of the University of Washington. Holland's early years as president and friendship with Suzzallo would be challenged during his tenure as president. In 1909, the institutional rivalry between WSC and UW worsened when state legislators, the majority of which held seats in western Washington, were dismayed to find a foreign language department, an English Department headed by a Harvard-educated PhD, a school of architecture, and many departments with graduate students. The legislative committee promptly advised demoting the college to \u201ctrade school\u201d status, an idea which Suzzallo supported.<ref name =WSU1/> Suzzallo penned a letter to Holland promising to make WSC \u201cthe greatest school of agriculture in the world\u201d only if Holland agreed to abandon all other disciplines to UW; Suzzallo's proposal specifically sought to shut down WSC's schools of architecture and pharmacy.<ref name =WSU1/> After years of wrangling, the Washington legislature decided against limiting the academic mission and scope of WSC.<ref name =WSU1/> The two presidents and their respective institutions would continue to have a row over curriculum and state appropriations until Suzzallo  was relieved of his position in 1926 due to the influence of Washington governor, [[Roland H. Hartley]].<ref name =WSU1/> In trying to outdo his former peer at UW, Holland wanted to build a library that rivaled the grandness of the newly-built [[Suzzallo Library|library]] at UW that bears Suzzallo's name. Funding for the Holland Library was delayed by the state however until 1950.\n\n[[File:WSU 1925 thompson-bryan halls.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Thompson and Bryan Halls in 1925]]\n\nBudgetary woes hit WSC in the [[Great Depression]] years starting in the 1930s. The budget, faculty, salaries, and enrollment slumped dramatically. Enrollment didn't reach pre-Depression levels until 1936 and salaries until 1937 in nominal terms.<ref name =WSU1/> With the start of [[World War II]], the Washington State College was contracted by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to house and train the [[Army Signal Corps]] where they were given pre-flight school training and lessons in [[Japanese language]]. The college hosted as many as 1,900 military personnel in the vacated dormitories and fraternities.<ref name =WSU2>{{cite web | last = Tate| first = Cassandra| title = Washington State University, Part 2| work = Essay 5704| publisher = HistoryLink| date = May 26, 2004| url = https://historylink.org/File/5704| accessdate = June 9, 2019}}</ref> It was during this time in 1944 however, when WSC saw the exciting introduction of the [[Cougar Gold cheese|Cougar Gold]] brand of sharp white cheddar cheese from the campus creamery. The cheese was developed and gets its namesake from dairy bacteriologist Dr. N.S. Golding who was studying molds for cheese production.<ref name =WSU2/> After the war ended and the passing of the [[G.I. Bill]], the college went from having virtually no men on campus to being inundated with them. The school had to scramble to accommodate the former servicemen by buying migrant housing and using temporary housing units provided by the federal government.<ref name =WSU2/> The campus became so crowded, that President [[Wilson Compton (academic)|Wilson Compton]] mulled moving the college to Spokane, but in 1947, he ultimately figured that it would be too impractical.\n\n===Washington State University===\n\nOn September 1, 1959, the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] passed a bill unopposed that officially changed the name to ''Washington State University''.<ref name =WSU2/><ref name=nrokffn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JP1XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O_cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5907%2C481257 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name for WSC near O.K. |date=February 4, 1959 |page=2}}</ref><ref name=nnfsc >{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1gFYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H_cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5197%2C1025216 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name near for State College |date=August 5, 1959 |page=18 }}</ref> The maturing university partly owed the success of this to the establishment of the WSU Honors College, which is one of the oldest in the nation and a highly respected university program for gifted students.<ref name =WSU2/> The university joined the [[Athletic Association of Western Universities]] in 1962, which included the University of Washington, and four other universities in California at the time.<ref name =WSU2/> In an effort to improve the graduate program and research credentials of WSU, a low-grade nuclear reactor was constructed, funded by [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] grants, and new doctoral programs were introduced.\n\nBy the 1970s, WSU's enrollment quadrupled from its level in the 1940s to 14,000 students with an influx from the [[Baby Boom Generation]]. President [[Glenn Terrell]] took steps to increase funding for undergraduate and graduate education amid the nationwide recession of the mid 1970s. Terrell didn't make any major cuts to the athletics department however, which didn't go unnoticed and was a cause for anger about his leadership among some of the faculty.<ref name =WSU2/>\n\n====State-wide university====\nBeginning with the start of [[Samuel H. Smith (educator)|Samuel H. Smith]]\u2019s term as President in 1985, marked a large period of growth for WSU. In 1989, WSU gained branch campuses in [[Spokane]], the [[Tri-Cities of Washington|Tri-Cities]], and [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] with established extension offices and research centers in all regions of the state, with facilities in [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]] and [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]].<ref name =WSU2/><ref>{{cite web | last = Gibson| first = Elizabeth| title = Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center, WSU Prosser| work = Essay 7684| publisher = HistoryLink| date = April 18, 2006| url = https://www.historylink.org/File/7684| accessdate = June 9, 2019}}</ref> Smith proved to be a consummate fundraiser, with about $760 million raised during his term, thanks in some part to [[Microsoft]] co-founder and alumnus [[Paul Allen]].<ref name =WSU2/> In the 1990s Smith began to clamp down and take action regarding [[Alcohol abuse among college students|student alcohol abuse]] and disciplinary issues after some high-profile incidents on campus in an effort to improve the university's image. The efforts seemed to have paid off when WSU lost its rank and was completely excluded from ''[[The Princeton Review]]''\u2019s [[party school]] list in August 2000.<ref name =WSU2/> Improving the quality of education was the defining goal of the university under [[V. Lane Rawlins]], who raised admission requirements and sought to improve the academic profile of the school with improved curricula and research facilities. After Rawlins retired in 2006, [[Elson Floyd]] succeeded him as president. Under Floyd's leadership, increasing the diversity of the student body and continuing to raise the stature and reach of the university were a focus. In his eight years as president, WSU enrollment figures went up by 17 percent, including a 12.5 percent increase in the number of students of color, the amount of research grants awarded to WSU tripled to $600 million a year, and he led expansions in all of WSU's branch campuses-most notably successfully campaigning for the creation of the public medical school that now bears his name at [[Washington State University Spokane|WSU - Spokane]], the [[Elson S.

Committees include Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (APASC), Black Student Union (BSU), Environmental Sustainability Alliance (ESA), Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), International Students' Council (ISC), Ku Ah Mah, KZUU Radio, Middle Eastern Students Association (MESA), Movimiento Estudianti Chicano de Aztian (MEChA), Student Legal Services (SLS), Veteran's Student Committee, and GIVE on the Pullman Campus. There are also more than 300 registered student organisations (RSOs) that cover many interests. All ASWSU committees are members of \"Committee Squared,\" the coalition of all ASWSU Committee leaders. ASWSU also consists of the President and Vice President who oversee the Executive Staff. The staff consists of a variety of directors and assistant directors advancing student causes via student life, diversity affairs, campus life, and others. The 23-member Senate represents students via academic colleges as well as the Honors College and Freshman class. The Senate meets weekly to debate legislation, hear reports from the Executive Staff, and appoint the various officers of ASWSU. The Senate also provides financial support to the nearly 400 registered student organizations on campus via the Senate Finance Committee. Finally, the Election Board and the Judicial Board complete the association.\n\nThere are several other influential student organizations. Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, the United Greek Council, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council are governmental bodies for university-recognized Greek social organizations. The Residence Hall Association is a government body for students in the residence halls, governing all of the residence halls on campus excluding McEachern and Stimson Halls. It is the second biggest registered student organization at Washington State, representing about 4,700 on-campus resident students.\n\nThe board of directors of the Students' Book Corporation has a total of nine directors. Five are students at WSU, two are faculty and two are administrative directors. These people oversees the non-profit campus bookstore separate from WSU.<ref name=\"sbcboard.wsu.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://sbcboard.wsu.edu/faq/|title=faq {{!}} SBC Board {{!}} Washington State University|website=sbcboard.wsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The Students' Book Corporation provides a 10% point of sale discount. On average the dividend total has been about $85,000. This is then received at ASWSU organizations at each campus to be distributed to various groups and activities.<ref name=\"sbcboard.wsu.edu\"/> The Compton Union Board (CUB) oversees the management of the [[Student activity center|student union]] building and its services. The University Recreation Board oversees the management of university recreation. The Student Alumni Connection hosts several major campus events.\n\nThe Student Entertainment Board (SEB) is a student-led board composed of undergraduate students. Positions on the board include: Spotlight, Films, Up All Night, Lectures, CUB Gallery, Concerts, VPLAC (Visual, Performing, and Literary Arts Committee), Special Event (Homecoming and Springfest), Associate Director, and Director. They are responsible for bringing diverse arts & entertainment to campus.\n\nThe Coalition for Women Students provides much of the multicultural programs on campus, including the annual Women of Color symposium, the Week Without Violence, and [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] rally and march. CWS is made up of Association for Pacific and Asian Women, Black Women's Caucus, Mujeres Unidas, Native American Women's Association, and the [[YWCA]] of WSU. The organization also funds the all-volunteer Women's Transit, a safe door-to-door transportation program for women who would otherwise walk alone at night.\n\n===Student government===\nWSU has two representative [[student body]] organizations: the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU) founded in 1915 and the Graduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA) founded about 1970.\n\nIn recent years, the student body completed several major projects on campus. In addition to passing a $15 transportation fee to increase Pullman Transit's service, the student body also voted to remodel the Compton Union Building. The building closed in May 2006 and re-opened in August 2008. In March 2006, ASWSU voted to support the renovation of [[Martin Stadium]], adding $25 per semester to undergraduate student fees.\n\n====Associated Students of Washington State University====\n{{main|Associated Students of Washington State University}}\nASWSU's organizational framework is similar to that of most American governments complete with an appointed and confirmed judiciary, elected representatives (from districts) to a senate, and an annually elected president and vice-president team. The president also has a paid staff led by the chief of staff ranging in size from 6\u201312 members, depending on the year.\n\n====Graduate and Professional Students Association====\nGPSA is similar, but differs in that it lacks a judiciary or a paid staff. The GPSA is centered on the senate which is composed of a large number of senators that represent different graduate and professional programs. The GPSA also has an executive Council that consists of the (GPSA) President, Vice-Presidents, and nine District Representatives elected from the nine colleges of WSU.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:CougQ400.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Horizon Air]] [[Q400]] in unique WSU livery]]\n''[[Washington State Magazine]]'' is the alumni and research magazine of Washington State University.

The university communities are connected by [[Washington State Route 270|Highway 270]] and the [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]].\n\nThe Palouse is defined by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which supports one of the world's most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are wheat, [[peas]], [[barley]], and [[lentils]]. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular blue-pink sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college's colors (later changed to the current crimson and gray colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.\n\n===Built environment===\n[[File:WSU Thompson hall.jpg|Thompson Hall (1894), known as the Administration Building<br />until renamed in 1972<ref name=wsubldghist>{{cite news|url=http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/MASC/buildings.html|publisher=Washington State University Libraries|title=History of WSU buildings|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>|thumb]]\nCampus architecture is diverse, but its prevailing image is perhaps best characterized by a handful of red-brick buildings in the older campus core designed in a neo-Georgian or Renaissance Revival mode, many of which were constructed between the world wars.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://research.libraries.wsu.edu/xmlui/handle/2376/5280|title=Historic Resource Survey and Analysis|first1=Weddell|last1=James|first2=Washington State University.

By the 1990s, the university began to encourage eye-catching designs, including a 1994 addition to the old Holland Library (now called Terrell Library), by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now [[ZGF Architects LLP]]) with a curving sweep of windows and a cone-shaped skylight above its atrium; an amenity-filled recreation center with a massive jacuzzi and fireplace in 2001; and the Samuel H. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, or \"CUE,\" named for WSU president Smith, who served from 1985\u20132000.  The latter two buildings were designed by Yost Grube Hall of Portland.\n\nThe busiest part of campus is the [[Glenn Terrell]] Friendship Mall, referred to as \"the mall\" by students. This walkway, which prior to the 1970s was a road with parking available along the sides, was named after Glenn Terrell, who was WSU's president from 1967 to 1985. President Terrell's secretary was known to set meetings 10 minutes behind schedule to make up for the time he would spend talking to students along the way. The library complex (Terrell and Holland Libraries), the student union (Compton Union Building), and three academic buildings surround the mall. The new crimson-colored cube that distinguishes the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art is slated to open in the spring of 2018, just across from the club seating entrance to the football stadium.\n\n[[File:Stadium Way - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium Way]]\n\nThe [[Washington State Cougars football|football]] venue, [[Martin Stadium]], named after Governor [[Clarence D.

Today, Thompson Hall is home to the foreign language department and also provides the administrative offices for the College of Arts and Sciences. Bryan Hall is perhaps the most noticeable building on campus, with its tall four-sided tower enclosing a carillon and displaying a clock that lights up neon-red in the evening. Stevens Hall is an all-women's dormitory pitched with many gables. Stevens Hall and Thompson Hall are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and both were designed by the Seattle firm of Stephen & Josenhans.<ref name=wsubldghist/>\n\nAlso significant are the Lewis Alumni Centre and the Webster Physical Science Building. The alumni center is an old beef cattle barn dating from the 1920s that was thoroughly transformed in the 1980s into event space and offices for the WSU Alumni Association. Rooms in the alumni center include the Board of Regents' Boardroom, Lighty Library, the Athletics Hall of Fame, the Alumni Presidents' Room, and the \"Great Hall\" for large social events on the second floor. Webster Hall, completed in 1974 and designed by the Seattle-based architectural firm of Naramore, Bain, Brady, and Johanson [[(NBBJ)]] is the tallest building on campus with twelve above-ground floors of offices and an expansive view of the region from a lounge on the northwest side of the top floor.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1923, [[Rudolph Weaver]] was the first chairman of the architecture department.

Many freshmen live in residence halls, while some live in fraternity and sorority houses or in off-campus housing. After their first year, many students move to apartments, several owned by WSU. Most apartments are less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|1|adj=on}} <!-- {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on|spell=in}} --> from campus. Off-campus housing is broken into two sections that are commonly known by students; College Hill and Apartment Land.  College Hill houses many members of the Greek community who no longer live-in their fraternity/sorority houses, and are commonly known as \"live-outs\".\n\n===Residence halls===\nA number of the residence halls are [[coed|co-ed]], but there are single-gender living environments as well as a variety of other living options that include age-restricted housing, a mix of domestic and international students, and a global learning community. All of the residence halls, except for McEachern, are part of the [[Residence Hall Association|RHA]] (Residence Hall Association).\n\nResidence halls on campus include:\n*The Hill Halls: Community/Duncan-Dunn, Honors, [[Virgil T. McCroskey|McCroskey]], Wilmer-Davis and Stevens\n*The Northside Halls: [[Regents Hill]], Scott-Coman, Streit-Perham, Northside, and Global Scholars (opened in fall of 2015)\n*The South Central Halls: Gannon-Goldsworthy, Stimson and Waller\n*The Upper Division Halls: Rogers, Orton and McEachern\n*The Complex: Stephenson East, Stephenson North and Stephenson South\n*Opened in Fall 2009: Olympia Avenue\n*Opened in Fall 2015: Global Scholars\n\nEach hall has its own government which organizes events, manages its budget, and acts as a forum for student involvement. These halls range in size from the exclusive Stevens Hall (approximately 70 residents), to the massive Stephenson Complex (approximately 1200 residents total). The highlight of the year for the residence halls is often [[Homecoming]] Week when the residence halls, off-campus students, and [[Fraternities and sororities|Greeks]] compete in various events. Events such as the chariot race determine the winner of Homecoming Week. In the past decade, the winner of Homecoming Week has most often been a residence hall team. In 2008, the Residence Halls swept Homecoming. Waller/Wilmer-Davis/Stevens took first, Scott-Coman took second and Stimson/Regents took third.\n\n===Greek Life===\nThere are currently 27 [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] in the Interfraternity Council, 14 sororities in the Panhellenic Council, 14 fraternities and sororities in the United Greek Association, and 10 fraternities and sororities in the National Panhellenic Council at Washington State University.

The {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]] links [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] with [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] and links to the Latah Trail to [[Troy, Idaho|Troy]], {{convert|22|mi}} from WSU. Another bike trail wraps around the Pullman campus (about {{convert|8|mi|km|disp=or|spell=in}} long). The school has an intramural program, and club sports are also very popular on campus. The university also has The Chinook, a 69,000 square foot space designed for students. It features fitness facilities, study spaces, social spaces for events, and Freshens Fresh Food Studio.\n\nThe campus added a {{convert|7305|yd|adj=on}} championship golf course in 2008; Palouse Ridge, a $12.3 million project, opened on August 29. It intends to improve the school's golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni a new reason to visit the campus. From the back tees (Crimson), the course rating is 75.9 with a slope rating of 140.<ref name=prslope>{{cite web|url=http://ncrdb.usga.org/NCRDB/courseTeeInfo.aspx?CourseID=3894|title=Course Rating and Slope Database\u2122 Palouse Ridge|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> It replaces a sub-standard 9-hole course that was built in 1923 and was mostly unimproved. It closed in 2006 for the redesign to create Palouse Ridge, on the same site and adjacent land. The [[University of Idaho Golf Course|UI Golf Course]] in Moscow also offers student rates.

Moscow Mountain, at {{convert|4983|ft}} in the Palouse Range in Idaho, provides opportunities for hiking and mountain biking. For aquatic adventures, students can cliff jump or boat at the [[Snake River]]. Farther out, white-river rafting, downhill skiing, and hiking in the nearby foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] are available. WSU formerly operated its own alpine ski area in Idaho, the [[North-South Ski Bowl]], which was sold in the early 1980s.\n\n===Arboretum and Botanical Garden===\nThe WSU Arboretum Committee continues to develop an Arboretum and Botanical Garden on a hilltop adjacent to the Lewis Alumni Center. In addition, about {{convert|95|acre|ha}} on the east edge of campus has been identified for a more expansive Arboretum and Botanical Garden, including a wildlife center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |title=WSU Arboretum Proposal, retrieved November 2009 |accessdate=November 20, 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531184042/http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Students interested in contributing to the development of the WSU Arboretum are working with the Native Plant & Landscape Restoration Nursery to help establish tree plantings, future habitat restoration sites, or native plant displays that may be part of a campus green belt design.\n\n===Environmental record and sustainability initiatives===\n\n====Energy use on campus====\n\nWSU has one LEED-silver certified building on campus, and two more buildings that meet LEED-silver standards but are not certified.

Strong rivalries also exist between WSU and the other Pac-12 teams of the Pacific Northwest: the [[University of Oregon]] [[Oregon Ducks|Ducks]] and [[Oregon State University]] [[Oregon State Beavers|Beavers]]. WSU's closest geographic rival is the [[University of Idaho]] [[Idaho Vandals|Vandals]], a fellow land-grant school only {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} east of Pullman across the state line in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]]. Conference rivals until 1959, their rivalry football game, the \"[[Battle of the Palouse]]\", was played on an annual basis from 1901 until 1978 when the NCAA Division I split. After Idaho returned to Division I-A, a renewed series lasted a decade, from 1998 until [[2007 Washington State Cougars football team|2007]]. The renewed series was dropped from the schedule due to the Cougars' continued dominance of the [[Idaho Vandals football|Vandals]] in the series, and each school's ability to generate more revenue by playing other opponents. Vandal head coach [[Robb Akey]], a former WSU defensive coordinator, preferred the game as an occasional rather regular attraction. On hiatus for five seasons, it returned for one year in [[2013 Washington State Cougars football team|2013]].<ref name=bop2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|publisher=Washington State University Athletics|title=Cougars add Idaho to 2013 football schedule|date=May 1, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105113101/http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|archivedate=January 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n{{main|List of Washington State University people}}\n\nThe University has 196,257 living alumni in fall 2015, according to WSU Quick Facts.<ref name=\"Quick Facts \"/>\n\nAmong the 39 WSU alumni to receive the Regents' Distinguished Alumnus Award since 1962 are recipient of the 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry [[Irwin Rose]], broadcaster [[Edward R.

Notable past parliamentary groups in the House of Commons include the [[Ginger Group]] (1924\u20131932; split from [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]), [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] (2001\u20132002; split from [[Canadian Alliance]]), and [[Qu\u00e9bec debout]] (2018; split from [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]).\n\n====Senate====\nThe [[Senate of Canada]] currently has three non-party [[parliamentary group]]s: the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG), the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]], and, as of November 4, 2019, the [[Canadian Senators Group]] (CSG). The Senate Liberal Caucus is made up of Senators who are personally members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], but form a group that is organizationally and politically independent of both the Liberal Party structure and the Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. The ISG and the CSG include non-partisan senators who, while not sharing a cohesive ideology, platform, or membership in ''any'' political party, have formed a caucus to provide organizational support and better leverage parliamentary resources. Conservative senators remain formally affiliated with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Additionally, on January 24, 2020, the Senate Liberal Caucus is expected to lose their status as an official Senate caucus when the caucus is reduced to eight senators with the retirement of Senator [[Joseph A. Day]]. A minimum of nine members is required for official caucus status which entitles the grouping to access to funding for a research budget and other supports and privileges.<ref name=\"nat-post-new-senate-bloc\">{{cite news |author1=Jesse Snyder |author2=Brian Platt |title=New Senate bloc looking to protect 'regional interests' could hamper Trudeau's efforts to pass legislation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/new-senators-group-of-11-could-complicate-liberal-efforts-to-get-legislation-passed |accessdate=5 November 2019 |work=National Post |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Additionally, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party member Senators [[Serge Joyal|Joyal]] and [[Lillian Dyck|Dyck]] will retire from the Senate on February 1, 2020, and August 24, 2020, respectively,<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\">{{cite web |title=Senators List |url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators-list/ |website=Senate of Canada |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref> which means that the soon-to-be unofficial parliamentary group will be further reduced to six Senators, who would then be officially styled as non-affiliated Senators regardless of an unofficial parliamentary grouping they ''may'' or ''may not'' opt to maintain.<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\" />\n\nFacing extinction, on November 14, 2019, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Joseph Day]] announced during a press conference that the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] had been officially disbanded, with its current complement of nine members forming a brand new, non-partisan [[parliamentary group]] in the Progressive Senate Group. Unlike the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG) and newly-formed [[Canadian Senators Group]], which impose either prohibitions or limits, respectively, on outside partisan activities, there was no mention that the new Progressive Senate Group would have similar limits; however, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Day]] confirmed that, like the aforementioned two groups, the PSG would not have whipped votes, and the requirements of membership included supporting or holding \"progressive\" political values, support of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and supporting a new relationship with Canada's Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\">{{cite news |last1=Tasker |first1=John Paul (J.P.) |title=There's another new faction in the Senate: the Progressive Senate Group |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/new-faction-progressive-senate-group-1.5358269 |accessdate=14 November 2019 |publisher=CBC News |date=14 November 2019}}</ref> With this dissolution, as of November 14, 2019, the Canadian Senate no longer has a Liberal Senator, the first time since Canada's confederation in 1867.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\" /> On November 18, Percy Downe left to join the [[Canadian Senators Group]].

It was founded as the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. From 1938 until 1943 its candidates ran under the banner Unity or United Progressive. In 1943 it adopted the name [[Labor-Progressive Party]]. It won one seat under this name in 1945. In 1959 it reverted to the name Communist Party of Canada and has kept that name to the present.\n\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada unofficially uses the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\", but Elections Canada does not allow it to be registered by that name because of potential confusion with the Communist Party of Canada.\n\n;Labour Party\nLabour Party candidates ran under numerous different designations:\n* Conservative-Labour (1872\u20131875)\n* Farmer Labour\n* Farmer-United Labour\n* Labour-Farmer\n* [[Liberal-Labour (Canada)|Liberal-Labour]] (1926\u20131968)\n* National Labour (1940)\n* United Farmers-Labour (1920)\n* United Farmers of Ontario-Labour (1919\u20131940)\n\n;Liberal Party\nDuring Robert Borden's coalition government of 1917\u20131920, the Liberal Party of Canada split into two groups: the [[Liberal\u2013Unionist]] who supported the coalition and the [[Laurier Liberals]] who opposed it.\n\n;Liberal-Progressive\nSome Liberal-Progressive candidates used the designations:\n*Liberal-Labour-Progressive or\n*National Liberal Progressive.\n\n;New Democratic Party\nThe Co-operative Commonwealth Federation used the name [[New Party (Canada)|New Party]] from 1958\u20131961 while it was transitioning to become the New Democratic Party. In French, the party used a literal translation of its name, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Commonwealth Coop\u00e9ratif'', from until 1955.\n\n;Progressive Conservative Party\nThe first Conservative Party used several different names during its existence:\n*[[Liberal-Conservative Party]] (some MPs until 1911),\n*[[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] (1917\u20131921),\n*[[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] (1920\u20131921),\n*National Government (1940),\n*[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] (1942\u20132003)\n\nThe second (and current) Conservative Party of Canada was a merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\n;Progressive Party and United Farmers\nSome candidates for the Progressive Party of Canada used United Farmer designations:\n*[[Farmer (Party)|Farmer]] (1925 & 1930),\n*[[United Farmers of Canada]],\n*[[United Farmers of Alberta]], or\n*[[United Farmers of Ontario]].\n\n;Rhinoceros Party\nThe first Rhinoceros Party disbanded in 1993. When it was revived in 2006 it used the name \"neorhino.ca\". The party changed its name to Rhinoceros Party in 2010.\n\n;Social Credit Party and ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste''\nSome ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste'' used the name ''Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes'' from 1963 to 1967. One candidate used the designation ''Candidats des \u00e9lecteurs'' in 1957 and 1958. Others used the name Union des \u00e9lecteurs, although this was never formally registered.\n\nIn the 1940 election, 17 candidates ran jointly with the Social Credit Party under the name [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Politics}}\n*[[Federal political financing in Canada]]\n*[[List of political parties in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Elections in Canada}}\n{{Canadian federal political parties}}\n{{Lists of political parties in Canada}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=par&document=index&lang=e\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Federal Political Parties In Canada}}\n[[Category:Canada politics-related lists|Political parties]]\n[[Category:Lists of political parties in Canada|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=January 2019}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n}}\nIn contrast with the political party systems of many nations, Canadian political parties at the federal level are often only loosely connected with parties at the provincial level, despite having similar names and policy positions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=William|last2=Jansen|first2=Harold|title=Party System|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/party-system|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=November 7, 2018|date=December 11, 2015|quote=Although there are often provincial parties with similar names or aims as national political parties, Canadian parties are not generally well-integrated...

These groups are unaffiliated with registered political parties, are not registered with Elections Canada, and do not run candidates in Canadian federal elections. Essentially, these parliamentary groups are equivalent to political parties in the legislative context, but do not exist in an electoral capacity.\n\n====House of Commons====\nParliamentary groups in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] are typically made up of MPs that separate from a party over leadership conflicts. Notable past parliamentary groups in the House of Commons include the [[Ginger Group]] (1924\u20131932; split from [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]), [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] (2001\u20132002; split from [[Canadian Alliance]]), and [[Qu\u00e9bec debout]] (2018; split from [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]).\n\n====Senate====\nThe [[Senate of Canada]] currently has three non-party [[parliamentary group]]s: the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG), the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]], and, as of November 4, 2019, the [[Canadian Senators Group]] (CSG). The Senate Liberal Caucus is made up of Senators who are personally members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], but form a group that is organizationally and politically independent of both the Liberal Party structure and the Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. The ISG and the CSG include non-partisan senators who, while not sharing a cohesive ideology, platform, or membership in ''any'' political party, have formed a caucus to provide organizational support and better leverage parliamentary resources. Conservative senators remain formally affiliated with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Additionally, on January 24, 2020, the Senate Liberal Caucus is expected to lose their status as an official Senate caucus when the caucus is reduced to eight senators with the retirement of Senator [[Joseph A. Day]]. A minimum of nine members is required for official caucus status which entitles the grouping to access to funding for a research budget and other supports and privileges.<ref name=\"nat-post-new-senate-bloc\">{{cite news |author1=Jesse Snyder |author2=Brian Platt |title=New Senate bloc looking to protect 'regional interests' could hamper Trudeau's efforts to pass legislation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/new-senators-group-of-11-could-complicate-liberal-efforts-to-get-legislation-passed |accessdate=5 November 2019 |work=National Post |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Additionally, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party member Senators [[Serge Joyal|Joyal]] and [[Lillian Dyck|Dyck]] will retire from the Senate on February 1, 2020, and August 24, 2020, respectively,<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\">{{cite web |title=Senators List |url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators-list/ |website=Senate of Canada |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref> which means that the soon-to-be unofficial parliamentary group will be further reduced to six Senators, who would then be officially styled as non-affiliated Senators regardless of an unofficial parliamentary grouping they ''may'' or ''may not'' opt to maintain.<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\" />\n\nFacing extinction, on November 14, 2019, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Joseph Day]] announced during a press conference that the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] had been officially disbanded, with its current complement of nine members forming a brand new, non-partisan [[parliamentary group]] in the Progressive Senate Group. Unlike the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG) and newly-formed [[Canadian Senators Group]], which impose either prohibitions or limits, respectively, on outside partisan activities, there was no mention that the new Progressive Senate Group would have similar limits; however, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Day]] confirmed that, like the aforementioned two groups, the PSG would not have whipped votes, and the requirements of membership included supporting or holding \"progressive\" political values, support of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and supporting a new relationship with Canada's Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\">{{cite news |last1=Tasker |first1=John Paul (J.P.) |title=There's another new faction in the Senate: the Progressive Senate Group |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/new-faction-progressive-senate-group-1.5358269 |accessdate=14 November 2019 |publisher=CBC News |date=14 November 2019}}</ref> With this dissolution, as of November 14, 2019, the Canadian Senate no longer has a Liberal Senator, the first time since Canada's confederation in 1867.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\" /> On November 18, Percy Downe left to join the [[Canadian Senators Group]].

It was founded as the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. From 1938 until 1943 its candidates ran under the banner Unity or United Progressive. In 1943 it adopted the name [[Labor-Progressive Party]]. It won one seat under this name in 1945. In 1959 it reverted to the name Communist Party of Canada and has kept that name to the present.\n\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada unofficially uses the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\", but Elections Canada does not allow it to be registered by that name because of potential confusion with the Communist Party of Canada.\n\n;Labour Party\nLabour Party candidates ran under numerous different designations:\n* Conservative-Labour (1872\u20131875)\n* Farmer Labour\n* Farmer-United Labour\n* Labour-Farmer\n* [[Liberal-Labour (Canada)|Liberal-Labour]] (1926\u20131968)\n* National Labour (1940)\n* United Farmers-Labour (1920)\n* United Farmers of Ontario-Labour (1919\u20131940)\n\n;Liberal Party\nDuring Robert Borden's coalition government of 1917\u20131920, the Liberal Party of Canada split into two groups: the [[Liberal\u2013Unionist]] who supported the coalition and the [[Laurier Liberals]] who opposed it.\n\n;Liberal-Progressive\nSome Liberal-Progressive candidates used the designations:\n*Liberal-Labour-Progressive or\n*National Liberal Progressive.\n\n;New Democratic Party\nThe Co-operative Commonwealth Federation used the name [[New Party (Canada)|New Party]] from 1958\u20131961 while it was transitioning to become the New Democratic Party. In French, the party used a literal translation of its name, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Commonwealth Coop\u00e9ratif'', from until 1955.\n\n;Progressive Conservative Party\nThe first Conservative Party used several different names during its existence:\n*[[Liberal-Conservative Party]] (some MPs until 1911),\n*[[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] (1917\u20131921),\n*[[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] (1920\u20131921),\n*National Government (1940),\n*[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] (1942\u20132003)\n\nThe second (and current) Conservative Party of Canada was a merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\n;Progressive Party and United Farmers\nSome candidates for the Progressive Party of Canada used United Farmer designations:\n*[[Farmer (Party)|Farmer]] (1925 & 1930),\n*[[United Farmers of Canada]],\n*[[United Farmers of Alberta]], or\n*[[United Farmers of Ontario]].\n\n;Rhinoceros Party\nThe first Rhinoceros Party disbanded in 1993. When it was revived in 2006 it used the name \"neorhino.ca\". The party changed its name to Rhinoceros Party in 2010.\n\n;Social Credit Party and ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste''\nSome ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste'' used the name ''Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes'' from 1963 to 1967. One candidate used the designation ''Candidats des \u00e9lecteurs'' in 1957 and 1958. Others used the name Union des \u00e9lecteurs, although this was never formally registered.\n\nIn the 1940 election, 17 candidates ran jointly with the Social Credit Party under the name [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Politics}}\n*[[Federal political financing in Canada]]\n*[[List of political parties in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Elections in Canada}}\n{{Canadian federal political parties}}\n{{Lists of political parties in Canada}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=par&document=index&lang=e\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Federal Political Parties In Canada}}\n[[Category:Canada politics-related lists|Political parties]]\n[[Category:Lists of political parties in Canada|*]]\n", "name_user": "Walter G\u00f6rlitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Canadian English", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_parties_in_Canada"}
