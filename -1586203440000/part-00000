January 2020; he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017.\n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the [[Law school|faculty of law]] at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]]: immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the youngest chancellor in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

While the basic income was initially denoted \"minimum grant\" (''Mindestsicherung''), it will be renamed \"social aid\" (''Sozialhilfe''). The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings). To retain the basic income an application must be re-submitted every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000095750305/Mindestsicherung-Modell-bringt-Einschnitte-und-ermoeglicht-Boni|website=derstandard.at|title=Mindestsicherung: Was das neue Modell bringt|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.krone.at/1881854|website=amp.krone.at|title=Mindestsicherung Neu: Wartefrist f\u00fcr Zuwanderer|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the changes will merge the unemployment insurance (''Arbeitslosengeld'') with the emergency aid (''Notstandshilfe''); the merger's result will then be called \"unemployment insurance NEW\" (''Arbeitslosengeld NEU''). While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years. However, when people's eligibility for the old unemployment insurance expired they could claim the constantly-renewable but less awarding emergency aid.

With the new compact, authorities will be empowered to order [[telecommunication companies]] to save a person's data up to one year if they are suspected of committing a specific crime. Should the initial suspicion not be substantiated throughout the investigation, then authorities' directive to store data will turn void and the surveillance target must be informed of their investigation. Furthermore, the optical and acoustic surveillance in the public are also planned to be expanded, therefore authorities will be able to access the video and audio surveillance of government operated or funded organisations (such as public transportation services, airports and railway stations), who are obliged to store recordings for a tenure of four weeks. The \"license plate recognition systems\" (''Kennzeichenerkennungssysteme'') are also intended to be advanced, with them being able to detect the driver, license plate, type and color of any car.

The cabinet stated that \"centralizing the social insurance system will improve services for the insured\".\n\nFollowing insurance organizations will be merged: \n* the nine health insurances of [[States of Austria|Austria's nine states]] (''Gebietskrankenkassen'') into the federalized \"Austrian Health Insurance\" (\u00d6GK), \n* the Social Insurance for the Commercial Economy with the one of the farmers into the Social Insurance for Independents (SVS), \n* the Insurance for Railways and Mining with the Insurance for Governmental Officials into the \"BVAEB\".\n\nThe Pension Insurance (PVA) and the Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) will remain untouched. In addition the Association of Austrian Social Insurances (''Hauptverband der \u00f6sterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger''), which comprises all social insurance organisations, will be reduced and disempowered when the amendment is in effect.\n\nThe project will officially begin in April 2019 with the initiation of a parliamentary transitional committee overseeing the fusion. The committee will be abolished at the end of 2019 and starting 2020 the new organisation and structure will be in full effect.\n\nThe opposition (consisting of [[SP\u00d6]], [[NEOS - The New Austria|NEOS]] and [[NOW - List Pilz|NOW]]), the chairman of the Association of Austrian Social Insurances and multiple health economists have condemned these changes, saying that \"they would not centralize but decentralize and impair a perfectly functioning and effective system and thus be a general worsening for the insured\".

January 2020; he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017.\n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the [[Law school|faculty of law]] at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]], immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the youngest chancellor in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings).

While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years.
