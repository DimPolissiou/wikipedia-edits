Chace had previously worked for [[Samuel Slater]], the founder of the first successful textile mill in America. Chace founded his first textile mill in 1806. In 1929, the Valley Falls Company merged with the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company established in 1889, in [[Adams, Massachusetts]].

At this time, Hathaway was run by [[Seabury Stanton]], whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120&nbsp;million in revenue, and was headquartered in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\n\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve.{{Vague|date=January 2020}} In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11{{frac|1|2}} per share for the company to buy back Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11{{frac|3|8}}.

However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now the majority owner of a textile business that was failing.\n\nBuffett initially maintained Berkshire's core business of textiles, but by 1967, he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments. Berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of [[National Indemnity Company]]. In the late 1970s, Berkshire acquired an [[Equity (finance)|equity stake]] in the Government Employees Insurance Company ([[GEICO]]), which forms the core of its insurance operations today (and is a major source of capital for Berkshire Hathaway's other investments). In 1985, the last textile operations (Hathaway's historic core) were shut down.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200&nbsp;billion over the subsequent 45 years.<ref name=\"cnbc.com\"/> Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884|title=CNBC Transcript: Warren Buffett's $200B Berkshire Blunder and the Valuable Lesson He Learned|publisher=CNBC|date=October 18, 2010|author=Alex Crippen|accessdate=September 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000257/https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884|archive-date=September 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate affairs==\n\nBerkshire's [[class A share]]s sold for $339,188 as of January 8, 2020 making them the highest-priced shares on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], in part because they have never had a [[stock split]] and have only paid a [[dividend]] once since Warren Buffett took over, retaining corporate earnings on its balance sheet in a manner that is impermissible for [[mutual fund]]s.

At this time, Hathaway was run by [[Seabury Stanton]], whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120&nbsp;million in revenue, and was headquartered in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\n\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve.{{Vague|date=January 2020}} In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11{{frac|1|2}} per share for the company to buy back Buffett's shares.

However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now the majority owner of a textile business that was failing.\n\nBuffett initially maintained Berkshire's core business of textiles, but by 1967, he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments. Berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of [[National Indemnity Company]]. In the late 1970s, Berkshire acquired an [[Equity (finance)|equity stake]] in the Government Employees Insurance Company ([[GEICO]]), which forms the core of its insurance operations today (and is a major source of capital for Berkshire Hathaway's other investments).

Pioneering, influential, or otherwise significant artists include [[the Beach Boys]] (''[[Smiley Smile]]''), [[R.

At various points since the 1980s, \"lo-fi\" has been connoted with [[cassette culture]], the [[DIY culture|DIY ethos]] of punk, [[indie rock]], [[Na\u00efve art|primitivism]], [[outsider music]], [[authenticity in art|authenticity]], [[slacker]]/[[Generation X]] stereotypes, and cultural [[nostalgia]]. The notion of \"bedroom\" musicians expanded following the rise of modern [[digital audio workstation]]s, and in the late 2000s, lo-fi aesthetics served as the basis of the [[chillwave]] and [[hypnagogic pop]] music genres.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Definitions and etymology==\n{{Quote box\n | quote = At its most crudely sketched, lo-fi was primitivist and realist in the 1980s, postmodern in the 1990s, and archaicist in the 2000s.\n | source = \u2014Adam Harper, '' Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse'' (2014){{sfn|Harper|2014|p=5}}\n | align = right\n | width = 25em\n |}}\n\nLo-fi is the opposite of [[hi-fi]].<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\" /> Historically, the prescriptions of \"lo-fi\" have been relative to technological advances and the expectations of ordinary music listeners, causing the rhetoric and discourse surrounding the term to shift numerous times.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=4\u20137}} Usually spelled as \"low-fi\" before the 1990s, the term has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of \"high fidelity\", and its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', lo-fi was added under the definition of \"sound production less good in quality than 'hi-fi'\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=7, 11}} Music educator [[R. Murray Schafer]], in the glossary for his 1977 book ''The Tuning of the World'', defined the term as \"unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=9}}\n\nThere was virtually no appreciation for the imperfections of lo-fi music among critics until the 1980s, during which there was an emergent romanticism for [[home recording|home-recording]] and \"[[do-it-yourself]]\" (DIY) qualities.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=3\u20134, 10}} Afterward, \"DIY\" was often used interchangeably with \"lo-fi\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=44, 117}}  By the end of the 1980s, qualities such as \"home-recorded\", \"technically primitive\", and \"inexpensive equipment\" were commonly associated with the \"lo-fi\" label, and throughout the 1990s, such ideas became central to how \"lo-fi\" was popularly understood.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=11}} Consequently, in 2003, the ''Oxford Dictionary'' added a second definition for the term\u2014\"a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound\".

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...  Hypothetically, at least, lo-fi effects are created during recording and production itself, and perceptibly remain in master recordings that are then identically copied for release.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=16}}\n\nBruce Bartlett, in his 2013 guide ''Practical Recording Techniques'', states that \"lo-fi sounds might have a narrow frequency response (a thin, cheap sound), and might include noise such as hiss or record scratches.

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...

Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, have no minimum or maximum.\n\n==Definition==\nA real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' defined on a [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''maximum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. Similarly, the function has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''minimum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the '''maximum value''' of the function and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the '''minimum value''' of the function. Symbolically, this can be written as follows:\n:<math>x_0 \\in \\mathrm{X}</math> is a global maximum point of function <math>f:\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> if  <math>(\\forall x \\in \\mathrm{X})\\, f(x_0) \\geq f(x).</math>\nSimilarly for global minimum point.\n\nIf the domain ''X'' is a [[metric space]] then ''f'' is said to have a '''local''' (or '''relative''') '''maximum point''' at the point ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if there exists some ''&epsilon;'' > 0 such that ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>. Similarly, the function has a '''local minimum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>. A similar definition can be used when ''X'' is a [[topological space]], since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:\n:Let <math>(\\mathrm{X}, d_\\mathrm{X})</math> be a metric space and function <math> f:\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>. Then <math>x_0 \\in \\mathrm{X}</math> is a local maximum point of function <math>f</math>  if <math> (\\exists \\varepsilon > 0)</math> such that <math>(\\forall x \\in \\mathrm{X})\\, d_\\mathrm{X}(x, x_0)<\\varepsilon \\implies f(x_0)\\geq f(x).</math>\n\nSimilarly for a local minimum point.\n\nIn both the global and local cases, the concept of a '''strict''' extremum can be defined. For example, ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> is a '''strict global maximum point''' if, for all ''x'' in ''X'' with ''x'' \u2260 ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>, we have ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) > ''f''(''x''), and ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> is a '''strict local maximum point''' if there exists some ''&epsilon;'' > 0 such that, for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> with ''x'' \u2260 ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>, we have ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) > ''f''(''x''). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.\n\nA [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function with a [[Compact space|compact]] domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed (and bounded) [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s (see the graph above).\n\n==Search==\nFinding global maxima and minima is the goal of [[mathematical optimization]]. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the [[extreme value theorem]] global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one.\n\nLikely the most important, yet quite obvious, feature of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[Real-valued function|real-valued]] functions of [[Function of a real variable|a real variable]] is that they [[Decreasing function|decrease]] before local minima and [[Increasing function|increase]] afterwards, likewise for maxima. (Formally, if ''f'' is continuous real-valued function of a real variable ''x'' then ''x<sub>0</sub>'' is a local minimum [[If and only if|iff]] there exist ''a<x<sub>0</sub><b'' such that ''f'' decreases on ''(a,x<sub>0</sub>)'' and increases on ''(x<sub>0</sub>,b)'')<ref>{{Cite book|title=Problems in mathematical analysis|date=1964|publisher=Moskva|others=Demidov\u01d0c, Boris P., Baranenkov, G.|isbn=0846407612|location=Moscow(IS)|oclc=799468131}}</ref> A direct consequence of this is the [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], which states that local extrema must occur at [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s. One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the [[first derivative test]], [[derivative test#Second derivative test (single variable)|second derivative test]], or [[higher-order derivative test]], given sufficient differentiability.\n\nFor any function that is defined [[piecewise]], one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:xth root of x.svg|thumb|right|The global maximum of <math>\\sqrt[x]{x}</math> occurs at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.]]\n* The function ''x''<sup>2</sup> has a unique global minimum at ''x'' = 0.\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup> has no global minima or maxima.  Although the first derivative (3''x''<sup>2</sup>) is 0 at ''x'' = 0, this is an [[inflection point]].\n* The function <math>\\sqrt[x]{x}</math> has a unique global maximum at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''. (See figure at right)\n* The function x<sup>\u2212x</sup> has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at ''x'' = 1/''e''.\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup>/3 \u2212 ''x'' has first derivative ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1 and [[second derivative]] 2''x''.  Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for ''x'' gives stationary points at \u22121 and +1.  From the sign of the second derivative we can see that \u22121 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum.  Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum.\n* The function |''x''| has a global minimum at ''x'' = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at ''x'' = 0.\n* The function cos(''x'') has infinitely many global maxima at 0, \u00b12{{pi}}, \u00b14{{pi}}, ..., and infinitely many global minima at \u00b1&pi;, \u00b13&pi;, \u00b15&pi;, ....\n* The function 2 cos(''x'') \u2212 ''x'' has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum.\n* The function cos(3{{pi}}''x'')/''x'' with 0.1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;1.1 has a global maximum at ''x''&nbsp;= 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near ''x''&nbsp;= 0.3, a local maximum near ''x''&nbsp;= 0.6, and a local minimum near ''x''&nbsp;= 1.0. (See figure at top of page.)\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup> + 3''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''x'' + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [\u22124,2] has a local maximum at ''x'' = \u22121\u2212{{radic|15}}/3, a local minimum at ''x'' = \u22121+{{radic|15}}/3, a global maximum at ''x'' = 2 and a global minimum at ''x'' = \u22124.\n\n==Functions of more than one variable==<!-- This section is linked from [[Indifference curve]] -->\n{{main|Second partial derivative test}}\n[[File:Modell einer Peanoschen Fl\u00e4che -Schilling XLIX, 1-.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peano surface]], a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th century]][[File:MaximumParaboloid.png|thumb|right|The global maximum is the point at the top]]\n[[File:MaximumCounterexample.png|thumb|right|Counterexample: The red dot shows a local minimum that is not a global minimum]]\nFor functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure at the right, the necessary conditions for a ''local'' maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first [[partial derivatives]] as to  ''z'' (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative.  These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum because of the possibility of a [[saddle point]]. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function ''z'' must also be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] throughout. The [[second partial derivative test]] can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.\nIn contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function ''f'' defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the [[intermediate value theorem]] and [[Rolle's theorem]] to prove this by [[reductio ad absurdum]]). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails, as the function\n:<math>f(x,y)= x^2+y^2(1-x)^3,\\qquad x,y\\in\\mathbb{R},</math>\nshows. Its only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with \u0192(0,0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. However, it cannot be a global one, because \u0192(2,3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22125.\n\n==Maxima or minima of a functional==\nIf the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions, i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]], the extremum is found using the [[calculus of variations]].\n\n==In relation to sets==\nMaxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an [[ordered set]] ''S'' has a [[greatest element]] ''m'', ''m'' is a [[maximal element]]. Furthermore, if ''S'' is a subset of an ordered set ''T'' and ''m'' is the greatest element of ''S'' with respect to order induced by ''T'', ''m'' is a [[supremum|least upper bound]] of ''S'' in ''T''. The similar result holds for [[least element]], [[minimal element]] and [[infimum|greatest lower bound]]. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in [[database]]s, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-[[decomposable aggregation function]]s.\n\nIn the case of a general [[partial order]], the '''least element''' (smaller than all other) should not be confused with a '''minimal element''' (nothing is smaller).  Likewise, a '''[[greatest element]]''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is an [[upper bound]] of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a '''maximal element''' ''m'' of a poset ''A'' is an element of ''A'' such that if ''m'' \u2264 ''b'' (for any ''b'' in ''A'') then ''m'' = ''b''. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.\n\nIn a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, or ''chain'', all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set we can simply use the terms '''''minimum''''' and '''''maximum'''''. If a chain is finite then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of [[natural number]]s has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain ''S'' is bounded, then the [[topological closure|closure]] ''Cl(S)'' of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in such case they are called the '''greatest lower bound''' and the '''least upper bound''' of the set ''S'', respectively.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Derivative test]]\n*[[Infimum and supremum]]\n*[[Limit superior and limit inferior]]\n*[[Mechanical equilibrium]]\n*[[Sample maximum and minimum]]\n*[[Saddle point]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Extrema (calculus)}}\n{{Wiktionary|maxima|minima|extremum}}\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/MaximaandMinima.html Maxima and Minima] From MathWorld\u2014A Wolfram Web Resource.\n*[http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/thomas-simpson-and-maxima-and-minima Thomas Simpson's work on Maxima and Minima] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713083148/http://mathdl.maa.org/convergence/1/ Convergence]\n*[http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/differential-calculus/application-of-maxima-and-minima Application of Maxima and Minima with sub pages of solved problems]\n\n[[Category:Calculus]]\n[[Category:Mathematical analysis]]\n[[Category:Mathematical optimization]]\n[[Category:Superlatives]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Largest and smallest value taken by a function takes at a given point}}\n{{For|use in statistics|Sample maximum and minimum}}\n{{redirect|Extreme value|the concept in statistics|Extreme value theory|the concept in calculus|Extreme value theorem}}\n{{redirect-multi|2|Maximum|Minimum}}\n[[File:Extrema example original.svg|thumb|Local and global maxima and minima for cos(3&pi;''x'')/''x'', 0.1&le;'' x ''&le;1.1]]\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], the '''maxima and minima''' (the respective plurals of '''maximum''' and '''minimum''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], known collectively as '''extrema''' (the plural of '''extremum'''), are the largest and smallest value of the function, either within a given range (the '''local''' or '''relative''' extrema) or on the entire [[domain of a function]] (the '''global''' or '''absolute''' extrema).<ref>{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-495-01166-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/calculusearlytra00stew_1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-547-16702-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Thomas | first1 = George B. | last2=Weir | first2= Maurice D. | last3=Hass | first3=Joel |author3-link = Joel Hass| authorlink=George B.

Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, have no minimum or maximum.\n\n==Definition==\nA real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' defined on a [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''maximum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. Similarly, the function has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''minimum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the '''maximum value''' of the function and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the '''minimum value''' of the function. Symbolically, this can be written as follows:\n:<math>x_0 \\in \\mathrm{X}</math> is a global maximum point of function <math>f:\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> if  <math>(\\forall x \\in \\mathrm{X})\\, f(x_0) \\geq f(x).</math>\nSimilarly for global minimum point.\n\nIf the domain ''X'' is a [[metric space]] then ''f'' is said to have a '''local''' (or '''relative''') '''maximum point''' at the point ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if there exists some ''&epsilon;'' > 0 such that ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>. Similarly, the function has a '''local minimum point''' at ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> if ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) &le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>. A similar definition can be used when ''X'' is a [[topological space]], since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:\n:Let <math>(\\mathrm{X}, d_\\mathrm{X})</math> be a metric space and function <math> f:\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>. Then <math>x_0 \\in \\mathrm{X}</math> is a local maximum point of function <math>f</math>  if <math> (\\exists \\varepsilon > 0)</math> such that <math>(\\forall x \\in \\mathrm{X})\\, d_\\mathrm{X}(x, x_0)<\\varepsilon \\implies f(x_0)\\geq f(x).</math>\n\nSimilarly for a local minimum point.\n\nIn both the global and local cases, the concept of a '''strict''' extremum can be defined. For example, ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> is a '''strict global maximum point''' if, for all ''x'' in ''X'' with ''x'' \u2260 ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>, we have ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) > ''f''(''x''), and ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> is a '''strict local maximum point''' if there exists some ''&epsilon;'' > 0 such that, for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&epsilon;'' of ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup> with ''x'' \u2260 ''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>, we have ''f''(''x''<sup>&lowast;</sup>) > ''f''(''x''). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.\n\nA [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function with a [[Compact space|compact]] domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed (and bounded) [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s (see the graph above).\n\n==Search==\nFinding global maxima and minima is the goal of [[mathematical optimization]]. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the [[extreme value theorem]] global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one.\n\nLikely the most important, yet quite obvious, feature of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[Real-valued function|real-valued]] functions of [[Function of a real variable|a real variable]] is that they [[Decreasing function|decrease]] before local minima and [[Increasing function|increase]] afterwards, likewise for maxima. (Formally, if ''f'' is continuous real-valued function of a real variable ''x'' then ''x<sub>0</sub>'' is a local minimum [[If and only if|iff]] there exist ''a<x<sub>0</sub><b'' such that ''f'' decreases on ''(a,x<sub>0</sub>)'' and increases on ''(x<sub>0</sub>,b)'')<ref>{{Cite book|title=Problems in mathematical analysis|date=1964|publisher=Moskva|others=Demidov\u01d0c, Boris P., Baranenkov, G.|isbn=0846407612|location=Moscow(IS)|oclc=799468131}}</ref> A direct consequence of this is the [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], which states that local extrema must occur at [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s. One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the [[first derivative test]], [[derivative test#Second derivative test (single variable)|second derivative test]], or [[higher-order derivative test]], given sufficient differentiability.\n\nFor any function that is defined [[piecewise]], one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:xth root of x.svg|thumb|right|The global maximum of <math>\\sqrt[x]{x}</math> occurs at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.]]\n* The function ''x''<sup>2</sup> has a unique global minimum at ''x'' = 0.\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup> has no global minima or maxima.  Although the first derivative (3''x''<sup>2</sup>) is 0 at ''x'' = 0, this is an [[inflection point]].\n* The function <math>\\sqrt[x]{x}</math> has a unique global maximum at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''. (See figure at right)\n* The function x<sup>\u2212x</sup> has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at ''x'' = 1/''e''.\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup>/3 \u2212 ''x'' has first derivative ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1 and [[second derivative]] 2''x''.  Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for ''x'' gives stationary points at \u22121 and +1.  From the sign of the second derivative we can see that \u22121 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum.  Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum.\n* The function |''x''| has a global minimum at ''x'' = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at ''x'' = 0.\n* The function cos(''x'') has infinitely many global maxima at 0, \u00b12{{pi}}, \u00b14{{pi}}, ..., and infinitely many global minima at \u00b1&pi;, \u00b13&pi;, \u00b15&pi;, ....\n* The function 2 cos(''x'') \u2212 ''x'' has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum.\n* The function cos(3{{pi}}''x'')/''x'' with 0.1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;1.1 has a global maximum at ''x''&nbsp;= 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near ''x''&nbsp;= 0.3, a local maximum near ''x''&nbsp;= 0.6, and a local minimum near ''x''&nbsp;= 1.0. (See figure at top of page.)\n* The function ''x''<sup>3</sup> + 3''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''x'' + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [\u22124,2] has a local maximum at ''x'' = \u22121\u2212{{radic|15}}/3, a local minimum at ''x'' = \u22121+{{radic|15}}/3, a global maximum at ''x'' = 2 and a global minimum at ''x'' = \u22124.\n\n==Functions of more than one variable==<!-- This section is linked from [[Indifference curve]] -->\n{{main|Second partial derivative test}}\n[[File:Modell einer Peanoschen Fl\u00e4che -Schilling XLIX, 1-.jpg|thumb|[[Peano surface]], a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th century]]\nFor functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure at the right, the necessary conditions for a ''local'' maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first [[partial derivatives]] as to  ''z'' (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative.  These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum because of the possibility of a [[saddle point]]. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function ''z'' must also be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] throughout. The [[second partial derivative test]] can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.\nIn contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function ''f'' defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the [[intermediate value theorem]] and [[Rolle's theorem]] to prove this by [[reductio ad absurdum]]). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails, as the function\n:<math>f(x,y)= x^2+y^2(1-x)^3,\\qquad x,y\\in\\mathbb{R},</math>\nshows. Its only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with \u0192(0,0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. However, it cannot be a global one, because \u0192(2,3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22125.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Multivariate functions\n|File:MaximumParaboloid.png\n |The global maximum is the point at the top\n|File:MaximumCounterexample.png\n |Counterexample: The red dot shows a local minimum that is not a global minimum\n}}\n\n==Maxima or minima of a functional==\nIf the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions, i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]], the extremum is found using the [[calculus of variations]].\n\n==In relation to sets==\nMaxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an [[ordered set]] ''S'' has a [[greatest element]] ''m'', ''m'' is a [[maximal element]]. Furthermore, if ''S'' is a subset of an ordered set ''T'' and ''m'' is the greatest element of ''S'' with respect to order induced by ''T'', ''m'' is a [[supremum|least upper bound]] of ''S'' in ''T''. The similar result holds for [[least element]], [[minimal element]] and [[infimum|greatest lower bound]]. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in [[database]]s, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-[[decomposable aggregation function]]s.\n\nIn the case of a general [[partial order]], the '''least element''' (smaller than all other) should not be confused with a '''minimal element''' (nothing is smaller).

[[Lithuania]] in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] competition and are governed by the [[Lithuanian Tennis Association]].\n\nLithuania has never been a tennis country \u2013 no tennis player from Lithuania entered [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] top 500 until 2008. However, the situation is changing in recent years. Currently young Lithuanian players are winning the greatest tennis victories in the history of Lithuania. As expected, this led to the increasing popularity of tennis in the country.

The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that\n{{quote|My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.<ref name=Roux />}}\n\nLater claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an \"entu\" priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a pedigree of nobility, since only a highly placed family could achieve such a position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

The royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position, close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sargon|doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e1101500}}</ref> This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\n\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down.

Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.\n\nInitially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' =Great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ''\"\u00e9\"'' (= house) or \"palace\", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.\n\nAs Sargon extended his conquest from the \"Lower Sea\" (Persian Gulf), to the \"Upper Sea\" (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled \"the totality of the lands under heaven\", or \"from sunrise to sunset\", as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' became recognised as meaning \"lord of the universe\". Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrain]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history.  Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.\n\nWith Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called \"Lord of the Four-Quarters (of the Earth)\", but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.<ref>Leick, Gwendolyn (2001) \"Mesopotamia: Invention of the City\" (Penguin Books)</ref>\n\nOne strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.<ref>[http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in of Pots and Plans.

Before the Akkadian period the progressive [[soil salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and [[demography|demographic pressures]] were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.<ref>Thompson, William J. (2003), \"Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation,\" ''Journal of World Systems Research''</ref> It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.\n\n[[File:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|thumb|left|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, {{circa|lk=no|2270}} BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]]\nThe [[water table]] in this region was very high and replenished regularly\u2014by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October\u2014a period of food shortage\u2014under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has<ref>Leick Gwendolyn (2003), \"Mesopotamia: The invention of the city\" (Penguin)</ref> suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, \"Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival\u20145,400 warriors ate bread daily before him\".<ref>Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch. \"The institutions of urbanism\", 1990:179.</ref>\n\nHarvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. [[Nomad]]ic [[Amorites]] from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the [[crop residue]] and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in [[wool]], [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[cheese]] to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Stephen|title=The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed|date=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=9780500251478|page=89}}</ref> and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.\n\n===Foreign trade===\n[[File:Moyen_Orient_3mil_aC.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Location of foreign lands for the Mesopotamians, including [[Elam]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Dilmun]], [[Marhashi]] and [[Meluhha]].]]\n{{see also|Indus-Mesopotamia relations}}\nAs a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the \"silver mountain\" (possibly the [[Taurus Mountains]]), the \"cedars\" of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of Magan, was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports.

It is probable that the first collection of [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest \"year names\", whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from Sargon's reign.

The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that\n{{quote|My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.<ref name=Roux />}}\n\nLater claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an \"entu\" priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a pedigree of nobility, since only a highly placed family could achieve such a position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

The royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position, close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sargon|doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e1101500}}</ref> This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\n\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down.

Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.\n\nInitially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' =Great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ''\"\u00e9\"'' (= house) or \"palace\", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.\n\nAs Sargon extended his conquest from the \"Lower Sea\" (Persian Gulf), to the \"Upper Sea\" (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled \"the totality of the lands under heaven\", or \"from sunrise to sunset\", as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' became recognised as meaning \"lord of the universe\". Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrain]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history.  Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.\n\nWith Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called \"Lord of the Four-Quarters (of the Earth)\", but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.<ref>Leick, Gwendolyn (2001) \"Mesopotamia: Invention of the City\" (Penguin Books)</ref>\n\nOne strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.<ref>[http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in of Pots and Plans.

Before the Akkadian period the progressive [[soil salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and [[demography|demographic pressures]] were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.<ref>Thompson, William J. (2003), \"Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation,\" ''Journal of World Systems Research''</ref> It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.\n\n[[File:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|thumb|left|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, {{circa|lk=no|2270}} BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]]\nThe [[water table]] in this region was very high and replenished regularly\u2014by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October\u2014a period of food shortage\u2014under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has<ref>Leick Gwendolyn (2003), \"Mesopotamia: The invention of the city\" (Penguin)</ref> suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, \"Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival\u20145,400 warriors ate bread daily before him\".<ref>Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch. \"The institutions of urbanism\", 1990:179.</ref>\n\nHarvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. [[Nomad]]ic [[Amorites]] from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the [[crop residue]] and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in [[wool]], [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[cheese]] to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Stephen|title=The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed|date=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=9780500251478|page=89}}</ref> and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.\n\n===Foreign trade===\n[[File:Moyen_Orient_3mil_aC.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Location of foreign lands for the Mesopotamians, including [[Elam]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Dilmun]], [[Marhashi]] and [[Meluhha]].]]\n{{see also|Indus-Mesopotamia relations}}\nAs a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported.

It is probable that the first collection of [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon.

{"title_page": "Peter Gadol", "text_new": "'''Peter Gadol''' is an American author. Gadol was born on April 15, 1964 and grew up in [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]], [[New Jersey]].  He received an A.B. ''magna cum laude'' in English and American Literature from [[Harvard College]] in 1986.  While at Harvard, he studied writing with [[Seamus Heaney]], wrote a thesis on [[Wallace Stevens]] under the supervision of [[Helen Vendler]], edited the literary magazine ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and was for two years a fiction intern at ''[[The Atlantic]]''.\n\nGadol is the author of six books. His debut novel, ''Coyote'', published by Crown in 1990, was hailed by ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]'' as \"the work of an energetic mind, one seemingly unfettered by fashionable norms,\" and his second novel, ''The Mystery Roast'' (Crown, 1993), was described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as \"a savory spoof of trends, but ultimately...a love story involving secrets and dreams, anxieties about fulfillment and intimacy and the [[Muses]] that inspire us nonetheless.\"\n\n''Closer to the Sun'', published by Picador USA in 1996, was inspired by Gadol's move to [[Los Angeles]] and tells the story of a young couple who, after having lost their home in a [[canyon]] wildfire, enlist the help of a drifter to rebuild the house themselves, the drifter himself overcoming the loss of a lover to [[AIDS]].\n\nIn ''The Long Rain'' (Picador USA, 1997), Gadol returned to [[California]], this time [[wine]] country, to write a literary thriller about a lawyer who defends a man wrongly accused of committing a crime the lawyer himself committed. The novel was translated into several languages and nominated for a prize from PEN West.\n\n''Light at Dusk'' (Picador USA, 2000), is set in the [[Paris]] of a slightly near-future in which the [[far right]] has ascended and [[white power skinhead]] [[gang]]s freely roam the streets. The daylight abduction of a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] boy causes a young American ex-diplomat to re-enter the morally questionable world he abandoned in order to find the child.  The ''[[LA Weekly]]'' applauded the novel for its \"elegant, but mannered prose; tight, suspenseful plotting; moody Parisian setting; fearlessly high-modernist concerns,\" and claimed the novel \"will not look out of place slouching on the shelf somewhere between [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Graham Greene]].\"\n\nGadol's sixth novel ''Silver Lake'' was published by [[Tyrus Books]] in September 2009. ''Silver Lake'' is about two architects, two men turning forty who have been involved professionally and personally for twenty years, and who are beginning to see their practice and their marriage falter.  One day, a peculiar young man drifts into their storefront office claiming he has car trouble, asking to use the phone.  The men get to talking; the young stranger is curious but enchanting, and one of the architects ends up playing tennis with him that afternoon, ultimately inviting him home for dinner.  The ensuing evening involves a lot of wine and banter and then increasingly dark conversation, and when the stranger has had too much to drink, the two men insist he sleep in their guest room.

Gadol was born on April 15, 1964 and grew up in [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]], [[New Jersey]].  He received an A.B. ''magna cum laude'' in English and American Literature from [[Harvard College]] in 1986.  While at Harvard, he studied writing with [[Seamus Heaney]], wrote a thesis on [[Wallace Stevens]] under the supervision of [[Helen Vendler]], edited the literary magazine ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and was for two years a fiction intern at ''[[The Atlantic]]''.\n\nGadol is the author of six books. His debut novel, ''Coyote'', published by Crown in 1990, was hailed by ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]'' as \"the work of an energetic mind, one seemingly unfettered by fashionable norms,\" and his second novel, ''The Mystery Roast'' (Crown, 1993), was described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as \"a savory spoof of trends, but ultimately...a love story involving secrets and dreams, anxieties about fulfillment and intimacy and the [[Muses]] that inspire us nonetheless.\"\n\n''Closer to the Sun'', published by Picador USA in 1996, was inspired by Gadol's move to [[Los Angeles]] and tells the story of a young couple who, after having lost their home in a [[canyon]] wildfire, enlist the help of a drifter to rebuild the house themselves, the drifter himself overcoming the loss of a lover to [[AIDS]].\n\nIn ''The Long Rain'' (Picador USA, 1997), Gadol returned to [[California]], this time [[wine]] country, to write a literary thriller about a lawyer who defends a man wrongly accused of committing a crime the lawyer himself committed. The novel was translated into several languages and nominated for a prize from PEN West.\n\n''Light at Dusk'' (Picador USA, 2000), is set in the [[Paris]] of a slightly near-future in which the [[far right]] has ascended and [[white power skinhead]] [[gang]]s freely roam the streets. The daylight abduction of a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] boy causes a young American ex-diplomat to re-enter the morally questionable world he abandoned in order to find the child.  The ''[[LA Weekly]]'' applauded the novel for its \"elegant, but mannered prose; tight, suspenseful plotting; moody Parisian setting; fearlessly high-modernist concerns,\" and claimed the novel \"will not look out of place slouching on the shelf somewhere between [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Graham Greene]].\"\n\nGadol's sixth novel ''Silver Lake'' was published by [[Tyrus Books]] in September 2009. ''Silver Lake'' is about two architects, two men turning forty who have been involved professionally and personally for twenty years, and who are beginning to see their practice and their marriage falter.  One day, a peculiar young man drifts into their storefront office claiming he has car trouble, asking to use the phone.  The men get to talking; the young stranger is curious but enchanting, and one of the architects ends up playing tennis with him that afternoon, ultimately inviting him home for dinner.  The ensuing evening involves a lot of wine and banter and then increasingly dark conversation, and when the stranger has had too much to drink, the two men insist he sleep in their guest room.  During the night, the stranger commits an act of violence which shatters the architects' ordered lives, each man in his own way over the days and months that follow coping with blossoming doubt and corrosive secrets.  The reviewer for ''Booklist'' wrote: \"In his trademark crystalline prose, reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith, Gadol vividly illustrates the universal themes of the stranger who comes to town, the quest for redemption, and the entanglement of deception.\" ''Silver Lake'' was nominated for awards from the Southern California Independent Booksellers Association and Lambda Literary.\n\n''The Stranger Game'', a novel about a woman who is drawn into a dangerous game following random strangers, was published on October 2, 2018 by Hanover Square Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.
