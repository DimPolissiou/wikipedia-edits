Together, they developed the first written concept of operations for this team, a table of allowances, and a plan of action for formalizing the CCATT program. The first table of allowances was developed on a Saturday, in an empty ICU room, by Drs. Johannigman and Farmer. They gathered various supplies, equipment, medical devices, and medications in this room. They agreed that this team should be able to care for 3 patients. Through the day, they bartered, added, and subtracted\u2014ultimately limiting the supplies to a single grocery-sized cart. This became the first CCATT table of allowances.\n\nDrs.

In addition to these several deployments from 1994\u20131996, there were numerous field exercises with various Air [[Medical evacuation|Evac]] units in [[CONUS]] and [[OCONUS]] as the UTC was further refined.

{"title_page": "Chris Sugden", "text_new": "'''Chris Sugden''' is a [[Norfolk]] humorist, best known for his portrayal of fictional folk singer '''Sid Kipper''', the younger half of [[the Kipper Family]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\nBorn in [[West Runton]] in 1952, Sugden initially studied pharmacy at [[Leicester Polytechnic]] before starting a PhD at the [[University of East Anglia]]. He is the author of ''Prewd and Prejudice'' (1994) in which the heroine Miriam Prewd spends a traumatic year of \u2018Norfolk exile\u2019. Written in his characteristic dead-pan style ''Prewd and Prejudice'' concerns itself with the Norfolk countryside, misconceptions about Norfolk and its self-deprecating folk. Sugden wrote that \"the national papers seemed to think that it took the mickey out of country people, while the Norfolk people thought it ridiculed Londoners\".\n\nSugden is also the author of ''The Cromer-Sheringham Crab Wars'' and the song ''Like a Rhinestone Ploughboy''. He is the compiler of an (as yet) unpublished rhyming dictionary of Norfolk place-names for song-writing purposes.
