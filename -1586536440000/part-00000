The dry and rocky island had a population of 1,350 in 2005 and has an area of {{convert|348|km2|sqmi}} which includes the area of several small nearby islands.

Cedros has a distinctive flora and the traces of some of the earliest human beings in the [[New World]]. The ocean around the island is popular with sport fishermen.\n\nThere was human presence of the island already about 11,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|American Indian]] inhabitants when the island was first visited by Spanish explorers in the 16th century called it Huamalgua, the \"Island of Fogs.\"  The Indian inhabitants have been given the name Huamalgue\u00f1os by modern day scholars. They were relocated to the mainland of Baja California by [[Jesuit]] missionaries in 1732 and ceased to exist as an identifiable people.<ref>Des Lauriers, Mathew R.

The [[Islas San Benito]], about {{cvt|25|km|0}} west and {{convert|3.899|km2|3|abbr=on}} in area, are administratively part of Cedros Island.\n\nThe ''Isla de Cedros'' was named by early Spanish explorers who mistakenly associated the large amounts of [[Coast redwood|redwood]] and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] [[driftwood]] arriving with the California current for local [[pine]]s visible on the crest of the island.\n\n==Climate==\nCedros Island has a desert climate, BWh in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system and BWab (desert, hot summers, warm winters) in the [[Trewartha climate classification]].\n{{Weather box\n|location = Isla Cedros {{convert|10|m|ft}} above sea level {{coord|28|08|N|115|10|W|display=inline}}  \n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes \n|Jan mean F = 65.5\n|Feb mean F = 66.4\n|Mar mean F = 66.6\n|Apr mean F = 68.9\n|May mean F = 69.8\n|Jun mean F = 71.1\n|Jul mean F = 75.2\n|Aug mean F = 76.8\n|Sep mean F = 77.0\n|Oct mean F = 74.8 \n|Nov mean F = 70.5\n|Dec mean F = 66.2\n|year mean F = 70.7  \n|Jan high F = 73.0\n|Feb high F = 74.1\n|Mar high F = 74.5\n|Apr high F = 77.5\n|May high F = 78.3\n|Jun high F = 79.2\n|Jul high F = 83.5\n|Aug high F = 84.9\n|Sep high F = 85.1\n|Oct high F = 83.5\n|Nov high F = 78.3\n|Dec high F = 73.8\n|year high F = 78.8\n|Jan low F = 57.7\n|Feb low F = 58.5\n|Mar low F = 58.5\n|Apr low F = 60.3\n|May low F = 61.3\n|Jun low F = 63.1\n|Jul low F = 66.9\n|Aug low F = 68.9\n|Sep low F = 68.9\n|Oct low F = 66.4\n|Nov low F = 62.6\n|Dec low F = 59.2\n|year low F = 62.8 \n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.4\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.4\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.1\n|May precipitation inch = 0\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.1\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.4\n|year precipitation inch = 2.1\n|source 1 = <ref>\"Isla Cedros, Baja California\", ''Weatherbase'', https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=982027&cityname=Isla+Cedros%2C+Baja+California%2C+Mexico, accessed 20 Jun 2018</ref>  \n}}\n\nThe only weather station on the island is located on the southeastern coast.  The northern and western parts of the island are several degrees cooler because the cold waters surrounding the island cause heavy fog and clouds, especially during spring and summer.  The condensation from the fog permits lusher vegetation to flourish, similar to the \"fog oases\" ([[lomas]]) of the arid Pacific Coast of [[South America]].  Precipitation is also greater at the higher elevations of the island, reaching possible annual totals of {{convert|200|mm|inch}}. Rarely, heavy rains caused by unstable tropical air masses and [[chubasco]]s cause flooding.<ref>Oberbauer, Thomas A.

The 2005 census<ref>INEGI (2007)</ref> showed a total population of 1,350 persons.\n\nThe [[Boroughs of Mexico|borough]] \"seat\" is Cedros town (\"Pueblo Cedros\"), on the southern east coast. Pueblo Cedros is largely associated with ''Pescadores Nacionales de Abul\u00f3n'', the [[lobster]] and [[abalone]] fishing [[cooperative]] based on the island. It was founded by fishermen in 1922.\n\nThe second town is Puerto Morro Redondo (in short, El Morro), close to the southeastern point of the island, El Morro. It is a \"company town,\" built by the joint [[Mexican Government]] and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] to house the workers of the salt-[[transshipment]] facility on the island. Salt from the [[salt evaporation pond]]s of [[Guerrero Negro]] on the [[Baja California peninsula]] is taken by barge to a deepwater salt dock near Puerto Morro Redondo, at the south end of Cedros Island, where it is loaded onto ships for export. There is regularly scheduled air service to the island from Ensenada, departing every Monday and Wednesday, and landing at [[Isla de Cedros Airport|an airstrip]] at the south end, adjacent to the \"company town,\" while a {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} road leads to \"Pueblo Cedros\". Open launch rides across the channel between Cedros and the mainland can also be arranged at the Abarrotes Ramales store in Bahia Tortugas, but travellers opting for this transport should be prepared to have a flexible schedule with several extra days in case of inclement weather conditions in the Channel.\n\nThe remaining settlements are smaller. Jerusalem is just west of El Morro, but on the western side of the airport, with regularly arranged residential units. It is frequently considered part of El Morro.\n\nLomas Blancas, a mining town with 17 buildings, is located between Cedros town and El Morro.\n\nSan Agust\u00edn, a typical fishing village with about 20 buildings, is located {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} northeast of the southwestern point of the island, Cabo San Agust\u00edn.\n\nLa Colorada, on the southwest coast, with about 10 buildings, is {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north of San Agust\u00edn.\n\nWayle, 15 buildings on the western side of the southern bight ''Bah\u00eda del Sur'', is {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} northeast of San Agust\u00edn.\n\nThe mining town of Punta Norte (about 25 buildings) is located on the northeast coast, {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=on}} southeast of the northern end of the island, which is also called Punta Norte. {{convert|2|km|0|spell=In|abbr=out}} to the southeast is Los Crestones mine.\n\nList of settlements and locations:\n#Isla de Cedros, {{coord|28|05|45.5|N|115|11|12.4|W}}\n#Puerto Morro Redondo, {{coord|28|02|18.6|N|115|11|12.0|W}}\n#Jerusalem, {{coord|28|02|24|N|115|11|29|W}}\n#Lomas Blancas, {{coord|28|04|44|N|115|11|07|W}}\n#San Agust\u00edn, {{coord|28|04|54.6|N|115|20|20.6|W}}\n#La Colorada, {{coord|28|07|01.2|N|115|21|07.0|W}}\n#Wayle, {{coord|28|05|34|N|115|18|47|W}}\n#Punta Norte, {{coord|28|21|15|N|115|11|39|W}}\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Hook (AM 1939.232-7).jpg|thumb|Native American shell fish hook from California.

Many scientists now believe that the earliest inhabitants arrived by boat, and findings on Cedros Island bolster that theory. The [[Clovis culture]], which began about 11,200 BCE, is the earliest universally acknowledged evidence of man in the Americas; but the remains of ancient people dating to earlier than 10,000 BCE have been found on Cedros Island.  Cedros Island was attractive to humans because of its rich marine environment and its relative abundance of water compared to most of the desert coastline of Baja California.  The early people of Cedros Island fished, gathered [[shellfish]], and hunted [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, and [[seabird]]s. Ancient spear points and shell fishhooks found on Cedros are similar to those found in a semi-circle of the Pacific coastline from [[Okinawa]] to [[Peru]].<ref>Des Lauriers, Matthew R.

The fishing village and cannery at Puerto Cedros were established in 1920.  The fishing cooperative was founded in 1943, and the deepwater salt dock at the south end of the island was built in 1966. The island was mapped in detail by Mexican and U.S. geologists during the 1970s.\n\n== Natural history ==\nCedros Island is at most some {{convert|38|km|1|abbr=out}} long in N-S direction and  {{convert|6.4|to|8|km|0|abbr=out}} wide in the northern half; the southern end is some {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=out}} wide in a NW-SE direction.<ref>DigitalGlobe ''et al.'' (2007). The measurements in Thayer & Bangs (1907) are in nautical miles.</ref> The island consists of a variety of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, including part of an ophiolite complex and high-pressure, low temperature blueschists. Most of the rocks are of Mesozoic age, though some late Cenozoic strata crop out near the town in the southeastern corner of the island. Its highest peak, Monte Cedros, has an elevation of {{convert|1205|m|0|abbr=out}}.\n\n===Flora===\nThe most common vegetation for more than 90 percent of the land on the island is desert scrub of many different species. The lower elevations, especially the south, receive very sparse rainfall.  However, the northern and western parts of the island are often shrouded in fog, and some plants have adapted to receiving moisture from fog.  The fog plus the slightly greater rainfall at higher elevations has permitted the existence of [[Monterey pine]] forests at elevations of {{convert|500|m|ft}} to {{convert|800|m|ft}} where the influence of the fog is most intense.  The pine forests are scattered and only cover 0.46 percent of the total area of the island.  The pines grow to a height of up to {{convert|10|m|ft}}.  [[California juniper]] are also found at similar altitudes, covering 0.05 percent of the land area.<ref>Oberbauer, pp. 118-120</ref>\n\nAt the highest elevations of the island, above and mixed in with the pine forests, [[chaparral]] vegetation is found.  The chaparral averages {{convert|3|m|ft}} in height and consists of several woody species including [[Quercus cedrosensis]], the Cedar Island live oak. Chaparral covers 2.4 percent of the land area of Cedar Island.<ref>Oberbauer, pp. 118-119</ref>\n\nVargas or El Aguaje de Vargas is the most important spring with a flow of 180 drums of 200 lts or 55 US gal (208 l; 46 imp gal) every 12 hours; springs on the island are usually marked by groves of palm trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fauna===\nLarge [[sea lion]] colonies are found on the rocks on the west side as well as the anchorage on the north end.\n\nThere are feral [[goat]]s on Cedros. Unlike on other islands in the region (notably [[Guadalupe Island]]), they do not seem to have had a significant impact on the island ecosystem. This would be due to the fact that Cedros is on the [[continental shelf]] close to the coast and, at least temporarily, it was connected to the mainland during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] when [[sea level]]s were lower than today. Then, and as a consequence of this, there are native to Cedros [[herbivore]]s, which on one hand compete with the goat population for food and presumably have kept it from increasing beyond [[carrying capacity]], and on the other hand forced the native plants to keep their defenses against herbivores, unlike plants on islands without [[megaherbivore]]s which tend to lack those defenses.\n\nFish are abundant around Cedros Island. [[Yellowtail amberjack#California yellowtail|California yellowtail]], a subspecies of [[yellowtail amberjack]], are very plentiful at this island because of yellowtail breed there. These fish like to live in the kelp beds of the island. Other fish, such as [[Paralabrax clathratus|calico bass]] and [[Archosargus probatocephalus|sheepshead]] are also very plentiful at this island.\n\n=== Endemism ===\nCedros Island is home to a number of [[taxa]] that are [[endemism|endemic]] to or occur in very few places outside the island.

The northern and western parts of the island are several degrees cooler because the cold waters surrounding the island cause heavy fog and clouds, especially during spring and summer.  The condensation from the fog permits lusher vegetation to flourish, similar to the \"fog oases\" ([[lomas]]) of the arid Pacific Coast of [[South America]].  Precipitation is also greater at the higher elevations of the island, reaching possible annual totals of {{convert|200|mm|inch}}. Rarely, heavy rains caused by unstable tropical air masses and [[chubasco]]s cause flooding.<ref>Oberbauer, Thomas A.

The 2005 census<ref>INEGI (2007)</ref> showed a total population of 1,350 persons.\n\nThe [[Boroughs of Mexico|borough]] \"seat\" is Cedros town (\"Pueblo Cedros\"), on the southern east coast. Pueblo Cedros is largely associated with ''Pescadores Nacionales de Abul\u00f3n'', the [[lobster]] and [[abalone]] fishing [[cooperative]] based on the island. It was founded by fishermen in 1922.\n\nThe second town is Puerto Morro Redondo (in short, El Morro), close to the southeastern point of the island, El Morro. It is a \"company town,\" built by the joint [[Mexican Government]] and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] to house the workers of the salt-[[transshipment]] facility on the island. Salt from the [[salt evaporation pond]]s of [[Guerrero Negro]] on the [[Baja California peninsula]] is taken by barge to a deepwater salt dock near Puerto Morro Redondo, at the south end of Cedros Island, where it is loaded onto ships for export. There is regularly scheduled air service to the island from Ensenada, departing every Monday and Wednesday, and landing at [[Isla de Cedros Airport|an airstrip]] at the south end, adjacent to the \"company town,\" while a {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} road leads to \"Pueblo Cedros\". Open launch rides across the channel between Cedros and the mainland can also be arranged at the Abarrotes Ramales store in Bahia Tortugas, but travellers opting for this transport should be prepared to have a flexible schedule with several extra days in case of inclement weather conditions in the Channel.\n\nThe remaining settlements are smaller. Jerusalem is just west of El Morro, but on the western side of the airport, with regularly arranged residential units. It is frequently considered part of El Morro.\n\nLomas Blancas, a mining town with 17 buildings, is located between Cedros town and El Morro.\n\nSan Agust\u00edn, a typical fishing village with about 20 buildings, is located {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} northeast of the southwestern point of the island, Cabo San Agust\u00edn.\n\nLa Colorada, on the southwest coast, with about 10 buildings, is {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north of San Agust\u00edn.\n\nWayle, 15 buildings on the western side of the southern bight ''Bah\u00eda del Sur'', is {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} northeast of San Agust\u00edn.\n\nThe mining town of Punta Norte (about 25 buildings) is located on the northeast coast, {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=on}} southeast of the northern end of the island, which is also called Punta Norte. {{convert|2|km|0|spell=In|abbr=out}} to the southeast is Los Crestones mine.\n\nList of settlements and locations:\n#Isla de Cedros, {{coord|28|05|45.5|N|115|11|12.4|W}}\n#Puerto Morro Redondo, {{coord|28|02|18.6|N|115|11|12.0|W}}\n#Jerusalem, {{coord|28|02|24|N|115|11|29|W}}\n#Lomas Blancas, {{coord|28|04|44|N|115|11|07|W}}\n#San Agust\u00edn, {{coord|28|04|54.6|N|115|20|20.6|W}}\n#La Colorada, {{coord|28|07|01.2|N|115|21|07.0|W}}\n#Wayle, {{coord|28|05|34|N|115|18|47|W}}\n#Punta Norte, {{coord|28|21|15|N|115|11|39|W}}\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Hook (AM 1939.232-7).jpg|thumb|Native American shell fish hook from California.

Many scientists now believe that the earliest inhabitants arrived by boat, and findings on Cedros Island bolster that theory. The [[Clovis culture]], which began about 11,200 BCE, is the earliest universally acknowledged evidence of man in the Americas; but the remains of ancient people dating to earlier than 10,000 BCE have been found on Cedros Island.  Cedros Island was attractive to humans because of its rich marine environment and its relative abundance of water compared to most of the desert coastline of Baja California.  The early people of Cedros Island fished, gathered [[shellfish]], and hunted [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, and [[seabird]]s. Ancient spear points and shell fishhooks found on Cedros are similar to those found in a semi-circle of the Pacific coastline from [[Okinawa]] to [[Peru]].<ref>Des Lauriers, Matthew R.

The fishing village and cannery at Puerto Cedros were established in 1920.  The fishing cooperative was founded in 1943, and the deepwater salt dock at the south end of the island was built in 1966. The island was mapped in detail by Mexican and U.S. geologists during the 1970s.\n\n== Natural history ==\nCedros Island is at most some {{convert|38|km|1|abbr=out}} long in N-S direction and  {{convert|6.4|to|8|km|0|abbr=out}} wide in the northern half; the southern end is some {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=out}} wide in a NW-SE direction.<ref>DigitalGlobe ''et al.'' (2007). The measurements in Thayer & Bangs (1907) are in nautical miles.</ref> The island consists of a variety of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, including part of an ophiolite complex and high-pressure, low temperature blueschists. Most of the rocks are of Mesozoic age, though some late Cenozoic strata crop out near the town in the southeastern corner of the island. Its highest peak, Monte Cedros, has an elevation of {{convert|1205|m|0|abbr=out}}.\n\n===Flora===\nThe most common vegetation for more than 90 percent of the land on the island is desert scrub of many different species. The lower elevations, especially the south, receive very sparse rainfall.  However, the northern and western parts of the island are often shrouded in fog, and some plants have adapted to receiving moisture from fog.  The fog plus the slightly greater rainfall at higher elevations has permitted the existence of [[Monterey pine]] forests at elevations of {{convert|500|m|ft}} to {{convert|800|m|ft}} where the influence of the fog is most intense.  The pine forests are scattered and only cover 0.46 percent of the total area of the island.  The pines grow to a height of up to {{convert|10|m|ft}}.  [[California juniper]] are also found at similar altitudes, covering 0.05 percent of the land area.<ref>Oberbauer, pp. 118-120</ref>\n\nAt the highest elevations of the island, above and mixed in with the pine forests, [[chaparral]] vegetation is found.  The chaparral averages {{convert|3|m|ft}} in height and consists of several woody species including [[Quercus cedrosensis]], the Cedar Island live oak. Chaparral covers 2.4 percent of the land area of Cedar Island.<ref>Oberbauer, pp. 118-119</ref>\n\nVargas or El Aguaje de Vargas is the most important spring with a flow of 180 drums of 200 lts or 55 US gal (208 l; 46 imp gal) every 12 hours; springs on the island are usually marked by groves of palm trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fauna===\nLarge [[sea lion]] colonies are found on the rocks on the west side as well as the anchorage on the north end.\n\nThere are feral [[goat]]s on Cedros. Unlike on other islands in the region (notably [[Guadalupe Island]]), they do not seem to have had a significant impact on the island ecosystem. This would be due to the fact that Cedros is on the [[continental shelf]] close to the coast and, at least temporarily, it was connected to the mainland during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] when [[sea level]]s were lower than today. Then, and as a consequence of this, there are native to Cedros [[herbivore]]s, which on one hand compete with the goat population for food and presumably have kept it from increasing beyond [[carrying capacity]], and on the other hand forced the native plants to keep their defenses against herbivores, unlike plants on islands without [[megaherbivore]]s which tend to lack those defenses.\n\nFish are abundant around Cedros Island. [[Yellowtail amberjack#California yellowtail|California yellowtail]], a subspecies of [[yellowtail amberjack]], are very plentiful at this island because of yellowtail breed there. These fish like to live in the kelp beds of the island. Other fish, such as [[Paralabrax clathratus|calico bass]] and [[Archosargus probatocephalus|sheepshead]] are also very plentiful at this island.\n\n=== Endemism ===\nCedros Island is home to a number of [[taxa]] that are [[endemism|endemic]] to or occur in very few places outside the island.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Tonyhallagh was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687.\n\nIn the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] Talbot's lands in Tonyhallagh were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'' and the tenant as ''Gilleesaog O'Rely'', who also appear as proprietor and tenant for several other Templeport townlands. In the same survey Blackforde is also listed as the proprietor of ''Rosstawny''. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Tonyhallagh alias Townehuck''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Tonyhallagh was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687.\n\nIn the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] Talbot's lands in Tonyhallagh were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'' and the tenant as ''Gilleesaog O'Rely'', who also appear as proprietor and tenant for several other Templeport townlands. In the same survey Blackforde is also listed as the proprietor of ''Rosstawny''. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Tonyhallagh alias Townehuck''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727. The Blachford family gravestones in Templeport Church read as follows- ''This monument was erected by MAJOR WILLIAM / BLASHFORD of Lisnover in 1721 to the memory of / his father, JOHN BLASHFORD, late of the same Esqr. but / from Dorchester in Dorsetshire, the place of his / nativity, who in his lifetime chose this for a burying / place, for himself and family, but died in Dublin / was buried in St. Orvins Church but his wife, MARY / RENALD of a Devonsheire family is buried here / as also three sons and two daughters, viz JOHN / AMBROSE AND THOMAS; MARY AND FRANCES / Here likewise lies buried two wives of MAJOR WILLIAM BLASHFORD, son to the said JOHN BLASHFORD viz / MARY MAGHEE of an ancient Family in Lincolnsheire.

The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service.

With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.\n\nAmong other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.\n\nConcorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest, organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]] of London, beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both A\u00e9rospatiale and BAC) also contributed to the retirement.<ref name=\"BBC Concorde Grounded\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}\n\nAt the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nThis same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>\nJan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html \"High altitude flying with F-104\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge.</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Slender deltas===\nSoon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich K\u00fcchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the \"slender delta\" concept.<ref name='deltawing'>{{cite journal|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723|title=The development of the slender delta concept|journal=Aircraft Engineering|author=Maltby, R.L.|volume=40|issue=3|pages=12\u201317|date=1968|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes|archivedate=26 May 2013|doi=10.1108/eb034350}}</ref><ref name=aerosoc>{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}</ref> The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,<ref>''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236</ref> worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.<ref name=aerosoc />{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nK\u00fcchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.<ref name=aerosoc /> The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown /> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.\n\nK\u00fcchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 \"Wings On My Sleeve\"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>\n\n===Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee===\n[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]\n\nOn 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee'' (''STAC''){{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} (sometimes referred to as the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''), with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown /> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}}, about {{sfrac|1|3}} that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}\n\nSTAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nSTAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about \u00a375 to \u00a390&nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps \u00a350 to \u00a380&nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol Type 223#STAC|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\n===Ogee planform selected===\nK\u00fcchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the \"[[ogive|ogival]] wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\nGenerally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or \"lift point\") close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.<ref group=N>Or, more rarely, \"bent\" back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].</ref> With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]\n\nWhile the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,<ref>J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf \"Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)\"], RAE Bedford, 1964.</ref> but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].\n\nTo test the new wing, NASA privately assisted the team by modifying a [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]] with temporary wing modifications to mimic the wing selection. In 1965 the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA Ames test center also ran simulations which showed that the aircraft would suffer a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.38</ref>\n\n===Partnership with Sud Aviation===\nBy this time similar political and economic concerns in France<!-- do not link major countries--> had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about \"the following year\" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on K\u00fcchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nAs soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&nbsp;\u2013 above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that K\u00fcchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nThe only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}\n\n===Cabinet response, treaty===\nWhile the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\nWhen the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be \u00a3150&nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the \u00a3150&nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.\"{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nThis concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nAfter considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}\n\nThe development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com. Retrieved 8 September 2007.</ref>\n\n===Naming===\nReflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde's construction, the name ''Concorde'' is from the French word ''[[wikt:concorde#French|concorde]]'' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0254\u0303k\u0254\u0281d|IPA}}), which has an English equivalent, ''[[wikt:concord#English|concord]]''.

Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns ([[jetstream]]s).{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=84}} Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=3}} block, allowing for a slow climb from {{convert|45000|to|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.<ref>[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2).

At [[Rotation (aviation)|rotation]], Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation ({{convert|199|knot|disp=or}} [[indicated airspeed]]), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title=The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=iasa.com.au |date=13 May 2001 |first=David |last=Rose |access-date=26 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207121508/http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |archive-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent [[tailstrike]]s.

Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop.

This fragment punctured a tyre<!-- please leave British spelling of \"tyres\" on British/French aircraft ---> on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the H\u00f4telissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.{{sfn|Endres|2001|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nThe claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of then [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]'s aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|title=What Price Supersonic Grandeur?|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|archivedate=28 March 2016}}</ref> British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear.

As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a \"thud\" was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor [[Compressor stall|engine surge]]. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.<ref name=AAIB89 /> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.<ref name=AAIB89 />\n* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.<ref name=AAIB93 /> The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.<ref name=AAIB93 />\n* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|url-status=dead|title=Joseph A.

Each 1 percent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 percent.

Sobieczky (1997) <br>Quote: <br>\"The program's cost, through March 1976, was put at between 1.5 and 2.1 billion in 1976 pounds sterling, or between 3.6 and 5.1 billion in 1977 U.S. dollars (yearly weighted exchange rates).\"</ref> It was this extreme cost that became the main factor in the production run being much smaller than anticipated.<ref>In ''Concorde'' (BBC Timewatch, 2003) Chris Benjamin, Concorde Administrator (UK) 1971\u201374 said: \"It's really a matter of great regret that an enormous amount of creativity, effort and resources were used to produce this aeroplane which has actually no sustainable benefit at all.\"</ref> Later, another factor, which affected the viability of all [[supersonic transport]] programmes, was that supersonic flight could only be used on ocean-crossing routes, to prevent [[sonic boom]] disturbance over populated areas. With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.\n\nAmong other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.\n\nConcorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest, organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]] of London, beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both A\u00e9rospatiale and BAC) also contributed to the retirement.<ref name=\"BBC Concorde Grounded\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}\n\nAt the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nThis same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>\nJan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html \"High altitude flying with F-104\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge.</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Slender deltas===\nSoon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich K\u00fcchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the \"slender delta\" concept.<ref name='deltawing'>{{cite journal|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723|title=The development of the slender delta concept|journal=Aircraft Engineering|author=Maltby, R.L.|volume=40|issue=3|pages=12\u201317|date=1968|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes|archivedate=26 May 2013|doi=10.1108/eb034350}}</ref><ref name=aerosoc>{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}</ref> The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,<ref>''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236</ref> worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.<ref name=aerosoc />{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nK\u00fcchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.<ref name=aerosoc /> The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown /> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.\n\nK\u00fcchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 \"Wings On My Sleeve\"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>\n\n===Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee===\n[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]\n\nOn 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee'' (''STAC''){{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} (sometimes referred to as the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''), with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown /> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}}, about {{sfrac|1|3}} that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}\n\nSTAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nSTAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about \u00a375 to \u00a390&nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps \u00a350 to \u00a380&nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol Type 223#STAC|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\n===Ogee planform selected===\nK\u00fcchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the \"[[ogive|ogival]] wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\nGenerally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or \"lift point\") close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.<ref group=N>Or, more rarely, \"bent\" back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].</ref> With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]\n\nWhile the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,<ref>J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf \"Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)\"], RAE Bedford, 1964.</ref> but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].\n\nTo test the new wing, NASA privately assisted the team by modifying a [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]] with temporary wing modifications to mimic the wing selection. In 1965 the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA Ames test center also ran simulations which showed that the aircraft would suffer a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.38</ref>\n\n===Partnership with Sud Aviation===\nBy this time similar political and economic concerns in France<!-- do not link major countries--> had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about \"the following year\" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on K\u00fcchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nAs soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&nbsp;\u2013 above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that K\u00fcchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nThe only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}\n\n===Cabinet response, treaty===\nWhile the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\nWhen the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be \u00a3150&nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the \u00a3150&nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.\"{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nThis concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nAfter considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}\n\nThe development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com. Retrieved 8 September 2007.</ref>\n\n===Naming===\nReflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde's construction, the name ''Concorde'' is from the French word ''[[wikt:concorde#French|concorde]]'' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0254\u0303k\u0254\u0281d|IPA}}), which has an English equivalent, ''[[wikt:concord#English|concord]]''.

Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines situated behind a single intake. An intake failure could lead to a double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag.<ref>Birtles, Philip.

Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.<ref name=\"Concorde nose\" />\n\n[[File:Concorde landing Farnborough Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|Concorde landing at [[Farnborough Aerodrome|Farnborough]] in September 1974]]\nA controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5\u00b0 below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised.

This fragment punctured a tyre<!-- please leave British spelling of \"tyres\" on British/French aircraft ---> on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the H\u00f4telissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.{{sfn|Endres|2001|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nThe claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of then [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]'s aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|title=What Price Supersonic Grandeur?|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|archivedate=28 March 2016}}</ref> British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear.

As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a \"thud\" was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor [[Compressor stall|engine surge]]. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.<ref name=AAIB89 /> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.<ref name=AAIB89 />\n* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.<ref name=AAIB93 /> The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.<ref name=AAIB93 />\n* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|url-status=dead|title=Joseph A.

Each 1 percent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 percent.

In 1813, the diocese gave use of the property to Dom [[Augustin LeStrange]], abbot of a community of [[Trappists]] (from the original monastery of [[La Trappe Abbey|La Trappe]]) who came to America fleeing persecution by French authorities. In addition to a small monastic community, they also looked after some thirty-three orphans. With the downfall of [[Napoleon]] in that year, the Trappists returned to France in 1815, abandoning the property. The property at this point was designated for a future cemetery. The neighboring orphanage was maintained by the diocese into the late nineteenth century.

The previous high altar and [[reredos]] were removed and are now located at Spellman's [[alma mater]], [[Fordham University]], in the University Church. The new items include the [[sanctuary]] bronze [[baldachin]] and the rose stained-glass window. The altar was further renovated in the 1980s under the direction of Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor (cardinal)|John Joseph O'Connor]]. To be more visible to the congregation, a stone altar was built from sections of the side altars and added to the middle of the sanctuary.<ref name=\"NYCarch\" /> However, this altar was removed in 2013.\n\n===Art works===\nThe ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'', sculpted by William Ordway Partridge, is three times larger than [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'']].

The Gallery Organ is located in the Choir Gallery below the Rose Window over the Fifth Avenue entrance and in the Triforium, near the South Transept. The [[Chancel]] Organ is located in the North [[Ambulatory]] next to the Chapel of St. Joseph.\n\n====First organs====\nThe first organ in the Cathedral was built by George Jardine & Son, one of New York's most distinguished organ builders, and installed in 1879. It was composed of 4 manuals with 51 stops and 56 ranks.\n\nIn 1880, J.H. & C.S. Odell, then also from New York City, installed an organ in the chancel. It was composed of 2 manuals with 20 stops and 23 ranks.\n\n====Kilgen organs====\n[[File:500 PATRICK V 5537 best.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior]]\n[[File:Detail of the facade of St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.JPG|thumb|upright|Detail of the entrance (October 2007)]]\n[[File:NYC - Top of the Rock - view of St. Patrick's Cathedral - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright|View from [[Rockefeller Center]] (2016)]]\nWith the addition to the music staff of [[Pietro Yon]] in 1927, plans were initiated to replace the organs. The firm of [[Kilgen|George Kilgen & Son]] of [[St. Louis]], Missouri, was engaged to build two new instruments according to designs which were heavily influenced by the Cathedral's world-renowned organist.\n\nDuring the building period it was determined that the Gallery would need to be extended to accommodate the new Gallery Organ. In the late 1920s, a concrete reinforced extension to the original Gallery was constructed.\n\nThe Chancel Organ was dedicated on January 30, 1928. It is encased in a carved oak screen ornamented with Gothic elements of design and symbolism. It had 1,480 pipes; located on the opposite side of the Ambulatory, diagonally across from the console.\n\nThe Gallery Organ, dedicated on February 11, 1930, required three years to build at a cost of $250,000. It has one of the nation's most glorious wood facades. It was designed by Robert J. Reiley, consulting architect of the Cathedral, and is adorned with angels and Latin inscriptions. It contained 7,855 pipes ranging in length from thirty-two feet to one-half inch. The longest pipes run horizontally across the North and South Triforia.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s tonal changes were made. In the 1970s and 1980s additional renovations were made by Jack Steinkampf of Yonkers, New York, particularly in the revoicing of flutes and reeds, and the addition of the Trompette en Chamade.\n\n====Peragallo restoration====\nIn 1993, it was decided that the organs need to undergo major restoration. The first and most essential part of the restoration project was to acquire new consoles for both the Gallery and Chancel Organs to replace the original ones which had deteriorated beyond repair. Twin five-manual consoles were constructed by Robert Turner of Hacienda Heights, California. Solid State Logic, Ltd. of England designed and engineered the combination action. The use of fiber-optic wiring enables both consoles to control the Gallery, Chancel and Nave Organs at the same time. Installation of the Gallery console was finished in time for Christmas Midnight Mass in 1993. The Chancel console was installed in early 1994.\n\nFor six weeks in January and February 1994, scaffolding filled the Gallery to provide access for wood craftsmen to begin the arduous process of cleaning, repairing, and oiling the hand-carved organ facade. Meanwhile, the [[Peragallo Pipe Organ Company]] of [[Paterson, New Jersey]] had been awarded the contract to clean and restore all of the pipework as well as the chests and wind systems. Their first task was to remove all the facade pipes for cleaning and refinishing. It was decided to return the pipework to its original zinc finish, only adding a protective coating to avoid oxidation in the future. After completing work on the facade, Peragallo moved to the interior of the instrument for the purpose of restoring the Great, Choir, Swell, Solo, String and Pedal divisions. The entire Chancel Organ was restored in 1995. Finally, the Echo Organ, situated in the triforium near the center crossing, underwent tonal modifications, making it more useful as the Nave Organ. The organ work was finished in 1997.\n\nThe Organs were blessed on September 15, 2007 celebrating the 10th anniversary of their renovations and inaugurating the Bicentennial Concert Series with a performance James E. Goettsche, the Vatican Organist.\n\nThe Organs consist of more than 9,000 pipes, 206 stops, 150 ranks and 10 divisions.\n\n===Organists and music directors===\n{| class=wikitable\n! Name !! Title !!

In 1965, the ceremony of the [[papal consistory|consistory]] was revised by Pope Paul VI and therefore no galero was presented to Cardinal Cooke or any of his successors.\n\nSome notable people whose [[Requiem Mass]]es were said at the cathedral include [[New York Yankees]] greats [[Babe Ruth]], [[Roger Maris]], and [[Billy Martin]]; legendary football coach [[Vince Lombardi]], [[New York City Police Department]] officer [[Steven McDonald]], singer [[Celia Cruz]], entertainer and host [[Ed Sullivan]], actor and dancer [[George M.

In addition to a small monastic community, they also looked after some thirty-three orphans. With the downfall of [[Napoleon]] in that year, the Trappists returned to France in 1815, abandoning the property. The property at this point was designated for a future cemetery.

Of these, 130 proceeded to infiltrate the church and disrupted the mass, forcing Cardinal [[John O'Connor (cardinal)|John O'Connor]] to abandon his sermon.

The previous high altar and [[reredos]] were removed and are now located at Spellman's [[alma mater]], [[Fordham University]], in the University Church. The new items include the [[sanctuary]] bronze [[baldachin]] and the rose stained-glass window. The altar was further renovated in the 1980s under the direction of Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor (cardinal)|John Joseph O'Connor]]. To be more visible to the congregation, a stone altar was built from sections of the side altars and added to the middle of the sanctuary.<ref name=\"NYCarch\" /> However, this altar was removed in 2013.\n\n===Art works===\nThe ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'', sculpted by William Ordway Partridge, is three times larger than [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'']].

The Gallery Organ is located in the Choir Gallery below the Rose Window over the Fifth Avenue entrance and in the Triforium, near the South Transept. The [[Chancel]] Organ is located in the North [[Ambulatory]] next to the Chapel of St. Joseph.\n\n====First organs====\nThe first organ in the Cathedral was built by George Jardine & Son, one of New York's most distinguished organ builders, and installed in 1879. It was composed of 4 manuals with 51 stops and 56 ranks.\n\nIn 1880, J.H. & C.S. Odell, then also from New York City, installed an organ in the chancel. It was composed of 2 manuals with 20 stops and 23 ranks.\n\n====Kilgen organs====\n[[File:500 PATRICK V 5537 best.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior]]\n[[File:Detail of the facade of St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.JPG|thumb|upright|Detail of the entrance (October 2007)]]\n[[File:NYC - Top of the Rock - view of St. Patrick's Cathedral - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright|View from [[Rockefeller Center]] (2016)]]\nWith the addition to the music staff of [[Pietro Yon]] in 1927, plans were initiated to replace the organs. The firm of [[Kilgen|George Kilgen & Son]] of [[St. Louis]], Missouri, was engaged to build two new instruments according to designs which were heavily influenced by the Cathedral's world-renowned organist.\n\nDuring the building period it was determined that the Gallery would need to be extended to accommodate the new Gallery Organ. In the late 1920s, a concrete reinforced extension to the original Gallery was constructed.\n\nThe Chancel Organ was dedicated on January 30, 1928. It is encased in a carved oak screen ornamented with Gothic elements of design and symbolism. It had 1,480 pipes; located on the opposite side of the Ambulatory, diagonally across from the console.\n\nThe Gallery Organ, dedicated on February 11, 1930, required three years to build at a cost of $250,000. It has one of the nation's most glorious wood facades. It was designed by Robert J. Reiley, consulting architect of the Cathedral, and is adorned with angels and Latin inscriptions. It contained 7,855 pipes ranging in length from thirty-two feet to one-half inch. The longest pipes run horizontally across the North and South Triforia.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s tonal changes were made. In the 1970s and 1980s additional renovations were made by Jack Steinkampf of Yonkers, New York, particularly in the revoicing of flutes and reeds, and the addition of the Trompette en Chamade.\n\n====Peragallo restoration====\nIn 1993, it was decided that the organs need to undergo major restoration. The first and most essential part of the restoration project was to acquire new consoles for both the Gallery and Chancel Organs to replace the original ones which had deteriorated beyond repair. Twin five-manual consoles were constructed by Robert Turner of Hacienda Heights, California. Solid State Logic, Ltd. of England designed and engineered the combination action. The use of fiber-optic wiring enables both consoles to control the Gallery, Chancel and Nave Organs at the same time. Installation of the Gallery console was finished in time for Christmas Midnight Mass in 1993. The Chancel console was installed in early 1994.\n\nFor six weeks in January and February 1994, scaffolding filled the Gallery to provide access for wood craftsmen to begin the arduous process of cleaning, repairing, and oiling the hand-carved organ facade. Meanwhile, the [[Peragallo Pipe Organ Company]] of [[Paterson, New Jersey]] had been awarded the contract to clean and restore all of the pipework as well as the chests and wind systems. Their first task was to remove all the facade pipes for cleaning and refinishing. It was decided to return the pipework to its original zinc finish, only adding a protective coating to avoid oxidation in the future. After completing work on the facade, Peragallo moved to the interior of the instrument for the purpose of restoring the Great, Choir, Swell, Solo, String and Pedal divisions. The entire Chancel Organ was restored in 1995. Finally, the Echo Organ, situated in the triforium near the center crossing, underwent tonal modifications, making it more useful as the Nave Organ. The organ work was finished in 1997.\n\nThe Organs were blessed on September 15, 2007 celebrating the 10th anniversary of their renovations and inaugurating the Bicentennial Concert Series with a performance James E. Goettsche, the Vatican Organist.\n\nThe Organs consist of more than 9,000 pipes, 206 stops, 150 ranks and 10 divisions.\n\n===Organists and music directors===\n{| class=wikitable\n! Name !! Title !!
