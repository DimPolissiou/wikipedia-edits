The ''[[Oxford Living Dictionaries]]'' defines \"total war\" as \"A war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or [[combatant]]s involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the [[law of war|laws of war]] are disregarded.\"<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/total_war \"Total war\" ''[[Oxford Living Dictionaries]]''</ref>\n\nIn the mid-19th century, scholars identified total war as a separate class of warfare.

Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort. Even the [[Music Hall]] was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment.\n\nAfter the failure of the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal]] John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]]. This led to the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] which brought down both the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Premiership]] of [[H. H. Asquith]]. He formed a new coalition government dominated by Liberals and appointed [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]]. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front.\n\n[[Carl Schmitt]], a supporter of [[Nazi Germany]], wrote that total war meant \"total politics\"\u2014authoritarian domestic policies that imposed direct control of the press and economy. In Schmitt's view the total state, which directs fully the mobilization of all social and economic resources to war, is antecedent to total war. Scholars consider that the seeds of this total state concept already existed in the German state of World War I, which exercised full control of the press and other aspects economic and social life as espoused in the statement of state ideology known as the \"[[Fascism#World_War_I_and_its_aftermath_(1914\u20131929)|Ideas of 1914]]\".<ref name=demm>{{cite journal|title=Propaganda and Caricature in the First World War|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=28|pages=163\u2013192|doi=10.1177/002200949302800109|year=1993|last1=Demm|first1=Eberhard}}</ref>\n\n=====Rationing=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nAs young men left the farms for the front, domestic food production in Britain and Germany fell. In Britain the response was to import more food, which was done despite the German introduction of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], and to introduce rationing. The Royal Navy's [[Blockade of Germany|blockade of German ports]] prevented Germany from importing food and hastened German capitulation by creating a food crisis in Germany.\n\nAlmost the whole of [[Europe]] and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage [[World War I]]. Rationing occurred on the home fronts. [[Bulgaria]] went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population, or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.\n\n[[File:Founding Ceremony of the Hakko-Ichiu Monument.JPG|thumb|Founding ceremony of the ''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]'' Monument, promoting the unification of \"the 8 corners of the world under one roof\"]] Pornhub\n\n====World War II====\nThe [[Second World War]] was the quintessential total war of modernity. The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the [[battlespace]] being contested, the scale of the [[army|armies]], [[navy|navies]], and [[air force]]s raised through [[conscription]], the active targeting of non-combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for [[collateral damage]], and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale.\n\n=====Sh\u014dwa Japan=====\nDuring the first part of the [[Sh\u014dwa era]], the government of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against China]] and [[Pacific war|occidental powers]] and increase industrial production. Among these were the [[National Spiritual Mobilization Movement]] and the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]].\n\nThe [[National Mobilization Law]] had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including [[labor union]]s), [[nationalization]] of strategic industries, price controls and [[rationing]], and nationalized the [[news media]].<ref>Pauer, Japan's War Economy, 1999 pp. 13</ref> The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.\n\nTo improve its production, Sh\u014dwa Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers<ref>Unidas, Naciones. ''World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration'', p. 23</ref> and [[Slavery in Japan|pressed more than 18 million people]] in [[East Asia]] into forced labor.<ref>Zhifen Ju, \"''Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war''\", 2002, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, \"Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942\u201350; The Japanese Occupation, 1942\u201345\"] Access date: February 9, 2007.</ref>\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nBefore the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] drew on its [[World War I|First World War]] experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out.\n\nRationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers. This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed. All artificial light was subject to legal [[Blackout (wartime)|blackouts]].\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=30em\n|quote=\"..There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women and children. The fronts are everywhere to be seen.

The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the same courage.\"\n|source=<small>''[[Winston Churchill]] on the radio, June 18 ; and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] 20 August 1940:''<ref>Winston Churchill ''[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/1940-finest-hour/113-the-few The Few]'' The Churchill Centre</ref></small>\n|}}\n\nNot only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as [[Women's Land Army (World War II)|Land Girls]] to aid farmers and the [[Bevin Boys]] were conscripted to work down the coal mines.\n\nEnormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during the Second World War|children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside]] for compulsory [[billet]]ing in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain. This is because it mixed up children with the adults of other classes. Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the [[slum]]s, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life.\n\nThe use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as [[Operational Research]] to influence military tactics was a departure from anything previously attempted. It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies which were counter intuitive. Examples where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by [[Patrick Blackett]]'s team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of [[bomber stream]]s by the [[Royal Air Force]] to counter the night fighter defences of the [[Kammhuber Line]].\n\n=====Germany=====\n{{see also|Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War}}\n\nIn contrast, [[Germany]] started the war under the concept of [[Blitzkrieg]]. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943.\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=30em\n|quote=\"I ask you: Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even imagine today?\"\n|source=<small>''[[National Socialist|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], 18 February 1943, in his [[Sportpalast speech]]''</small>\n|}}\n\nThe commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the [[Operation Barbarossa]]. A major strategical defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] forced [[Albert Speer]], who was appointed as Germany's armament minister in early 1942, to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.<ref>A. S. Milward. The End of the Blitzkrieg. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1964), pp. 499\u2013518.</ref>\n\nUnder Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944. To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years. It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack. Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high. These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing.\n\nPlant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed. Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces).\n\n=====Soviet Union=====\n[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|Three men burying victims of [[siege of Leningrad|Leningrad's siege]], in which about 1 million civilians died]]\n\nThe Soviet Union (USSR) was a [[planned economy|command economy]] which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war. The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the [[Urals]] as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning. Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government.\n\nThe Eastern Front of the [[European Theatre of World War II]] encompassed the conflict in [[central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and [[World War II casualties|casualties]] and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see [[World War II casualties]]). The fighting involved millions of [[Nazi army|German]], Hungarian, Romanian and [[Red army|Soviet]] troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of [[World War II]]. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against [[Hitler]]'s armies or died in [[POW]] camps. Millions of civilians died from [[starvation]], exposure, atrocities, and massacres.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm |work= BBC.co.uk |title= Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead |accessdate= 5 August 2015|date= 2005-05-09 }}</ref> The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.<ref>German losses according to: R\u00fcdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''.

Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.\n\nThe strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly. The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with [[Lend-Lease]] programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well.\n\nAmerican [[public opinion]] was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however. In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well. American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the [[Empire of Japan]] was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China.\n\nIn late 1941, Japan's [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]]-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade. Planning for this action included [[surprise attack]]s on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at [[Pearl Harbor]]. In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the [[Empire of Japan]] the next day. [[Nazi Germany]] declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war.\n\nAs the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion. Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production. Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories. Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military \"for the duration\" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs.\n\nPreviously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort. Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production. The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them.\n\nBy the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences. Even the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] on the [[Manhattan Project]] that culminated in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] and changed the course of history.\n\nIn the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered. The U.S. emerged as one of the two [[superpower]]s after the war.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world since 1945: a history of international relations|last=McWilliams|first=Wayne|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=====Unconditional surrender=====\n{{off topic section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=30em\n|quote=\"Actually [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]] was a mass of munitions works, an intact government centre, and a key transportation point to the East.

Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II [[Romanian People's Tribunals]]. To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them. Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (''[[debellatio]]'') so the provisions of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] over [[military occupation]] were not applicable.<ref>Ruth Wedgwood {{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |title=Judicial Overreach |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308191908/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2008 }} [[Wall Street Journal]] November 16, 2004</ref>\n\n==Present day==\n{{See also|War by proxy|Coercive diplomacy|Deterrence theory}}\nSince the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war.<ref name=\"GWUniversityWWII\">{{cite web|title=World War II (1939\u20131945)|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/world-war-2.cfm|website=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=19 January 2017}}</ref> This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II logistically impractical and strategically irrelevant.{{sfn|Baylis|Wirtz|Gray|2012|p=55}} Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the [[Cold War]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other.

Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort. Even the [[Music Hall]] was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment.\n\nAfter the failure of the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal]] John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]]. This led to the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] which brought down both the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Premiership]] of [[H. H. Asquith]]. He formed a new coalition government dominated by Liberals and appointed [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]]. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front.\n\n[[Carl Schmitt]], a supporter of [[Nazi Germany]], wrote that total war meant \"total politics\"\u2014authoritarian domestic policies that imposed direct control of the press and economy. In Schmitt's view the total state, which directs fully the mobilization of all social and economic resources to war, is antecedent to total war. Scholars consider that the seeds of this total state concept already existed in the German state of World War I, which exercised full control of the press and other aspects economic and social life as espoused in the statement of state ideology known as the \"[[Fascism#World_War_I_and_its_aftermath_(1914\u20131929)|Ideas of 1914]]\".<ref name=demm>{{cite journal|title=Propaganda and Caricature in the First World War|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=28|pages=163\u2013192|doi=10.1177/002200949302800109|year=1993|last1=Demm|first1=Eberhard}}</ref>\n\n=====Rationing=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nAs young men left the farms for the front, domestic food production in Britain and Germany fell. In Britain the response was to import more food, which was done despite the German introduction of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], and to introduce rationing. The Royal Navy's [[Blockade of Germany|blockade of German ports]] prevented Germany from importing food and hastened German capitulation by creating a food crisis in Germany.\n\nAlmost the whole of [[Europe]] and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage [[World War I]]. Rationing occurred on the home fronts. [[Bulgaria]] went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population, or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.\n\n[[File:Founding Ceremony of the Hakko-Ichiu Monument.JPG|thumb|Founding ceremony of the ''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]'' Monument, promoting the unification of \"the 8 corners of the world under one roof\"]]\n\n====World War II====\nThe [[Second World War]] was the quintessential total war of modernity. The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the [[battlespace]] being contested, the scale of the [[army|armies]], [[navy|navies]], and [[air force]]s raised through [[conscription]], the active targeting of non-combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for [[collateral damage]], and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale.\n\n=====Sh\u014dwa Japan=====\nDuring the first part of the [[Sh\u014dwa era]], the government of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against China]] and [[Pacific war|occidental powers]] and increase industrial production. Among these were the [[National Spiritual Mobilization Movement]] and the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]].\n\nThe [[National Mobilization Law]] had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including [[labor union]]s), [[nationalization]] of strategic industries, price controls and [[rationing]], and nationalized the [[news media]].<ref>Pauer, Japan's War Economy, 1999 pp. 13</ref> The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.\n\nTo improve its production, Sh\u014dwa Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers<ref>Unidas, Naciones. ''World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration'', p. 23</ref> and [[Slavery in Japan|pressed more than 18 million people]] in [[East Asia]] into forced labor.<ref>Zhifen Ju, \"''Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war''\", 2002, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, \"Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942\u201350; The Japanese Occupation, 1942\u201345\"] Access date: February 9, 2007.</ref>\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nBefore the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] drew on its [[World War I|First World War]] experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out.\n\nRationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers. This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed. All artificial light was subject to legal [[Blackout (wartime)|blackouts]].\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=30em\n|quote=\"..There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women and children. The fronts are everywhere to be seen.

The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the same courage.\"\n|source=<small>''[[Winston Churchill]] on the radio, June 18 ; and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] 20 August 1940:''<ref>Winston Churchill ''[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/1940-finest-hour/113-the-few The Few]'' The Churchill Centre</ref></small>\n|}}\n\nNot only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as [[Women's Land Army (World War II)|Land Girls]] to aid farmers and the [[Bevin Boys]] were conscripted to work down the coal mines.\n\nEnormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during the Second World War|children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside]] for compulsory [[billet]]ing in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain. This is because it mixed up children with the adults of other classes. Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the [[slum]]s, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life.\n\nThe use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as [[Operational Research]] to influence military tactics was a departure from anything previously attempted. It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies which were counter intuitive. Examples where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by [[Patrick Blackett]]'s team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of [[bomber stream]]s by the [[Royal Air Force]] to counter the night fighter defences of the [[Kammhuber Line]].\n\n=====Germany=====\n{{see also|Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War}}\n\nIn contrast, [[Germany]] started the war under the concept of [[Blitzkrieg]]. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943.\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=30em\n|quote=\"I ask you: Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even imagine today?\"\n|source=<small>''[[National Socialist|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], 18 February 1943, in his [[Sportpalast speech]]''</small>\n|}}\n\nThe commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the [[Operation Barbarossa]]. A major strategical defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] forced [[Albert Speer]], who was appointed as Germany's armament minister in early 1942, to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.<ref>A. S. Milward. The End of the Blitzkrieg. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1964), pp. 499\u2013518.</ref>\n\nUnder Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944. To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years. It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack. Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high. These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing.\n\nPlant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed. Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces).\n\n=====Soviet Union=====\n[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|Three men burying victims of [[siege of Leningrad|Leningrad's siege]], in which about 1 million civilians died]]\n\nThe Soviet Union (USSR) was a [[planned economy|command economy]] which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war. The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the [[Urals]] as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning. Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government.\n\nThe Eastern Front of the [[European Theatre of World War II]] encompassed the conflict in [[central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and [[World War II casualties|casualties]] and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see [[World War II casualties]]). The fighting involved millions of [[Nazi army|German]], Hungarian, Romanian and [[Red army|Soviet]] troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of [[World War II]]. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against [[Hitler]]'s armies or died in [[POW]] camps. Millions of civilians died from [[starvation]], exposure, atrocities, and massacres.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm |work= BBC.co.uk |title= Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead |accessdate= 5 August 2015|date= 2005-05-09 }}</ref> The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.<ref>German losses according to: R\u00fcdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''.

Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.\n\nThe strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly. The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with [[Lend-Lease]] programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well.\n\nAmerican [[public opinion]] was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however. In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well. American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the [[Empire of Japan]] was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China.\n\nIn late 1941, Japan's [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]]-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade. Planning for this action included [[surprise attack]]s on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at [[Pearl Harbor]]. In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the [[Empire of Japan]] the next day. [[Nazi Germany]] declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war.\n\nAs the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion. Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production. Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories. Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military \"for the duration\" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs.\n\nPreviously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort. Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production. The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them.\n\nBy the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences. Even the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] on the [[Manhattan Project]] that culminated in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] and changed the course of history.\n\nIn the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered.

Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II [[Romanian People's Tribunals]]. To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them. Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (''[[debellatio]]'') so the provisions of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] over [[military occupation]] were not applicable.<ref>Ruth Wedgwood {{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |title=Judicial Overreach |accessdate=2008-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308191908/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2008 }} [[Wall Street Journal]] November 16, 2004</ref>\n\n==Present day==\n{{See also|War by proxy|Coercive diplomacy|Deterrence theory}}\nSince the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war.<ref name=\"GWUniversityWWII\">{{cite web|title=World War II (1939\u20131945)|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/world-war-2.cfm|website=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=19 January 2017}}</ref> This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II logistically impractical and strategically irrelevant.{{sfn|Baylis|Wirtz|Gray|2012|p=55}} Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the [[Cold War]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other.

His suitability for retaining his Senate seat depended on whether he had taken appropriate steps to renounce his British citizenship prior to his nomination. Between August and October 2017, Roberts stated several changing and contradictory positions regarding his citizenship, including that he had \"absolute conviction\" of being an Australian upon nomination, that he had emailed British authorities on 1 May 2016, first requesting to renounce his citizenship, and upon receiving no reply for a month, sent a subsequent email on 6 June (three days after his nomination) stating, \"As there was no reply to my email last month (see below) and although I am confident I am not a British citizen, with this email I renounce any British citizenship should it exist.\" It was subsequently revealed that the email domains that Roberts had contacted were defunct and no longer in use. Roberts sent a formal application to renounce his United Kingdom citizenship on 2 November 2016, and his renouncement became official on 5 December 2016.\n\nA final decision regarding Roberts's senatorial eligibility was scheduled to be heard by the High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, between 10 and 12 October 2017.

The British nationality experts' opinion was that Roberts became a British citizen at birth (whether registered or not), and ceased to be a British citizen on 5 December 2016 when his renunciation was registered. Keane J found that Roberts knew he did not become an Australian citizen until May 1974 and that, when he nominated for the Senate, he knew there was a possibility that he might have been, and remained, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Keane J found that his actions before nomination had been ineffectual to renounce his UK citizenship, which had been belatedly renounced on 5 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/Re-Roberts-2017-HCA-39.pdf |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]] |title=In the Matter of questions referred to the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to Section 376 of the Comnmonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) concerning Senator Malcolm Roberts |id=Re Roberts [2017] HCA 39 22 September 2017 C14/2017 |accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 October 2017 the full High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, ruled that Roberts had been ineligible to be elected to the Parliament.

His suitability for retaining his Senate seat depended on whether he had taken appropriate steps to renounce his British citizenship prior to his nomination. Between August and October 2017, Roberts stated several changing and contradictory positions regarding his citizenship, including that he had \"absolute conviction\" of being an Australian upon nomination, that he had emailed British authorities on 1 May 2016, first requesting to renounce his citizenship, and upon receiving no reply for a month, sent a subsequent email on 6 June (three days after his nomination) stating, \"As there was no reply to my email last month (see below) and although I am confident I am not a British citizen, with this email I renounce any British citizenship should it exist.\" It was subsequently revealed that the email domains that Roberts had contacted were defunct and no longer in use. Roberts sent a formal application to renounce his United Kingdom citizenship on 2 November 2016, and his renouncement became official on 5 December 2016.\n\nA final decision regarding Roberts's senatorial eligibility was scheduled to be heard by the High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, between 10 and 12 October 2017.  However, the Court delegated the fact-finding task to a single judge, [[Patrick Keane|Justice Keane]], before whom Roberts appeared on 21 September and who reported his findings on the following day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/22/malcolm-roberts-was-dual-british-and-australian-citizen-when-nominated-judge-rules|title=Malcolm Roberts was dual British and Australian citizen when nominated, judge rules|last=Robertson|first=Joshua|work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2017|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Roberts's birth in India, the UK High Commission registered his birth as a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]], and the Australian Trade Commissioner made an entry in his mother's passport that he \"is the child of an Australian citizen but has not acquired Australian citizenship\". The British nationality experts' opinion was that Roberts became a British citizen at birth (whether registered or not), and ceased to be a British citizen on 5 December 2016 when his renunciation was registered. Keane J found that Roberts knew he did not become an Australian citizen until May 1974 and that, when he nominated for the Senate, he knew there was a possibility that he might have been, and remained, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Keane J found that his actions before nomination had been ineffectual to renounce his UK citizenship, which had been belatedly renounced on 5 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/Re-Roberts-2017-HCA-39.pdf |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]] |title=In the Matter of questions referred to the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to Section 376 of the Comnmonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) concerning Senator Malcolm Roberts |id=Re Roberts [2017] HCA 39 22 September 2017 C14/2017 |accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 October 2017 the full High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, ruled that Roberts had been ineligible to be elected to the Parliament.
