{"title_page": "Star Wars opening crawl", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Star Wars'' opening crawl }}\n[[Image:Opening crawl.jpg|thumb|300px|Three [[Film frame|frames]] representative of opening sequences from films in the [[Skywalker Saga]]. The phrase \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\" which remains static on the screen and the ''Star Wars'' logo which shrinks to a central point are common to all of the films and are followed by a film specific opening crawl.  The example shown comes from a post-1981 re-release as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''.]]\nThe '''''Star Wars'' opening crawl''' is a signature device of the opening sequences of every numbered film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. Within a black sky background featuring a smattering of stars, the crawl is preceded both by the static blue text, '''\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\"''' and by the ''Star Wars'' logo which recedes toward a central point on the screen before disappearing.  The crawl text, which describes the [[backstory]] and context of the film, then recedes toward a higher point in relation to the screen and with an apparent effect of disappearing in the distance. The visuals are accompanied by the \"[[Star Wars Theme|Main Title Theme]]\", composed by [[John Williams]].\n\nThis sequence has featured at the beginning each of the main ''Star Wars'' saga theatrical films produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series.{{explain|date=March 2020}} It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.\n\nThe opening crawl was not used in the animated film [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] or in the ''Star Wars'' \"Anthology\" films, ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|''Solo'']], although all three films begin with the opening text, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\". Additionally, the opening  sequence of ''Solo'' continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text, while ''The Clone Wars'' uses a narrator to provide exposition in a similar style to a [[newsreel]].\n\n==Structure==\nEach film opens with the static blue text, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\", followed by the ''Star Wars'' [[logo]] shrinking in front of a field of stars, as if moving away from the viewer. Initially the logo's extremities are beyond the edge of the frame. While the logo is retreating, the \"crawl\" text begins, starting with the film's episode number and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] (with the exception of the original release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Star Wars opening crawl#Episode IV opening crawl|see below]]), and followed by a three-paragraph prologue to the film.

In 1976, Lucas invited Perri to [[Industrial Light & Magic]], Lucasfilm's post-production operation at [[Van Nuys]], California. Perri, who had previously worked on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', suggested that they take inspiration from the 1939 [[Cecil B.

Lucas eventually rejected Perri's logo due to readability problems, turning instead to the graphic designer [[Suzy Rice]], an art director at the [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising agency]] [[Seiniger Advertising]]. Lucas had commissioned Rice to design a promotional brochure that was to be distributed to cinema theatre owners. He instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear \"very [[fascism|fascist]]\" in style. Rice, inspired by historical German [[typography]], produced a bold logotype using an outlined, modified [[Helvetica|Helvetica Black]]. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the ''S'' and ''T'' of ''STAR'' and the ''R'' and ''S'' of ''WARS''. Lucas's producer, [[Gary Kurtz]], found that Rice's logo worked well in the opening title; the logo was modified further to flatten the  pointed tips on the letter ''W'' before it was inserted into the final cut. While Perri's skewed logo did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising, and it featured prominently on [[film poster]]s promoting the release of ''Star Wars'' on cinema billboards in 1977 (notably [[Tom Jung]]'s ''[[:File:StarWarsMoviePoster1977.jpg|Style \u2018A\u2019 poster]]'', the [[:File:Bros Hildebrandt Star Wars quad poster.jpg|''Style \u2018B\u2019'' poster]] by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and [[Tom Chantrell]]'s [[:File:Tom Chantrell Star Wars quad poster 1977.jpg|''Style \u2018C\u2019'' poster]]).<ref name=\"taylor-logo\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|date=2014|publisher=Head of Zeus|isbn=9781784970451|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z7GbBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT186&dq=suzy%20rice%20star%20wars%20logo&pg=PT185#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=1 June 2016|chapter=11.

The phrase \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\" which remains static on the screen and the ''Star Wars'' logo which shrinks to a central point are common to all of the films and are followed by a film specific opening crawl.  The example shown comes from a post-1981 re-release as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''.]]\nThe '''''Star Wars'' opening crawl''' is a signature device of the opening sequences of every numbered film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. Within a black sky background featuring a smattering of stars, the crawl is preceded both by the static blue text, '''\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\"''' and by the ''Star Wars'' logo which recedes toward a central point on the screen before disappearing.  The crawl text, which describes the [[backstory]] and context of the film, then recedes toward a higher point in relation to the screen and with an apparent effect of disappearing in the distance. The visuals are accompanied by the \"[[Star Wars Theme|Main Title Theme]]\", composed by [[John Williams]].\n\nThis sequence has featured at the beginning each of the main ''Star Wars'' saga theatrical films produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series.{{explain|date=March 2020}} It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.\n\nThe opening crawl was not used in the animated film [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] or in the ''Star Wars'' \"Anthology\" films, ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|''Solo'']], although all three films begin with the opening text, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\". Additionally, the opening  sequence of ''Solo'' continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text, while ''The Clone Wars'' uses a narrator to provide exposition in a similar style to a [[newsreel]].\n\n==Structure==\nEach film opens with the static blue text, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\", followed by the ''Star Wars'' [[logo]] shrinking in front of a field of stars, as if moving away from the viewer. Initially the logo's extremities are beyond the edge of the frame. While the logo is retreating, the \"crawl\" text begins, starting with the film's episode number and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] (with the exception of the original release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Star Wars opening crawl#Episode IV opening crawl|see below]]), and followed by a three-paragraph prologue to the film.

This gas is called [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can; they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma that can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds.\n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581|doi=10.1038/35001196|pmid=10688162|bibcode=2000Natur.403..581A|issn=0028-0836|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|bibcode=2010PhT....63e..39J|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> Comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

Among the most discussed challenges has been the question if the abundance of particles produced is enhanced or if the comparison base line is suppressed. Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is rarely produced. This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Rolf|date=|year=1968|title=Statistical thermodynamics of strong interactions at high energies - III : heavy pair(quark) production rates|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/936485|journal=Nuovo Cimento Suppl.|volume=6|pages=311-354|via=}}</ref> and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears.

This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) compared to <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>). The [[ALICE experiment]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity, the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) as the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) that requires two pairs minimum to be made.

ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume, there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead, this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise. The [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size.

Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions remains an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of [[Flavour (particle physics)|charm and bottom flavor]].<ref name=\":7\" /> When QGP is formed, these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present.

In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own data analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species that follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content.

This gas is called [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can; they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma that can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed.

Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==ALICE: Resolution of remaining questions about strangeness as signature  of quark-gluon plasma==\n[[File:AliceXiPhiRev.png|thumb |280px| LHC-ALICE results for <math>(\\bar{\\Xi}+\\Xi/\\phi)</math> obtained in three different collision systems at highest available energy as a function of charged hadron multiplicity produced.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Sushanta|year=2019|title=Energy dependence of \u03d5(1020) production at mid-rapidity in pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947418302665|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=982|pages=180\u2013182|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.09.078|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Sushanta|date=2019-07-01|title=An insight into strangeness with $\\phi$(1020) production in small to large collision systems with ALICE at the LHC|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00842|journal=arXiv:1907.00842 [hep-ex, physics:nucl-ex]}}</ref>|alt=]]\n[[File:Alice1807StrangeY.png|thumb|280px|Universal dependence of <math>p(uud)+\\bar{p}(\\bar{u}\\bar{u}\\bar{d}),</math><math> K_s(d\\bar{s}+\\bar{d}s),</math><math> \\Lambda(uds)+\\bar{\\Lambda}(\\bar{u}\\bar{d}\\bar{s}), \\phi(s\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Xi^-(dss)+\\bar{\\Xi}^+(\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Omega(sss)+\\bar{\\Omega}(\\bar{s}\\bar{s}\\bar{s})</math> multiplicities (scaled by yield of <math>\\pi^++\\pi^-</math>) obtained in p-p, p-A and A-A by LHC-ALICE experiment at LHC collision energies indicated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Albuquerque|first=D.S.D.|year=2019|title=Hadronic resonances, strange and multi-strange particle production in Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947418301775|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=982|pages=823\u2013826|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.08.033|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|year=2020|title=Discovery of Quark-Gluon Plasma: Strangeness Diaries|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epjst/e2019-900263-x|journal=The European Physical Journal Special Topics|language=en|volume=229|issue=1|pages=1\u2013140|doi=10.1140/epjst/e2019-900263-x|issn=1951-6355|via=}}</ref>]]\nThe very high precision of (strange) particle spectra and large transverse momentum coverage reported by the [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] Collaboration at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) allows in-depth exploration of lingering challenges, which always accompany new physics, and here in particular the questions surrounding strangeness signature. Among the most discussed challenges has been the question if the abundance of particles produced is enhanced or if the comparison base line is suppressed. Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is rarely produced. This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Rolf|date=|year=1968|title=Statistical thermodynamics of strong interactions at high energies - III : heavy pair(quark) production rates|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/936485|journal=Nuovo Cimento Suppl.|volume=6|pages=311-354|via=}}</ref> and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears.

This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) compared to <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>). The [[ALICE experiment]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity, the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) as the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) that requires two pairs minimum to be made.  However, we also see an increase at very high volume\u2014this is an effect at the level of one-two standard deviations. Similar results were already recognized before by Petran et al. .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petr\u00e1\u0148|first=Michal|last2=Rafelski|first2=Johann|year=2010|title=Multistrange particle production and the statistical hadronization model|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=82|issue=1|pages=011901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother highly praised [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] result<ref name=\":0\" /> is the observation of same strangeness enhancement, not only on AA  (nucleus-nucleus) but also in pA (proton-nucleus) and pp (proton-proton) collisions when the particle production yields are presented as a function of the multiplicity, which, as noted, corresponds to the available [[hadronization]] volume. ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume, there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead, this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise. The [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions remains an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of [[Flavour (particle physics)|charm and bottom flavor]].<ref name=\":7\" /> When QGP is formed, these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time, are also likely to appear.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=I. Kuznetsova|author2=J.

These results are presented as function of the variable called [[rapidity]] which characterizes the speed of the source. The peak of emission indicates that the additionally formed antimatter particles do not originate from the colliding nuclei themselves, but from a source that moves at a speed corresponding to one-half of the rapidity of the incident nucleus that is a common center of momentum frame of reference source formed when both nuclei collide, that is, the hot quark\u2013gluon plasma fireball.\n==Horn in <math>K \\rightarrow \\pi </math> ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb|280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions.]]One of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gazdzicki|first=Marek|last2=Gorenstein|first2=Mark|last3=Seyboth|first3=Peter|year=2020|title=Brief history of the search for critical structures in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02255|journal=arXiv:2004.02255 [hep-ph, physics:nucl-ex, physics:nucl-th]|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> It is natural to expect that if such a threshold exists the particle yields/ratios we have shown above should indicate that.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becattini|first=F.|year=2012|title=Strangeness and onset of deconfinement|journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei|language=en|volume=75|issue=5|pages=646\u2013649|doi=10.1134/S106377881205002X|bibcode=2012PAN....75..646B|issn=1063-7788}}</ref> One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative [[Kaon]] yield ratio.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=N.K.

The theoretical work in this field today focuses on the interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup.<ref name=\":6\" /> The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own data analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species that follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated figure with ALICE results", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}
