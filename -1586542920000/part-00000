Eventually, he would act out and get sent to an [[alternative school]] after expulsion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-announces-new-album-adhd-news.62031.html|title=Joyner Lucas Announces New Album \"ADHD\"|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2019|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adhd-joyner-lucas-identity-crisis-or-art-imitating-life-news.90843.html|title=ADHD: Joyner Lucas' Identity Crisis Or Art Imitating Life?|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Feuds ==\n=== Logic ===\nAccording to Lucas, when he was on [[Tech N9ne]] tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album [[The Storm (Tech N9ne album)|''The Storm'']]. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]] on the song \"Sriracha\" and felt that it could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/joyner-lucas-logic-beef-everyday-struggle|title=Joyner Lucas Goes Into Detail About His Issues With Logic|last=Diep|first=Eric|date=December 6, 2017|work=Complex|access-date=}}</ref> Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on \"Sriracha\", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own track. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not \"too happy\" about him being on the track once he heard it.<ref name=\":1\" /> On his remix of [[Future (rapper)|Future]]'s \"[[Mask Off]]\", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both Joyner Lucas and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the same quick flow and serving up tired, lazy bars.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-vs-logic-beef-a-timeline-news.46408.html|title=Joyner Lucas Vs. Logic Beef: A Timeline|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter Logic's hit song \"[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]\" peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, ''508-507-2209''. With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen Logic dropped his song \"Yuck\" from his mixtape ''[[Bobby Tarantino II]]'' in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video]. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on [[Twitter]]. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song \"[[44 More]]\" and his album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' on his remix of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s \"[[Look Alive (BlocBoy JB song)|Look Alive]]\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song \"[[ISIS (Joyner Lucas song)|ISIS]]\", the third single from ''ADHD''. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|title=Joyner Lucas and Logic Squash Beef, Join Forces for New Song, Video \"ISIS\": Listen|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Hopsin ===\nIn September 2018, when a fan asked [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[Hopsin]] on [[Twitter]] who would win in a [[rap battle]] between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin implied that he was the better MC when he replied, \"That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to.\" Not long after, Lucas commented, \"Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|title=It Looks Like Hopsin and Joyner Lucas Are Beefing on Social Media|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> In his response, Hopsin stated that he would \"b[r]eak his soul\" and also dissed Logic in the comment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|title=Joyner Lucas Hopsin Beef - Logic Gets Dragged|last=LLC|first=Empire BBK|date=2018-09-24|website=Empire BBK|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a [[FaceTime]] call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|title=Hopsin & Joyner Lucas Squash Their Twitter \"Beef\"|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2018-09-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Tory Lanez ===\nJoyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist [[Tory Lanez]] began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an [[Instagram]] Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's \"Lucky You\", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over \"[[Litty]]\" by [[Meek Mill]] featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper [[Trippie Redd]], who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of \"Litty\", titled \"Litty Again\", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' [[answer song]] was a freestyle of [[Kodak Black]]'s \"[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]\". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending Lanez's song \"4am Flex\" was similar to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]]'s flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|title=Editorials: Tory Lanez and Joyner Lucas Lyrical Beef|last=Hotawardhiphop|date=2018-11-27|website=Hotawardhiphop  Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating.

Eventually, he would act out and get sent to an [[alternative school]] after expulsion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-announces-new-album-adhd-news.62031.html|title=Joyner Lucas Announces New Album \"ADHD\"|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2019|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adhd-joyner-lucas-identity-crisis-or-art-imitating-life-news.90843.html|title=ADHD: Joyner Lucas' Identity Crisis Or Art Imitating Life?|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Feuds ==\n=== Logic ===\nAccording to Lucas, when he was on [[Tech N9ne]] tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album [[The Storm (Tech N9ne album)|''The Storm'']]. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]] on the song \"Sriracha\" and felt that it could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/joyner-lucas-logic-beef-everyday-struggle|title=Joyner Lucas Goes Into Detail About His Issues With Logic|last=Diep|first=Eric|date=December 6, 2017|work=Complex|access-date=}}</ref> Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on \"Sriracha\", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own track. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not \"too happy\" about him being on the track once he heard it.<ref name=\":1\" /> On his remix of [[Future (rapper)|Future]]'s \"[[Mask Off]]\", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both Joyner Lucas and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the same quick flow and serving up tired, lazy bars.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-vs-logic-beef-a-timeline-news.46408.html|title=Joyner Lucas Vs. Logic Beef: A Timeline|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter Logic's hit song \"[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]\" peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, ''508-507-2209''. With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen Logic dropped his song \"Yuck\" from his mixtape ''[[Bobby Tarantino II]]'' in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video]. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on [[Twitter]]. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song \"[[44 More]]\" and his album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' on his remix of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s \"[[Look Alive (BlocBoy JB song)|Look Alive]]\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song \"[[ISIS (Joyner Lucas song)|ISIS]]\", the third single from ''ADHD''. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|title=Joyner Lucas and Logic Squash Beef, Join Forces for New Song, Video \"ISIS\": Listen|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Hopsin ===\nIn September 2018, when a fan asked [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[Hopsin]] on [[Twitter]] who would win in a [[rap battle]] between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin implied that he was the better MC when he replied, \"That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to.\" Not long after, Lucas commented, \"Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|title=It Looks Like Hopsin and Joyner Lucas Are Beefing on Social Media|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> In his response, Hopsin stated that he would \"b[r]eak his soul\" and also dissed Logic in the comment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|title=Joyner Lucas Hopsin Beef - Logic Gets Dragged|last=LLC|first=Empire BBK|date=2018-09-24|website=Empire BBK|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a [[FaceTime]] call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|title=Hopsin & Joyner Lucas Squash Their Twitter \"Beef\"|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2018-09-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Tory Lanez ===\nJoyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist [[Tory Lanez]] began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an [[Instagram]] Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's \"Lucky You\", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over \"[[Litty]]\" by [[Meek Mill]] featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper [[Trippie Redd]], who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of \"Litty\", titled \"Litty Again\", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' [[answer song]] was a freestyle of [[Kodak Black]]'s \"[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]\". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending Lanez's song \"4am Flex\" was similar to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]]'s flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|title=Editorials: Tory Lanez and Joyner Lucas Lyrical Beef|last=Hotawardhiphop|date=2018-11-27|website=Hotawardhiphop  Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating. Displeased, Lucas reposted the video with his own comment, with a reference to Lanez as a singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-declares-victory-in-feud-with-joyner-lucas|title=Tory Lanez Declares Victory In Feud With Joyner Lucas|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\nThe end of this rivalry was made public on August 8, 2019, when Joyner Lucas and Tory Lanez collaborated on their remix of \"[[Suge (song)|Suge]]\" by [[DaBaby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-and-joyner-lucas-take-competition-to-the-court-news.89120.html|title=Tory Lanez & Joyner Lucas Take Competition To The Court|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n===Grammy Awards===\nThe Grammy Awards are held annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]].

{"title_page": "Richard Burbage", "text_new": "{{short description|16th/17th-century English actor and theatre owner}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:RichardBurbage.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Richard Burbage'', [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], [[London]]]]\n\n'''Richard Burbage''' (c. 1567 &ndash; 13 March 1619) was an English stage actor, widely considered to have been one of the most famous actors of the [[Globe Theatre]] and of his time. In addition to being a stage [[actor]], he was also a theatre owner, entrepreneur, and painter. He was the younger brother of [[Cuthbert Burbage]]. They were both actors in drama. Burbage was a business associate and friend to [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThe son of [[James Burbage]], a [[joiner]] who became a theatrical impresario and entrepreneur, also founded the first theatre. Burbage was a popular actor by his early 20s. He excelled in plays with the theme of tragedies. His early acting career is poorly documented. As many young actors of his time, he may have played the part of women in productions before taking any of the roles he is known for. It has been suggested that he spent time working with the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]'s company, but there is no good evidence for this. He was probably acting with the [[Admiral's Men]] in 1590, with Lord Strange's Men in 1592, and with the Earl of Pembroke's Men in 1593; but most famously he was the star of William Shakespeare's theatre company, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] on the ascension of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603. He played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[King Lear]]''. But he was in great demand and also appeared in the plays of many of the great contemporary writers, such as [[Ben Jonson]] (the title role in ''[[Volpone]]'', and Subtle in ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''), [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] (''The Malcontent''), [[John Webster]] (''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'') and [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'').\n\nBurbage was described as being short and stout but was said to be an impressive figure, with numerous praises written of him in contemporary accounts. His power and scope as an actor is revealed in the sheer size of the roles he played. He was a great box office draw. Of the hundreds of plays and thousands of roles for actors that date from the 1580&ndash;1610 era, there are only twenty or so roles that are longer than 800 lines. [[Edward Alleyn]] was the first English actor to manage such roles, in [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' and ''[[The Jew of Malta]];'' but the majority of these star roles, thirteen of the twenty, were acted by Burbage.{{Sfn|McMillin|1987|pp=61\u20133}} He was said to be quite rich because he was earning income from being the primary housekeeping of two playhouses, a sharer in the King's Men, a lead actor and a painter.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Portrait of Richard Burbage (4673658) (cropped).jpg|thumb|19th century print of Richard Burbage]]\nBurbage was baptised at St Stephen in London on 7 July 1568. He was the second son of his parents, followed by three younger sisters; Alice, Joane, and Ellen. His father brought Burbage to the theatre and had the greatest influence on his career. Being the son of a builder and owner of the first successful permanent playhouse gave him a great starting advantage in the theatre world. It is said that because he worked in the theatre with his father at such a young age, he learned the basics of working with colours and the techniques of painting, which helped him later in life.<ref>https://is.muni.cz/th/216983/ff_b/BA_Thesis.pdf</ref>\n\nAfter the death of their father in February 1597, Richard and his brother Cuthbert stepped in to rescue the family's interests in two London theatres and found themselves tied up in lawsuits. They kept the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] but leased it to lawyer and impresario [[Henry Evans (theatre)|Henry Evans]], who used it for a troupe of child actors. The other, called simply [[The Theatre]], was dismantled when they could not resolve terms for a new lease with Giles Allen, the landowner. The beams, posts, and other remnants of The Theatre were moved to a new location on the south side of the Thames River and reassembled into a new playhouse called the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] in 1599. The Burbage brothers kept half the shares in the new theatre and gave the remainder to Shakespeare and other members of the Chamberlain's Men. Income from the Blackfriars lease helped fund the move to the Globe. In 1608 the brothers ended the Blackfriars lease and moved the company to the new theatre. Burbage was performing there on 29 June 1613, when it caught fire and burned down. During the winter months, when it was not practical to use the open-air Globe, they used the Blackfriars. It was much smaller and seated about 700 people.\n\nThe brothers maintained a close working and personal relationship throughout their lives; they were neighbours on Halliwell Street in [[Shoreditch]], near the Theatre. Burbage married Winifred Turner on 2 October 1600 at St Mary's, Rotherhithe. <ref>{{Cite article|title=Siobhan Keenan, \u2018New Evidence About Shakespearean \u201cStar\u201d Actor, Richard Burbage\u2019, Notes & Queries, June 2019}}</ref> Burbage fathered at least eight children;<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lfweG1MIOEC&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=richard+burbage+eight+children&source=bl&ots=6-uULU9AAS&sig=h2z4atP-JNgH8O_lIDNA5iMCv7g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU1afZzNHZAhVBy2MKHercB5kQ6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=richard%20burbage%20eight%20children&f=false|title=Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England|last=Barroll|first=Leeds|date=March 1996|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838636411|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424131052/https://books.google.com/books?id=-lfweG1MIOEC&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=richard+burbage+eight+children&source=bl&ots=6-uULU9AAS&sig=h2z4atP-JNgH8O_lIDNA5iMCv7g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU1afZzNHZAhVBy2MKHercB5kQ6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=richard%20burbage%20eight%20children&f=false|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> after his death his widow Winifred married another of the King's Men, [[Richard Robinson (17th-century actor)|Richard Robinson]].{{Sfn|Halliday|1964|p=77}} [See also: [[Nicholas Tooley]].]\n\nIt has sometimes been argued that the famous [[Chandos portrait]] of Shakespeare was painted by Burbage.

In addition to being a stage [[actor]], he was also a theatre owner, entrepreneur, and painter. He was the younger brother of [[Cuthbert Burbage]]. They were both actors in drama. Burbage was a business associate and friend to [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThe son of [[James Burbage]], a [[joiner]] who became a theatrical impresario and entrepreneur, also founded the first theatre. Burbage was a popular actor by his early 20s. He excelled in plays with the theme of tragedies. His early acting career is poorly documented. As many young actors of his time, he may have played the part of women in productions before taking any of the roles he is known for. It has been suggested that he spent time working with the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]'s company, but there is no good evidence for this. He was probably acting with the [[Admiral's Men]] in 1590, with Lord Strange's Men in 1592, and with the Earl of Pembroke's Men in 1593; but most famously he was the star of William Shakespeare's theatre company, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] on the ascension of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603. He played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[King Lear]]''. But he was in great demand and also appeared in the plays of many of the great contemporary writers, such as [[Ben Jonson]] (the title role in ''[[Volpone]]'', and Subtle in ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''), [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] (''The Malcontent''), [[John Webster]] (''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'') and [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'').\n\nBurbage was described as being short and stout but was said to be an impressive figure, with numerous praises written of him in contemporary accounts. His power and scope as an actor is revealed in the sheer size of the roles he played. He was a great box office draw. Of the hundreds of plays and thousands of roles for actors that date from the 1580&ndash;1610 era, there are only twenty or so roles that are longer than 800 lines. [[Edward Alleyn]] was the first English actor to manage such roles, in [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' and ''[[The Jew of Malta]];'' but the majority of these star roles, thirteen of the twenty, were acted by Burbage.{{Sfn|McMillin|1987|pp=61\u20133}} He was said to be quite rich because he was earning income from being the primary housekeeping of two playhouses, a sharer in the King's Men, a lead actor and a painter.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Portrait of Richard Burbage (4673658) (cropped).jpg|thumb|19th century print of Richard Burbage]]\nBurbage was baptised at St Stephen in London on 7 July 1568.

Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a [[steel]] backbone chassis, the Pantera's chassis was of a steel [[monocoque]] design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. The Pantera logo included a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching ancestors,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2010/04/01/hmn_feature16.html |title=De Tomaso: The Italian automaker's South American heritage is in its emblem|journal=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car|date=April 2010 |first=Craig |last=Fitzgerals|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> as well as a version of the Argentinean flag turned on its side, inspired by the company's founder, Alejandro De Tomaso, having been born and raised in Argentina.\n\n[[File:Detomaso Pantera Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior (1972 model)]]\nThe car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]] a few weeks later.<ref name=Motor197107/> Approximately a year later the first production cars were sold, and production was increased to three per day.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe slat-backed seats which had attracted criticism at the New York Auto Show were replaced by more conventional body-hugging sports seats in the production cars: leg-room was generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above approximately {{cvt|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name=Motor197107/> Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as electric windows, air conditioning and even \"doors that buzz when ... open\".<ref name=Motor197107/> By the time the Pantera reached production stage, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting an arm on the central console could lead to inadvertently activating the poorly located cigarette lighter.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe first 1971 Pantera models were powered by a {{convert|351|CID|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|''Ford Cleveland'' V8 engine]] having a power output of {{convert|335|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built offerings.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[transaxle]] used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more intrusive than the well restrained engine noise.<ref name=Motor197107/> Another Italian car that shares the ZF transaxle is the [[Maserati Bora]], also launched in 1971 although not yet available for sale.<ref name=Motor19710710>{{cite journal| first=Paul |last=Fr\u00e8re |title=Continental Diary....Up to now only two Bora have been built| journal =The Motor| volume = | pages=30\u201331|date =10 July 1971}}</ref> Power-assisted four-wheel [[disc brake]]s and [[rack and pinion]] steering were all standard equipment on the Pantera. The 1971 Pantera could accelerate to 97&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) in 5.5 seconds according to ''[[Car and Driver]]''.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, a visitor to the De Tomaso plant at [[Modena]] identified two different types of Pantera awaiting shipment, being respectively the European and American versions.<ref name=Motor197107>{{cite journal|first=Pete |last=Coltrin | title =Leave the Homburg at home: [Report of a visit to the de Tomaso plant]| journal=The Motor| volume = | pages=29|date=10 July 1971}}</ref> From outside, the principal differences were the larger tail lamps on the cars destined for America, along with addition of corner marker lamps.<ref name=Motor197107/> The visitor was impressed by the large number of cars awaiting shipment; in reality, spending the best part of a year under dust covers in a series of large hangars probably did nothing for the cash-flow of the business by the time they crossed the Atlantic. \n\n{{Listen\n |filename =De Tomaso Pantera (1974).ogg\n |title    =De Tomaso Pantera at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2010\n |type     =sound\n |style    =float:right;clear:none\n}}\n\n===In the United States===\n[[File:1973 DeTomaso Pantera (931878515).jpg|thumb|left|The 1973 De Tomaso Pantera L, with bigger \"safety bumpers\"]]\n[[File:1983 De Tomaso Pantera GTS (US market), front right.jpg|thumb|Pantera GTS (US model)]]\nLate in 1971, Ford began importing the Pantera for the American market to be sold through its [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] dealers. The first 75 cars were simply European imports and are known for their \"push-button\" door handles and hand-built [[Carrozzeria Vignale]] bodies. A total of 1,007 cars reached the United States that year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of [[body solder]] being used to cover body panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pantera International |url=http://panterainternational.org/detomaso_history/fords_pantera.html}}</ref> \n \nSeveral modifications were made to the Pantera for the 1972 model year. A new {{cvt|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[4 Bolt Main]] [[Cleveland Engine]], was used with lower [[compression ratio]] (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive \"Cobra Jet\" camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|428 Cobra Jet]]'s factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression ratio along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust header]].\n\nThe \"Lusso\" (luxury) '''Pantera L''' was also introduced in August 1972 as a 1972\u00bd model. For the US market, it featured a large black single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate bumperettes still used abroad, as well as the Cleveland engine now having a power output of {{cvt|266|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The \"L\" model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year beating offerings from Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dashboard was changed, deviating from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version of the 1974 '''Pantera GTS''' featured optional GTS badging but not the higher compression, solid lifter engine of its European GTS \"cousin\".\n\n=== Disengagement of Ford ===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GT5.jpg|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera GT5]]\nFord stopped importing the Pantera to the US in 1975, having sold around 5,500 cars. De Tomaso continued to build the car in ever-escalating forms of performance and luxury for almost two decades for sale in the rest of the world. A small number of cars were imported to the US by [[Grey import vehicles|gray market]] importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. After 1974, Ford discontinued the Cleveland 351 engine, but production continued in Australia until 1982. De Tomaso started sourcing their engines from Australia once the American supplies stopped. These engines were tuned in Switzerland and were available with a range of outputs up to {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AK87\">{{cite book|title=Auto Katalog 1987|publisher=[[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Production of the wide body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 252 GT5 Pantera models were likely to have been built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's bolted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for \"steel\". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built. Concurrent GTS production continued, on a custom order and very limited basis, until the late 1980s.\n\nThe car continued to use a Ford V8 engine, although in 1988, when the supply of Ford 351 Cleveland engines from Australia ran out, De Tomaso began installing [[Ford small block engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor engines]] in the Pantera instead. In all, about 7,200 cars in total were built.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Pantera Si==\n[[File:1990 De Tomaso Pantera Si.jpg|thumb|DeTomaso Pantera Si]]\nFor 1990 the 351 engine was replaced by the Ford 302 engine {{cvt|302|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine and the Pantera received new styling penned by [[Marcello Gandini]], suspension redesign and a partial chassis redesign. The new model was called the Pantera 90 Si and it was introduced in 1990. Only 38 90 Si models were sold before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical [[De Tomaso Guar\u00e0|Guar\u00e0]]. Some sources state that 41 were built (with the last one not finished until 1996), of which four were targa models. The targas were converted by Pavesi directly off the production lines. In the UK, the model was sold as Pantera 90.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Series II Front.jpg|thumb|right|A one-off second generation Pantera prototype made by [[Ghia]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com/2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2008/cars/others/de_tomaso/05/villa_deste/0205.html|date=2008-03-05 |title=Long Forgotten Pantera Prototype Resurfaces at Villa d'Este|accessdate=2008-07-18|work=italiaspeed.com/2008}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Model year]]\n!Specification data\n!1971 L<ref name=\"1971L\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1971/695495/de_tomaso_pantera.html\n|title=1971 De Tomaso Pantera L\n|website=automobile-catalog.com\n|editor=Pawel Zal\n|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}</ref>\n!1988 GT5 S <ref name=\"GT5S\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1988/695810/de_tomaso_pantera_gt5s.html|title=1988 De Tomaso Pantera GT5 S (man. 5) specifications|website=automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Engine configuration]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |{{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Naturally aspirated]] [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|Ford Cleveland V8]]\n|-\n|Fuel system\n|[[Autolite]] 4-barrel [[carburetor]]\n|[[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 4-barrel carburetor\n|-\n|[[Curb weight]]\n|{{convert|3123|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|3250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Wheelbase]]\n|{{convert|98.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|98.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front track\n|{{convert|57.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|59.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear track\n|{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|62.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Length\n|{{convert|158.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|168.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width\n|{{convert|67.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|77.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height\n|{{convert|43.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|43.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Brake]]s\n|Front: {{convert|279|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated;<br/>Rear: {{convert|302|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1974-detomaso-pantera-l/\n|website=Supercars.net\n|title=1974 De Tomaso Pantera L}}</ref>\n|Front: {{convert|284|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated;<br/>Rear: {{convert|297|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1985-detomaso-pantera-gt5-s/\n|website=Supercars.net\n|title=1985 De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S}}</ref>\n|-\n|Power\n|{{convert|326|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm\n|{{convert|350|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm\n|-\n|Torque\n|{{convert|466|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,500 rpm\n|{{convert|451|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,800 rpm\n|-\n|Fuel economy\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Highway (Extra-urban): {{convert|14.6|mpgus|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"1971L\"/><ref name=\"GT5S\"/><ref name=\"Willson2\">{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1995|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref>\n|-\n|Compression ratio\n|11.0:1\n|9.5:1\n|-\n|Gearbox\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[manual transmission]]\n|-\n|Maximum speed\n|{{convert|159|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Willson2\" />\n|{{convert|174|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"GT5S\"/>\n|}\n\n==Motorsports==\n===Group 3===\n[[File:Paris - Bonhams 2014 - De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 - 1972 - 001.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 3 prototype]]\n\nDe Tomaso offered a Pantera competition car built to special order according to the Group 3 class racing rules between 1972 and 1984 based on the Pantera GTS. 30 cars were built for private customer teams. Group 3 rules were very strict and allowed little modifications to the original road going production cars. Earlier Group 3 cars are infamously called \"push button\" chassis cars as they were built by hand because De Tomaso didn't have a proper assembly line when the Pantera began production. Special equipment of the Group 3 cars included Campagnolo wheels (15 x 8 inches at the front and 15 x 10 inches at the rear), adjustable Koni shocks, racing brakes and special safety equipment required at the time: plexi-glass windows with cutouts, a roll bar, fire extinguisher and racing bucket seats. The engine modifications included a reinforced camshaft, a 10-litre oil pan and a Holley racing 4 barrel carburetor. Displacement of the engine was also enlarged to 5.8-litres. The engine had a power output of {{cvt|336|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was mated to a 5-speed close ratio gearbox with a heavy duty single plate clutch and a limited slip differential. It was reported that with the long ratio gears, the Group 3 cars could achieve a top speed up to {{cvt|280|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The Group 3 cars were so competitive that this prompted Porsche to speed up development of the more powerful 911 Carrera RS and Carrera RSR race cars. The use of racing brakes for the Pantera Group 3 was not allowed until 1975 and the car competed with the brakes of the road legal Pantera which proved to be its weak point. Due to an accident in 1973 at the Charade circuit, reinforced hubs developed by De Tomaso for the Group 3 car were approved in Group 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17043/lot/136/?category=list|title=1973 DE TOMASO PANTERA GP3, 1973 De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 Coup\u00e9 Chassis no. 2006|date=2009-02-07|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://detomasodc.co.uk/pantera-gts|title=Pantera GTS|work=De Tomaso Driver's Club|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 4===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 Gen1 000 1972 frontleft 2013-03-17 U.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 competition car]]\n\nAfter the Pantera had begun production, De Tomaso introduced a motorsport oriented Group 3 version of the car. This was followed by a modified Group 4 version in 1972. British engineer and driver Mike Parkes, who had previously developed racing cars for Ferrari was tasked with the development of the new car.\n\nAs per the regulations, the Group 4 car was based around the road car's steel monocoque chassis. The double wishbone suspension was substantially modified and Koni adjustable shocks were used in order to improve handling at the track and make room for wider Campagnolo wheels and tyres. Bigger ventilated brakes supplied by Girling and a quick ratio steering rack were used to refine handling and stopping power. The standard steel body shell of the Pantera also received modifications such as aluminium doors, front lid and engine cover along with flared fibre glass wheel arches in order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres. Plexi glass windows were used throughout and holes were cut into the chassis where possible in order to reduce weight. The car had no front or rear bumpers and a front deep chin spoiler. It also didn't had any rustproofing and interior amenities. The interior was fitted with a cut-off switch instead of a radio, light weight cloth bucket racing seats, a vinyl trim, a roll-cage and drilled aluminium pedals. The final car had a weight of {{cvt|1100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFord, providing a good amount of financial backing in the development of the road going Pantera had little interest in the motorsport version of the car and refused to supply engines for the Group 4 Pantera. De Tomaso engaged a private US based engine builder Bud Moore to supply engines for the car.\n\nBased on the same Ford 351 Cleveland V8 engine used in the road going Pantera, the engine in the Group 4 Pantera was fitted with bespoke aluminium heads, TRW forged pistons, large capacity oil pans and titanium valves. Initially, a single Holley Racing 1150 CFM four barrel carburetor was fitted but this was replaced by four Weber carburetors and a revised intake. The engine had a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1. Displacement of the racing engine was unchanged from road going Pantera's engine. The \"spaghetti\" styled exhaust system similar to the one used in the [[Ford GT40]] was used. The engine had a claimed power output of {{cvt|507|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the cars ran at a power output of {{cvt|446|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm which was increased to {{cvt|477|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when the Weber 850 CFM carburetors were used. The engine was mated to a ZF 5-speed close ratio manual transmission with a heavy duty single clutch plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janluehn.com/cars/1974-de-tomaso-pantera-group-4|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|publisher=Jan B Leuhn|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\nThe first Group 4 Panteras were entered into the 1972 24 Hours of LeMans. The problems of the car then began to become apparent. The engine proved to be unreliable and the car was also subject to a weight penalty, increasing the weight to {{cvt|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. This was set reportedly high due to [[Porsche]]'s influence over the governing body of the race. Another problem of the car was the rigidity of its chassis. Nevertheless, the car continued to compete in Group 4 and the engine problem was addressed by sourcing replacement engines with a lower compression ratio. A total of 14 Group 4 cars were made. Some Group 3 cars were modified to Group 4 specifications by privateers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6263/2/DeTomaso-Pantera-Group-4.html|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|date=2015-06-17|first=Wouter|last=Melissen|publisher=Ultimate Car Page|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 5===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Mallory Park.JPG|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera Group 5 competition car]]\n\nThe Group 5 Pantera race cars were converted by private racing teams from Group 4 and Group 3 cars and competed in Group 5 class racing from 1976 to 1981. The Group 5 cars only had wider body panels and no significant design, mechanical and chassis modifications.\n\nHowever, two cars were extensively modified to compete in the IMSA GTX and Group 5 class respectively. The first car having chassis number #001 was constructed from a new chassis by Italian racing team Sala and Marveti. The second car, having chassis number #1603 was a Group 4 car campaigned by Hugh Kleinpeter in the US and then underwent modification. Afterwards, the former was converted to Group C class specifications in 1983 and the latter was converted to IMSA GTP class specifications respectively. Both cars were uncompetitive in their categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gr5pantera.com/gr-5-panteras|title=Gr 5 Panteras, 1976 - 1981|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AMC AMX#AMX/3]] - first shown a month earlier, and sometimes confused with.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|De Tomaso Pantera}}\n* (August, 1971) ''[[Car and Driver]]''\n* [http://www.poca.com Pantera Owners Club of America]\n* [http://www.DeTomasoRegistry.org The DeTomaso Registry]\n* [http://carplusautoblog.com/de-tomaso-pantera-the-top-speed-car/ Tomaso Pantera Review]\n\n{{De Tomaso}}\n\n[[Category:De Tomaso vehicles|Pantera]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1970]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|mid-engine sports car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer De Tomaso from 1971 to 1992}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = De Tomaso Pantera\n| image = De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S (7160836758).jpg\n| caption = De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S\n| manufacturer = [[De Tomaso|De Tomaso Automobili]]\n| assembly = Italy: [[Modena]]<ref name=\"danjedlicka.com\">1971-74 DeTomaso Pantera History by Dan Jedlicka: [http://www.danjedlicka.com/classic_cars/1971_74_detomaso_pantera.html 1971-74 DeTomaso Pantera History by Dan Jedlicka], accessdate: 8.

Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a [[steel]] backbone chassis, the Pantera's chassis was of a steel [[monocoque]] design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. The Pantera logo included a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching ancestors,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2010/04/01/hmn_feature16.html |title=De Tomaso: The Italian automaker's South American heritage is in its emblem|journal=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car|date=April 2010 |first=Craig |last=Fitzgerals|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> as well as a version of the Argentinean flag turned on its side, inspired by the company's founder, Alejandro De Tomaso, having been born and raised in Argentina.\n\n[[File:Detomaso Pantera Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior (1972 model)]]\nThe car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]] a few weeks later.<ref name=Motor197107/> Approximately a year later the first production cars were sold, and production was increased to three per day.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe slat-backed seats which had attracted criticism at the New York Auto Show were replaced by more conventional body-hugging sports seats in the production cars: leg-room was generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above approximately {{cvt|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name=Motor197107/> Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as electric windows, air conditioning and even \"doors that buzz when ... open\".<ref name=Motor197107/> By the time the Pantera reached production stage, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting an arm on the central console could lead to inadvertently activating the poorly located cigarette lighter.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe first 1971 Pantera models were powered by a {{convert|351|CID|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|''Ford Cleveland'' V8 engine]] having a power output of {{convert|335|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built offerings.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[transaxle]] used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more intrusive than the well restrained engine noise.<ref name=Motor197107/> Another Italian car that shares the ZF transaxle is the [[Maserati Bora]], also launched in 1971 although not yet available for sale.<ref name=Motor19710710>{{cite journal| first=Paul |last=Fr\u00e8re |title=Continental Diary....Up to now only two Bora have been built| journal =The Motor| volume = | pages=30\u201331|date =10 July 1971}}</ref> Power-assisted four-wheel [[disc brake]]s and [[rack and pinion]] steering were all standard equipment on the Pantera.

The first 75 cars were simply European imports and are known for their \"push-button\" door handles and hand-built [[Carrozzeria Vignale]] bodies. A total of 1,007 cars reached the United States that year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of [[body solder]] being used to cover body panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pantera International |url=http://panterainternational.org/detomaso_history/fords_pantera.html}}</ref> \n \nSeveral modifications were made to the Pantera for the 1972 model year. A new {{cvt|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[4 Bolt Main]] [[Cleveland Engine]], was used with lower [[compression ratio]] (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive \"Cobra Jet\" camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|428 Cobra Jet]]'s factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression ratio along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust header]].\n\nThe \"Lusso\" (luxury) '''Pantera L''' was also introduced in August 1972 as a 1972\u00bd model. For the US market, it featured a large black single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate bumperettes still used abroad, as well as the Cleveland engine now having a power output of {{cvt|266|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The \"L\" model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year beating offerings from Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dashboard was changed, deviating from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version of the 1974 '''Pantera GTS''' featured optional GTS badging but not the higher compression, solid lifter engine of its European GTS \"cousin\".\n\n=== Disengagement of Ford ===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GT5.jpg|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera GT5]]\nFord stopped importing the Pantera to the US in 1975, having sold around 5,500 cars. De Tomaso continued to build the car in ever-escalating forms of performance and luxury for almost two decades for sale in the rest of the world. A small number of cars were imported to the US by [[Grey import vehicles|gray market]] importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. After 1974, Ford discontinued the Cleveland 351 engine, but production continued in Australia until 1982. De Tomaso started sourcing their engines from Australia once the American supplies stopped. These engines were tuned in Switzerland and were available with a range of outputs up to {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AK87\">{{cite book|title=Auto Katalog 1987|publisher=[[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Production of the wide body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 252 GT5 Pantera models were likely to have been built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's bolted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for \"steel\". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built. Concurrent GTS production continued, on a custom order and very limited basis, until the late 1980s.\n\nThe car continued to use a Ford V8 engine, although in 1988, when the supply of Ford 351 Cleveland engines from Australia ran out, De Tomaso began installing [[Ford small block engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor engines]] in the Pantera instead. In all, about 7,200 cars in total were built.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Pantera Si==\n[[File:1990 De Tomaso Pantera Si.jpg|thumb|DeTomaso Pantera Si]]\nFor 1990 the 351 engine was replaced by the Ford 302 engine {{cvt|302|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine and the Pantera received new styling penned by [[Marcello Gandini]], suspension redesign and a partial chassis redesign. The new model was called the Pantera 90 Si and it was introduced in 1990. Only 38 90 Si models were sold before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical [[De Tomaso Guar\u00e0|Guar\u00e0]]. Some sources state that 41 were built (with the last one not finished until 1996), of which four were targa models. The targas were converted by Pavesi directly off the production lines. In the UK, the model was sold as Pantera 90.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Series II Front.jpg|thumb|right|A one-off second generation Pantera prototype made by [[Ghia]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com/2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2008/cars/others/de_tomaso/05/villa_deste/0205.html|date=2008-03-05 |title=Long Forgotten Pantera Prototype Resurfaces at Villa d'Este|accessdate=2008-07-18|work=italiaspeed.com/2008}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Model year]]\n!Specification data\n!1971 L<ref name=\"1971L\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1971/695495/de_tomaso_pantera.html\n|title=1971 De Tomaso Pantera L\n|website=automobile-catalog.com\n|editor=Pawel Zal\n|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}</ref>\n!1988 GT5 S <ref name=\"GT5S\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1988/695810/de_tomaso_pantera_gt5s.html|title=1988 De Tomaso Pantera GT5 S (man. 5) specifications|website=automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Engine configuration]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |{{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Naturally aspirated]] [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|Ford Cleveland V8]]\n|-\n|Fuel system\n|[[Autolite]] 4-barrel [[carburetor]]\n|[[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 4-barrel carburetor\n|-\n|[[Curb weight]]\n|{{convert|3123|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|3250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Wheelbase]]\n|{{convert|98.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|98.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front track\n|{{convert|57.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|59.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear track\n|{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|62.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Length\n|{{convert|158.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|168.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width\n|{{convert|67.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|77.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height\n|{{convert|43.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|43.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Brake]]s\n|Front: 332 x 32 [[ventilated disc brake|ventilated discs]] and cross-drilled;<br/>Rear: 314 x 28 ventilated<br/>(1971 models had 15-inch wheels and brake rotors were smaller than {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}})\n|Front: {{convert|284|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated;<br/>Rear: {{convert|297|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1985-detomaso-pantera-gt5-s/\n|website=Supercars.net\n|title=1985 De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S}}</ref>\n|-\n|Power\n|{{convert|326|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm\n|{{convert|350|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm\n|-\n|Torque\n|{{convert|466|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,500 rpm\n|{{convert|451|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,800 rpm\n|-\n|Fuel economy\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Highway (Extra-urban): {{convert|14.6|mpgus|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"1971L\"/><ref name=\"GT5S\"/><ref name=\"Willson2\">{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1995|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref>\n|-\n|Compression ratio\n|11.0:1\n|9.5:1\n|-\n|Gearbox\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[manual transmission]]\n|-\n|Maximum speed\n|{{convert|159|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Willson2\" />\n|{{convert|174|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"GT5S\"/>\n|}\n\n==Motorsports==\n===Group 3===\n[[File:Paris - Bonhams 2014 - De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 - 1972 - 001.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 3 prototype]]\n\nDe Tomaso offered a Pantera competition car built to special order according to the Group 3 class racing rules between 1972 and 1984 based on the Pantera GTS. 30 cars were built for private customer teams. Group 3 rules were very strict and allowed little modifications to the original road going production cars. Earlier Group 3 cars are infamously called \"push button\" chassis cars as they were built by hand because De Tomaso didn't have a proper assembly line when the Pantera began production. Special equipment of the Group 3 cars included Campagnolo wheels (15 x 8 inches at the front and 15 x 10 inches at the rear), adjustable Koni shocks, racing brakes and special safety equipment required at the time: plexi-glass windows with cutouts, a roll bar, fire extinguisher and racing bucket seats. The engine modifications included a reinforced camshaft, a 10-litre oil pan and a Holley racing 4 barrel carburetor. Displacement of the engine was also enlarged to 5.8-litres. The engine had a power output of {{cvt|336|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was mated to a 5-speed close ratio gearbox with a heavy duty single plate clutch and a limited slip differential. It was reported that with the long ratio gears, the Group 3 cars could achieve a top speed up to {{cvt|280|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The Group 3 cars were so competitive that this prompted Porsche to speed up development of the more powerful 911 Carrera RS and Carrera RSR race cars. The use of racing brakes for the Pantera Group 3 was not allowed until 1975 and the car competed with the brakes of the road legal Pantera which proved to be its weak point. Due to an accident in 1973 at the Charade circuit, reinforced hubs developed by De Tomaso for the Group 3 car were approved in Group 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17043/lot/136/?category=list|title=1973 DE TOMASO PANTERA GP3, 1973 De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 Coup\u00e9 Chassis no. 2006|date=2009-02-07|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://detomasodc.co.uk/pantera-gts|title=Pantera GTS|work=De Tomaso Driver's Club|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 4===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 Gen1 000 1972 frontleft 2013-03-17 U.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 competition car]]\n\nAfter the Pantera had begun production, De Tomaso introduced a motorsport oriented Group 3 version of the car. This was followed by a modified Group 4 version in 1972. British engineer and driver Mike Parkes, who had previously developed racing cars for Ferrari was tasked with the development of the new car.\n\nAs per the regulations, the Group 4 car was based around the road car's steel monocoque chassis. The double wishbone suspension was substantially modified and Koni adjustable shocks were used in order to improve handling at the track and make room for wider Campagnolo wheels and tyres. Bigger ventilated brakes supplied by Girling and a quick ratio steering rack were used to refine handling and stopping power. The standard steel body shell of the Pantera also received modifications such as aluminium doors, front lid and engine cover along with flared fibre glass wheel arches in order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres. Plexi glass windows were used throughout and holes were cut into the chassis where possible in order to reduce weight. The car had no front or rear bumpers and a front deep chin spoiler. It also didn't had any rustproofing and interior amenities. The interior was fitted with a cut-off switch instead of a radio, light weight cloth bucket racing seats, a vinyl trim, a roll-cage and drilled aluminium pedals. The final car had a weight of {{cvt|1100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFord, providing a good amount of financial backing in the development of the road going Pantera had little interest in the motorsport version of the car and refused to supply engines for the Group 4 Pantera. De Tomaso engaged a private US based engine builder Bud Moore to supply engines for the car.\n\nBased on the same Ford 351 Cleveland V8 engine used in the road going Pantera, the engine in the Group 4 Pantera was fitted with bespoke aluminium heads, TRW forged pistons, large capacity oil pans and titanium valves. Initially, a single Holley Racing 1150 CFM four barrel carburetor was fitted but this was replaced by four Weber carburetors and a revised intake. The engine had a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1. Displacement of the racing engine was unchanged from road going Pantera's engine. The \"spaghetti\" styled exhaust system similar to the one used in the [[Ford GT40]] was used. The engine had a claimed power output of {{cvt|507|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the cars ran at a power output of {{cvt|446|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm which was increased to {{cvt|477|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when the Weber 850 CFM carburetors were used. The engine was mated to a ZF 5-speed close ratio manual transmission with a heavy duty single clutch plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janluehn.com/cars/1974-de-tomaso-pantera-group-4|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|publisher=Jan B Leuhn|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\nThe first Group 4 Panteras were entered into the 1972 24 Hours of LeMans. The problems of the car then began to become apparent. The engine proved to be unreliable and the car was also subject to a weight penalty, increasing the weight to {{cvt|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. This was set reportedly high due to [[Porsche]]'s influence over the governing body of the race. Another problem of the car was the rigidity of its chassis. Nevertheless, the car continued to compete in Group 4 and the engine problem was addressed by sourcing replacement engines with a lower compression ratio. A total of 14 Group 4 cars were made. Some Group 3 cars were modified to Group 4 specifications by privateers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6263/2/DeTomaso-Pantera-Group-4.html|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|date=2015-06-17|first=Wouter|last=Melissen|publisher=Ultimate Car Page|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 5===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Mallory Park.JPG|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera Group 5 competition car]]\n\nThe Group 5 Pantera race cars were converted by private racing teams from Group 4 and Group 3 cars and competed in Group 5 class racing from 1976 to 1981. The Group 5 cars only had wider body panels and no significant design, mechanical and chassis modifications.\n\nHowever, two cars were extensively modified to compete in the IMSA GTX and Group 5 class respectively. The first car having chassis number #001 was constructed from a new chassis by Italian racing team Sala and Marveti. The second car, having chassis number #1603 was a Group 4 car campaigned by Hugh Kleinpeter in the US and then underwent modification. Afterwards, the former was converted to Group C class specifications in 1983 and the latter was converted to IMSA GTP class specifications respectively. Both cars were uncompetitive in their categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gr5pantera.com/gr-5-panteras|title=Gr 5 Panteras, 1976 - 1981|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AMC AMX#AMX/3]] - first shown a month earlier, and sometimes confused with.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|De Tomaso Pantera}}\n* (August, 1971) ''[[Car and Driver]]''\n* [http://www.poca.com Pantera Owners Club of America]\n* [http://www.DeTomasoRegistry.org The DeTomaso Registry]\n* [http://carplusautoblog.com/de-tomaso-pantera-the-top-speed-car/ Tomaso Pantera Review]\n\n{{De Tomaso}}\n\n[[Category:De Tomaso vehicles|Pantera]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1970]]\n", "name_user": "Amagi82", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix brake sizes for 1970s era", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Tomaso_Pantera"}

Whilst part of it can be managed; however, some of it is beyond the ability of the operator or manufacturers to eliminate.\n\nIn order of importance, the three ways a firearm generates sound are:\n*Muzzle blast \u2014 [[shockwave]] generated by high-pressure gases escaping and expanding from the muzzle after the [[projectile]] exits the barrel and breaks the functional [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] restraining the gas inside the [[gun barrel#Bore|bore]]\n*[[Sonic boom]] \u2014 sharp [[bullwhip]]-cracking sound associated with high-frequency shockwaves caused by an object (in this case, the [[bullet]]) flying [[supersonic]]ally through the air\n*Mechanical noise generated by the internal moving parts of the [[firearm action]]\n\nA silencer can only affect the noise generated by the muzzle blast.  While using [[subsonic ammunition]]s can negate the sonic boom, mechanical noise can be mitigated but is nearly impossible to eliminate.  For these reasons, it is difficult to completely silence any firearm, or achieve an acceptable{{clarify|date=June 2018}} level of noise suppression in [[revolver]]s that function under standard operating principles due to the looser gas seal between the barrel and the [[cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]].  Some revolvers have technical features that enable suppression and include the Russian [[Nagant M1895]] and [[OTs-38]] revolvers, and the [[S&W QSPR]].\n\n[[Muzzle blast]] generated by firearm discharge is directly proportional to the amount of [[propellant]] to be combusted within the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].  Therefore, the greater the case capacity (e.g. a [[magnum cartridge]]), the louder the muzzle blast and consequently a more efficient or larger silencer system is required.  A gunshot (the combination of the sonic boom, the vacuum release, and hot gases) will almost always be louder than the sound of the action cycling of an [[semi-automatic firearm|autoloading firearm]].  Alan C. Paulson, a renowned firearms specialist, claimed to have encountered an integrally suppressed .22 LR gun that had such a quiet report {{clarify|date=August 2019}} ,<ref name=\"Paulson\"/> although this is somewhat uncommon.  Properly evaluating the sound generated by a firearm can only be done using a [[Decibel Meters|decibel meter]] in conjunction with a [[frequency spectrum]] analyzer during live tests.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:ReflexSuppressor-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a centerfire rifle silencer, showing expansion chamber \"reflexed\" (going back around) the rifle barrel, and four sound baffles. The diffractor and baffles are carefully shaped to deflect gas.|alt=]]\n[[File:Vaime-Suppressor-22-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a rimfire rifle silencer, showing short expansion chamber and thirteen plastic baffles. These baffles use alternating angled flat surfaces to repeatedly deflect gas expanding through the silencer. In the actual silencer, the baffles are oriented at 90 degrees to each other about the axis of bullet travel. (The illustration cannot demonstrate this well.)]]\n[[File:Navy-HushPuppy-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a pistol silencer, showing expansion chamber wrapped around inner suppressor assembly, and four wipes. The bullet pushes a bullet-diameter hole through the wipes, trapping propellant gas behind it entirely until the bullet has passed through the wipe completely]]\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|Cross section drawing of an \"integral\" sound suppressor in part designed and built into the suppressed firearm.]]\n\nThe silencer is typically a hollow metal tube manufactured from [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]] and contains expansion chambers. This device, typically cylindrical in shape, attaches to the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a [[pistol]], [[submachine gun]], or [[rifle]]. Some \"can\"-type silencers (so-called as they often resemble a [[beverage can]]) may be detached by the user and attached to a different firearm. Another type is the \"integral\" suppressor, which typically consists of an expansion chamber or chambers surrounding the barrel. The barrel has openings or \"ports\" which bleed off gases into the chambers. This type of silencer is part of the firearm (thus the term \"integral\"), and maintenance of the suppressor requires that the firearm be at least partially disassembled.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Huntertown Kestrel 5.56 disassembled.JPG|thumb|left|Firearm suppressor disassembled to show blast chamber, baffles, and sections of the outer tube]]\n\nBoth types of silencers reduce noise by allowing the rapidly expanding gases from the firing of the cartridge to be decelerated and cooled through a series of hollow chambers. The trapped gas exits the suppressor over a longer period of time and at a greatly reduced speed, producing less noise signature. The chambers are divided by either ''baffles'' or ''wipes''. There are typically at least four and up to perhaps fifteen chambers in a suppressor, depending on the intended use and design details. Often, a single, larger expansion chamber is located at the muzzle end of a can-type silencer, which allows the propellant gas to expand considerably and slow down before it encounters the baffles or wipes. This larger chamber may be \"reflexed\" toward the rear of the barrel to minimize the overall length of the combined firearm and silencer, especially with longer weapons such as rifles.\n\nSilencers vary greatly in size and efficiency. One disposable type developed in the 1980s by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for [[9\u00d719mm]] pistols was {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} in outside diameter, and was designed for six shots with standard ammunition or up to thirty shots with [[speed of sound|subsonic]] (slower than the speed of sound) [[ammunition]]. In contrast, one suppressor designed for rifles firing the powerful [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber (BMG)]] cartridge is {{convert|509|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Barrett\"/>\n\nTwo ancillary advantages to the silencer are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash is reduced by both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of propellant gasses, which can contribute 30\u201350% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the propellant gasses. This can cause them to function somewhat like a [[muzzle booster]] and thus increase the felt recoil. The weight of the silencer and the location of that additional weight at the muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due to the location of this mass.\n\n===Components===\n\n===Baffles and spacers===\nBaffles are usually circular metal dividers which separate the expansion chambers. Each baffle has a hole in its center to permit the passage of the bullet through the silencer and toward the target. The hole is typically at least 1&nbsp;mm larger than the bullet caliber to minimize the risk of the bullet hitting the baffle in what is known as a \"baffle strike\". Baffles are typically made of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, or alloys such as [[Inconel]], and are either [[machining|machined]] out of solid metal or [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] out of sheet metal. A few silencers for low-powered cartridges such as the [[.22 Long Rifle]] have successfully used plastic baffles (certain models by Vaime and others).<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|186\u2013187}}\n\nThere are several unique baffle designs. M, K, Z, monolithic core<ref name=\"Sparrow\"/> and \u03a9 (Omega) are the most prevalent. M-type is the crudest and comprises an inverted [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. K forms slanted obstructions diverging from the sidewalls, creating [[turbulence]] across the [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]line. Z is expensive to machine and includes \"pockets\" of dead airspace along the sidewalls which trap expanded gases and hold them thereby lengthening the time that the gases cool before exiting. Omega-type baffles form a series of spaced cones drawing gas away from the boreline and incorporate a scalloped mouth creating cross-bore turbulence, which is in turn directed to a \"mouse-hole\" opening between the baffle stack and sidewall.\n\nPropellant gas heats and erodes the baffles, causing wear, which is worsened by high rates of fire. Aluminum baffles are seldom used with fully [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]]s, because service life is unacceptably short. Some modern suppressors using steel or high-temperature alloy baffles can endure extended periods of fully automatic fire without damage. The highest-quality rifle suppressors available today have a claimed service life of greater than 30,000 rounds.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|363\u2013364}} Baffles have not been given any specific angles, a specific size, or weight to meet any standards; they are created on a trial and error basis.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nSpacers separate baffles and keep them aligned at a specified distance from each other inside the silencer. Many baffles and spacers are manufactured as a single assembly and several suppressor designs have all the baffles attached together with spacers as a one-piece helical baffle stack. Modern baffles are usually carefully shaped to divert the propellant gases effectively into the chambers. This shaping can be a slanted flat surface, canted at an angle to the bore, or a conical or otherwise curved surface. One popular technique is to have alternating angled surfaces through the stack of baffles.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n===Wipes and packing material===\nWipes are inner dividers intended to touch the bullet as it passes through the silencer, and are typically made of [[rubber]], [[plastic]], or [[foam]]. Each wipe may either have a hole drilled in it before use, a pattern stamped into its surface at the point where the bullet will strike it, or it may simply be punched through by the bullet. Wipes typically last for a small number of firings (perhaps no more than five) before their performance is significantly degraded. While many suppressors used wipes in the [[Vietnam War]] era, most modern suppressors do not use them as anything that touches the projectile has significant accuracy implications. All \"wipes\" deteriorate quickly and require disassembly and spare parts replacement.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/>\n\n\"Wet\" silencers or \"wet cans\" use a small quantity of water, [[oil]], [[petroleum|grease]], or [[gel]] in the expansion chambers to cool the propellant gases and reduce their volume (see [[ideal gas law]]). The coolant lasts only a few shots before it must be replenished, but can greatly increase the effectiveness of the suppressor. Water is most effective, due to its high [[heat of vaporization]], but it can run or evaporate out of the silencer. Grease, while messier and less effective than water, can be left in the suppressor indefinitely without losing effectiveness. Oil is the least effective and least preferable, as it runs while being as messy as grease, and leaves behind a fine mist of [[aerosol]]ized oil after each shot. Water-based gels, such as wire-pulling lubricant gel, are a good compromise; they offer the efficacy of water with less mess, as they do not run or drip. However, they take longer to apply, as they must be cleared from the bore of the suppressor to ensure a clear path for the bullet (grease requires this step as well). Generally, only pistol silencers are shot wet, as rifle silencers handle such high pressure and heat that the liquid is gone within 1\u20133 shots. Many manufacturers will not warranty their rifle suppressors for \"wet\" fire, as some feel this may even result in a dangerous over-pressurization of the silencer.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nPacking materials such as metal [[mesh]], [[steel wool]], or [[washer (hardware)|metal washers]] may be used to fill the chambers and further dissipate and cool the gases. These are somewhat more effective than empty chambers, but less effective than wet designs.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|130}} Metal mesh, if properly used, may last for hundreds or thousands of shots of spaced semi-automatic fire; however, steel wool usually degrades within ten shots, with stainless steel wool lasting longer than regular steel wool. Like wipes, packing materials are rarely found in modern silencers.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nWipes, packing materials and purpose-designed wet cans have been generally abandoned in 21st-century suppressor design because they decrease overall accuracy and require excessive cleaning and maintenance.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> The instructions from several manufacturers state that their suppressors need not be cleaned at all.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Which manufacturers?

These types of silencers are mostly used on handguns and rifles chambered in .22LR. More powerful rifles may use this type of attachment, but harsh recoil may cause the suppressor to over-tighten to the barrel and the suppressor can become difficult to remove.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> [[SilencerCo]]'s Salvo silencer for shotguns attaches via internal barrel threading normally used to mount removable [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]].<ref>Waldron, Len. \"SilencerCo Salvo 12 Gauge Suppressor Review.\" ''Guns &''\n Ammo''.

In these designs, effects known as [[frequency shifting]] and [[interference (wave propagation)|phase cancellation]] (or destructive interference) are used in an attempt to make the suppressor quieter. These effects are achieved by separating the flow of gases and causing them to collide with each other or by venting them through precision-made holes. The intended effect of frequency shifting is to shift audible sound waves frequencies into [[ultrasound]] (above 20 [[Hertz|kHz]]), beyond the range of human hearing. The Russian [[AN-94]] assault rifle has a muzzle attachment that claims apparent noise reduction by venting some gases through a \"dog-whistle\" type channel. Phase cancellation occurs when similar sound waves encounter each other 180\u00b0 out of phase, cancelling the amplitude of the wave and eliminating the pressure variations perceived as sound.\n\nAn alternate method under development is called the anti-phase destructive interference generator.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The process involves duplication of the sound waves generated by the muzzle blast, which are then used to create an anti-phase auditory signal. Currently, this is a muzzle attached device, and is only being tested to cancel out the gunshot sound of the firearm. The devices tested incorporate multiple microphones, speakers and an auditory processor. The first shot fired is recorded, and then played back precisely out of sync(180 degrees out of phase) with each subsequent shot. This has proven successful with small caliber(.17-.22) rifles, but the amplitude has not been matched efficiently with larger cartridges. With the use of subsonic ammunition, the resultant sound waves effectively cancel each other out, and with the exception of the sound of the action cycling, completely eliminate any gunshot sound. In the current development stage, this has worked only in close proximity to the shooter, and the pressure wave(p-wave) can still be felt. Each time a different type of ammunition or firearm is used, the device needs recalibration.\n\nTaking advantage of either property requires that the silencer be designed within the specification of the muzzle blast in mind. For example, the velocity of the sound waves is a major factor. This figure can change significantly between different cartridges and barrel lengths.\n\nHowever, these concepts are controversial because a muzzle blast creates [[white noise|broadband noise]] rather than [[pure tone]]s, and phase cancellation in particular is therefore extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve. Some suppressor manufacturers claim to use phase cancellation in their designs.<ref name=\"WebbDoherty2010\"/>\n\nFrom a physics standpoint, supersonic cartridge loads are impractical to suppress past the levels that are merely hearing-safe for the shooter due to the sonic boom emitted by the bullet, and cartridges such as [[.22 LR]] and [[.45 ACP]] have long been recognized as the easiest to suppress even if using technology dating back to the 1940s.<ref name=\"assassin\"/><ref name=\"Supersonic\"/>\n\n===Captive-piston silencer===\nAnother silencer technology uses a captive piston cartridge; examples are the Smith & Wesson [[Quiet Special Purpose Revolver]] (QSPR) and the Soviet and Russian [[PSS silent pistol]],<ref name=sadj>{{cite web |url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/beyond-quiet-the-russian-pss-captive-piston-pistol/ |title=Beyond Quiet: The Russian PSS Captive Piston Pistol (2 Web pages)|website=Small Arms Defense Journa|date=16 August 2011|author= |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> [[OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver]] and the MTs-116M suppressed sniper rifle, a 12.7mm silenced development of the 7.62mm MTs-116M.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22862616/russia-silent-sniper-rifle/ |title=The Science of Russia's New Silent Sniper Rifle |website=Popular Mechanics|date=25 August 2018 |author=David Hambling |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> The large calibre allows the bullet to be fired at subsonic speed, eliminating a major source of noise, while retaining accuracy, range, and effectiveness. All these weapons use special, very expensive, captive-piston ammunition; the QSPR used ammunition which resembled metal-cased .410-bore shotgun shells. The cartridge case internally works as a piston to trap the gases; the piston pushes the bullet, but the gases are retained in the cartridge case instead of being expelled noisily; in tests of the PSS the sound pressure level was 124.6&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]], similar to a suppressed .22 rimfire pistol.<ref name=sadj/> The ammunition itself, rather than the weapon, is silent; in the US each individual round is considered to be a silencer, subject to regulations on silencers.<ref name=sadj/>\n\n===Improvised silencers===\nImprovised silencers have been made from a variety of materials.

Other sounds emanating from the weapon remain unchanged. Even subsonic bullets make distinct sounds by their passage through the air and striking targets, and supersonic bullets produce a small sonic boom, resulting in a \"ballistic crack\". Semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms also make distinct noises as their actions cycle, ejecting the fired cartridge case and loading a new round.\n\nAside from reductions in volume, suppressors tend to alter the sound to something that is not identifiable as a gunshot.<ref name=\"Dougherty2012\"/> This reduces or eliminates attention drawn to the shooter. A Finnish expression dating from the [[Winter War]] says that \"A silencer does not make a soldier silent, but it does make him invisible.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Guns & Weapons for Law Enforcement|year= 2004|issue=8|title=Finland's Silenced .338 Long-Range Sniper:Sako TRG42 Rifle and BR-Tuote T8M Reflex Suppressor|first= Al |last=Paulson|publisher=Harris Publications|location=New York|volume=1|url=http://www.canadiantactical.ca/PaulsonArticle2.html}}</ref> Silencers are particularly useful in enclosed spaces where the sound, flash and pressure effects of a weapon being fired are amplified. Such effects may disorient the shooter, affecting [[situational awareness]], concentration and accuracy, and can permanently damage hearing very quickly.<ref name=\"Dater2007\"/>\n\nAs the suppressed sound of firing is overshadowed by ballistic crack, observers can be deceived as to the location of the shooter, often from 90 to 180 degrees from his actual location. However, [[counter-sniper tactics]] can include [[gunfire locator]]s, such as the U.S. [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang]] system, where sensitive microphones are coupled to computers running algorithms, and use the ballistic crack to detect and localize the origin of the shot.\n\nThere are many advantages in using a silencer that are not related to the sound.\n\nHunters using [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire rifles]] find silencers bring various important benefits that outweigh the extra weight and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter as well as their companions. Many hunters have suffered permanent hearing damage due to someone else firing a high-caliber gun too closely without warning.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=National Hearing Conservation Association|year= 2017|title=NHCA Position Statement, Recreational Firearm Noise |first=Michael |last=Stewart |first2=Deanna K. |last2=Meinke |first3=Gregory A. |last3=Flamme |first4=William J. |last4=Murphy |first5=Donald S. |last5=Finan |first6=James E. |last6=Lankford |first7=Stephen M. |last7= Tasko |url=https://www.hearingconservation.org/assets/docs/NHCA_position_paper_on_firea.pdf}}</ref> By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer to follow through calmly on their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary. [[Wildlife]] of all kinds are often confused as to the direction of the source of a well-suppressed shot. In the field, however, the comparatively large size of a centerfire rifle suppressor can cause unwanted noise if it bumps or rubs against vegetation or rocks, so many users cover them with [[neoprene]] sleeves.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/>\n\nSilencers reduce firing [[recoil]] significantly, primarily by diverting and trapping the propellant gas. The gas generally has much less mass than the projectile, but it exits the muzzle at multiples of the projectile velocity, so reducing the speed and quantity of the gas expelled can significantly reduce the total [[momentum]] of the matter (gas and projectile) leaving the barrel, the negation of which, because momentum is [[Conservation of momentum|conserved]], is transferred to the gun as recoil. Paulson ''et al.'', discussing low-velocity pistol calibers, suggest the recoil reduction is around 15%.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|38\u201340}} With high-velocity calibers, recoil reduction runs in the range of 20\u201330%.<ref name=\"MarkWhite\"/> The added mass of the suppressor\u2014normally 300 to 500&nbsp;grams\u2014also helps to manage the recoil.\n\nA suppressor also cools the hot gases coming out of the barrel enough that most of the [[lead]]-laced [[vapor]] that leaves the barrel [[condensation|condenses]] inside the silencer, reducing the amount of lead that might be inhaled by the shooter and others around them. However, in auto-loading actions this might be offset by increased [[back pressure]], which results in propellant gas blowing back into a shooter's face through the chamber during case ejection.<ref name=\"Emptormaven\"/>\n\n===Subsonic ammunition===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nIn weapons firing [[supersonic]] ammunition, the bullet itself produces a loud and very sharp sound as it leaves the muzzle in excess of the speed of sound and gradually reducing speed as it travels downrange. This is a small sonic boom, and is referred to in the firearm field as \"ballistic crack\" or \"sonic signature\". Subsonic ammunition eliminates this sound, but at the cost of lower velocity, resulting in decreased range and much decreased [[muzzle energy]] unless the bullet weight is increased, thus lessening effectiveness on the target. For example, if the muzzle velocity is reduced from {{cvt|820|m/s|order=flip}} (common for the [[.308 Winchester]], for example) to a subsonic {{cvt|290|m/s|order=flip}}, the muzzle energy is reduced by a factor of 8. Military marksmen and police units may use subsonic ammunition in suppressed rifles, when minimal noise is more important than range and energy.<ref name=\"sniper\"/>\n\nHowever, the numeric effectiveness of subsonic rounds is, again, misrepresented by media.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> Independent testing of commercially available firearm suppressors with commercially available subsonic rounds has found that .308 subsonic rounds decreased the volume at the muzzle by 10 to 12&nbsp;dB when compared to the same caliber of suppressed supersonic ammunition.<ref name=\"results\" /> When combined with silencers, the subsonic .308 rounds metered between 121 and 137&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe ballistic crack depends on the speed of sound, which in turn depends mainly on air temperature. At sea level, an ambient temperature of {{convert|70|F}}, and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|1140|ft/s}}. Bullets that travel near the speed of sound are considered [[transonic]], which means that the airflow over the surface of the bullet, which at points travels faster than the bullet itself, can break the speed of sound. [[Bullet#Pointed bullets|Pointed bullets]], which gradually displace air, can get closer to the speed of sound than round- or snub-nosed bullets before becoming transonic.\n\nSpecial cartridges have been developed for use with a silencer. These cartridges use very heavy bullets to make up for the energy lost by keeping the bullet subsonic. A good example of this is the [[.300 Whisper]] cartridge, which is formed from a necked-up [[.221 Remington Fireball]] cartridge case. The subsonic .300 Whisper fires up to a {{convert|250|gr}}, .30 caliber bullet at about {{convert|980|ft/s}}, generating about {{convert|533|ftlbf}} of energy at the muzzle. While this is similar to the energy available from the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, the reduced diameter and streamlined shape of the heavy .30 caliber bullet provides far better [[external ballistics|external ballistic]] performance, improving range substantially.\n\n[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Parabellum]], a very popular caliber for suppressed shooting, can use almost any factory-loaded {{convert|147|gr}} weight round to achieve subsonic performance. These 147&nbsp;gr weight bullets typically have a velocity of {{convert|900|-|980|ft/s}}, which is less than the {{convert|1140|ft/s}} speed of sound.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n[[File:AS Val & VSS Vintorez - RaceofHeroes-part2-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Integral silencer on [[VSS Vintorez]] sniper rifle and [[AS Val]] assault rifle]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/Russian [[Armor-piercing shot and shell#Small arms|armor-piercing]] [[9\u00d739mm]] ammunition used in rifles such as the [[AS Val]] has a high subsonic [[ballistic coefficient]], high retained downrange energy, high [[sectional density]], and moderate recoil.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\"/>\n\nWithout using subsonic ammunition, the [[muzzle velocity]] of a supersonic bullet can be lowered by other means, before it leaves the barrel. Some silencer designs, referred to as \"integrals\", do this by allowing gas to bleed off along the length of the barrel before the projectile exits. The [[MP5SD]] is an example of this, with holes right after the chamber of the barrel used to reduce a regular 115 or 124&nbsp;gr ammunition to subsonic velocities.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n==Effectiveness==\n[[File:Silencerco Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and Silencerco Saker 5.56.JPG|thumb|Firearm silencers including the SilencerCo Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and SilencerCo Saker 5.56]]\n\nLive tests by independent reviewers of numerous commercially available suppressors find that even low-power, unsuppressed .22&nbsp;LR handguns produce gunshots over 160&nbsp;[[decibels]].<ref name=\"results\"/> A recent study of various suppressors reported peak sound pressure level reductions between 17 dB and 24 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William J.|last2=Flamme|first2=Gregory A.|last3=Campbell|first3=Adam R.|last4=Zechmann|first4=Edward L.|last5=Tasko|first5=Stephen M.|last6=Lankford|first6=James E.|last7=Meinke|first7=Deanna K.|last8=Finan|first8=Donald S.|last9=Stewart|first9=Michael|date=2018-01-26|title=The reduction of gunshot noise and auditory risk through the use of firearm suppressors and low-velocity ammunition|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=57|issue=sup1|pages=S28\u2013S41|doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1407459|issn=1499-2027|pmid=29299940}}</ref> Another study evaluated two calibers of rifle and nine suppressors, .223 caliber [[AR-15 style rifle|AR-15]] (five suppressors) and .300 caliber AAC Blackout (four suppressors), and reported noise reduction of the peak sound level pressure between 7 dB and 32 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lobarinas|first=Edward|last2=Scott|first2=Ryan|last3=Spankovich|first3=Christopher|last4=Prell|first4=Colleen G.

However, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] uses 140&nbsp;dB as the \"safety cutoff\" for [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]], which has led most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140&nbsp;dB silencers as \"hearing safe\". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to impact noise over 130&nbsp;dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single .308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of silencers to wear additional ear protection.\n\nDecibel testing measures only the peak sound \"pressure\" noise, not duration or frequency. Limitations of dB testing become apparent in a comparison of sound between a [[.308 Winchester|.308 caliber]] rifle and a [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] rifle. The dB meter will show that both rifles produce the same decibel level of noise. Upon firing these rifles, however, it is clear that the .300 Winchester Magnum sounds much louder. What a dB meter does not show is that, although both rifles produce the same peak [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), the .300 Winchester Magnum holds its peak duration longer\u2014meaning that the .300 Winchester Magnum sound remains at full value longer, while the .308 peaks and falls off more quickly. Decibel meters fail in this and other regards when being used as the principal means to determine silencer capability. In a physical sense, dB meters essentially take a short-time average ([[Root mean square|RMS]] intensity of a sonic signal or impulse) over a specified period of time (sampling rate), and do not take into account the rate of increase of the sound wave packet (first derivative of packet envelope), which would in practice provide a better sense of the human [[Sound perception|perception of sound]].<ref name=\"AWC\"/>\n\nAlan C.

The tax payment buys a [[revenue stamp]], which is the legal document allowing possession of a suppressor.

Part of it can be managed; however, some of it is beyond the ability of the operator or manufacturers to eliminate.\n\nIn order of importance, the three ways a firearm generates sound are:\n*Muzzle blast \u2014 [[shockwave]] generated by high-pressure gases escaping and expanding from the muzzle after the [[projectile]] exits the barrel and breaks the functional [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] restraining the gas inside the [[gun barrel#Bore|bore]]\n*[[Sonic boom]] \u2014 sharp [[bullwhip]]-cracking sound associated with high-frequency shockwaves caused by an object (in this case, the [[bullet]]) flying [[supersonic]]ally through the air\n*Mechanical noise generated by the internal moving parts of the [[firearm action]]\n\nA silencer can only affect the noise generated by the muzzle blast.  While using [[subsonic ammunition]]s can negate the sonic boom, mechanical noise can be mitigated but is nearly impossible to eliminate.  For these reasons, it is difficult to completely silence any firearm, or achieve an acceptable{{clarify|date=June 2018}} level of noise suppression in [[revolver]]s that function under standard operating principles due to the looser gas seal between the barrel and the [[cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]].  Some revolvers have technical features that enable suppression and include the Russian [[Nagant M1895]] and [[OTs-38]] revolvers, and the [[S&W QSPR]].\n\n[[Muzzle blast]] generated by firearm discharge is directly proportional to the amount of [[propellant]] to be combusted within the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].  Therefore, the greater the case capacity (e.g. a [[magnum cartridge]]), the louder the muzzle blast and consequently a more efficient or larger silencer system is required.  A gunshot (the combination of the sonic boom, the vacuum release, and hot gases) will almost always be louder than the sound of the action cycling of an [[semi-automatic firearm|autoloading firearm]].  Alan C. Paulson, a renowned firearms specialist, claimed to have encountered an integrally suppressed .22 LR gun that had such a quiet report {{clarify|date=August 2019}} ,<ref name=\"Paulson\"/> although this is somewhat uncommon.  Properly evaluating the sound generated by a firearm can only be done using a [[Decibel Meters|decibel meter]] in conjunction with a [[frequency spectrum]] analyzer during live tests.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:ReflexSuppressor-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a centerfire rifle silencer, showing expansion chamber \"reflexed\" (going back around) the rifle barrel, and four sound baffles.

(The illustration cannot demonstrate this well.)]]\n[[File:Navy-HushPuppy-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a pistol silencer, showing expansion chamber wrapped around inner suppressor assembly, and four wipes. The bullet pushes a bullet-diameter hole through the wipes, trapping propellant gas behind it entirely until the bullet has passed through the wipe completely]]\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|Cross section drawing of an \"integral\" sound suppressor in part designed and built into the suppressed firearm.]]\n\nThe silencer is typically a hollow metal tube manufactured from [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]] and contains expansion chambers. This device, typically cylindrical in shape, attaches to the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a [[pistol]], [[submachine gun]], or [[rifle]]. Some \"can\"-type silencers (so-called as they often resemble a [[beverage can]]) may be detached by the user and attached to a different firearm. Another type is the \"integral\" suppressor, which typically consists of an expansion chamber or chambers surrounding the barrel. The barrel has openings or \"ports\" which bleed off gases into the chambers. This type of silencer is part of the firearm (thus the term \"integral\"), and maintenance of the suppressor requires that the firearm be at least partially disassembled.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Huntertown Kestrel 5.56 disassembled.JPG|thumb|left|Firearm suppressor disassembled to show blast chamber, baffles, and sections of the outer tube]]\n\nBoth types of silencers reduce noise by allowing the rapidly expanding gases from the firing of the cartridge to be decelerated and cooled through a series of hollow chambers. The trapped gas exits the suppressor over a longer period of time and at a greatly reduced speed, producing less noise signature. The chambers are divided by either ''baffles'' or ''wipes''. There are typically at least four and up to perhaps fifteen chambers in a suppressor, depending on the intended use and design details. Often, a single, larger expansion chamber is located at the muzzle end of a can-type silencer, which allows the propellant gas to expand considerably and slow down before it encounters the baffles or wipes. This larger chamber may be \"reflexed\" toward the rear of the barrel to minimize the overall length of the combined firearm and silencer, especially with longer weapons such as rifles.\n\nSilencers vary greatly in size and efficiency. One disposable type developed in the 1980s by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for [[9\u00d719mm]] pistols was {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} in outside diameter, and was designed for six shots with standard ammunition or up to thirty shots with [[speed of sound|subsonic]] (slower than the speed of sound) [[ammunition]]. In contrast, one suppressor designed for rifles firing the powerful [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber (BMG)]] cartridge is {{convert|509|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Barrett\"/>\n\nTwo ancillary advantages to the silencer are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash is reduced by both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of propellant gasses, which can contribute 30\u201350% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the propellant gasses. This can cause them to function somewhat like a [[muzzle booster]] and thus increase the felt recoil. The weight of the silencer and the location of that additional weight at the muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due to the location of this mass.\n\n===Components===\n\n===Baffles and spacers===\nBaffles are usually circular metal dividers which separate the expansion chambers. Each baffle has a hole in its center to permit the passage of the bullet through the silencer and toward the target. The hole is typically at least 1&nbsp;mm larger than the bullet caliber to minimize the risk of the bullet hitting the baffle in what is known as a \"baffle strike\". Baffles are typically made of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, or alloys such as [[Inconel]], and are either [[machining|machined]] out of solid metal or [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] out of sheet metal. A few silencers for low-powered cartridges such as the [[.22 Long Rifle]] have successfully used plastic baffles (certain models by Vaime and others).<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|186\u2013187}}\n\nThere are several unique baffle designs. M, K, Z, monolithic core<ref name=\"Sparrow\"/> and \u03a9 (Omega) are the most prevalent. M-type is the crudest and comprises an inverted [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. K forms slanted obstructions diverging from the sidewalls, creating [[turbulence]] across the [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]line. Z is expensive to machine and includes \"pockets\" of dead airspace along the sidewalls which trap expanded gases and hold them thereby lengthening the time that the gases cool before exiting. Omega-type baffles form a series of spaced cones drawing gas away from the boreline and incorporate a scalloped mouth creating cross-bore turbulence, which is in turn directed to a \"mouse-hole\" opening between the baffle stack and sidewall.\n\nPropellant gas heats and erodes the baffles, causing wear, which is worsened by high rates of fire. Aluminum baffles are seldom used with fully [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]]s, because service life is unacceptably short. Some modern suppressors using steel or high-temperature alloy baffles can endure extended periods of fully automatic fire without damage. The highest-quality rifle suppressors available today have a claimed service life of greater than 30,000 rounds.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|363\u2013364}} Baffles have not been given any specific angles, a specific size, or weight to meet any standards; they are created on a trial and error basis.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nSpacers separate baffles and keep them aligned at a specified distance from each other inside the silencer. Many baffles and spacers are manufactured as a single assembly and several suppressor designs have all the baffles attached together with spacers as a one-piece helical baffle stack. Modern baffles are usually carefully shaped to divert the propellant gases effectively into the chambers. This shaping can be a slanted flat surface, canted at an angle to the bore, or a conical or otherwise curved surface. One popular technique is to have alternating angled surfaces through the stack of baffles.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n===Wipes and packing material===\nWipes are inner dividers intended to touch the bullet as it passes through the silencer, and are typically made of [[rubber]], [[plastic]], or [[foam]]. Each wipe may either have a hole drilled in it before use, a pattern stamped into its surface at the point where the bullet will strike it, or it may simply be punched through by the bullet. Wipes typically last for a small number of firings (perhaps no more than five) before their performance is significantly degraded. While many suppressors used wipes in the [[Vietnam War]] era, most modern suppressors do not use them as anything that touches the projectile has significant accuracy implications. All \"wipes\" deteriorate quickly and require disassembly and spare parts replacement.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/>\n\n\"Wet\" silencers or \"wet cans\" use a small quantity of water, [[oil]], [[petroleum|grease]], or [[gel]] in the expansion chambers to cool the propellant gases and reduce their volume (see [[ideal gas law]]). The coolant lasts only a few shots before it must be replenished, but can greatly increase the effectiveness of the suppressor. Water is most effective, due to its high [[heat of vaporization]], but it can run or evaporate out of the silencer. Grease, while messier and less effective than water, can be left in the suppressor indefinitely without losing effectiveness. Oil is the least effective and least preferable, as it runs while being as messy as grease, and leaves behind a fine mist of [[aerosol]]ized oil after each shot. Water-based gels, such as wire-pulling lubricant gel, are a good compromise; they offer the efficacy of water with less mess, as they do not run or drip. However, they take longer to apply, as they must be cleared from the bore of the suppressor to ensure a clear path for the bullet (grease requires this step as well). Generally, only pistol silencers are shot wet, as rifle silencers handle such high pressure and heat that the liquid is gone within 1\u20133 shots. Many manufacturers will not warranty their rifle suppressors for \"wet\" fire, as some feel this may even result in a dangerous over-pressurization of the silencer.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nPacking materials such as metal [[mesh]], [[steel wool]], or [[washer (hardware)|metal washers]] may be used to fill the chambers and further dissipate and cool the gases. These are somewhat more effective than empty chambers, but less effective than wet designs.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|130}} Metal mesh, if properly used, may last for hundreds or thousands of shots of spaced semi-automatic fire; however, steel wool usually degrades within ten shots, with stainless steel wool lasting longer than regular steel wool. Like wipes, packing materials are rarely found in modern silencers.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nWipes, packing materials and purpose-designed wet cans have been generally abandoned in 21st-century suppressor design because they decrease overall accuracy and require excessive cleaning and maintenance.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> The instructions from several manufacturers state that their suppressors need not be cleaned at all.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Which manufacturers? Where is this stated?}} Furthermore, legal changes in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s made it much more difficult for end-users to legally replace internal silencer parts, and the newer designs reflect this reality.<ref name=\"Explosives\"/>\n\n===Attachment===\n[[File:AOW and SBR suppressed.jpg|thumb|Silenced 12 gauge shotgun and 7.62\u00d739&nbsp;mm rifle]]\nApart from integral silencers which are integrated as a part of the firearm's barrel, most suppressors have a \"female\" threaded end, which attaches to \"male\" threads cut into the exterior of the barrel. These types of silencers are mostly used on handguns and rifles chambered in .22LR. More powerful rifles may use this type of attachment, but harsh recoil may cause the suppressor to over-tighten to the barrel and the suppressor can become difficult to remove.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> [[SilencerCo]]'s Salvo silencer for shotguns attaches via internal barrel threading normally used to mount removable [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]].<ref>Waldron, Len. \"SilencerCo Salvo 12 Gauge Suppressor Review.\" ''Guns &''\n Ammo''.

In these designs, effects known as [[frequency shifting]] and [[interference (wave propagation)|phase cancellation]] (or destructive interference) are used in an attempt to make the suppressor quieter. These effects are achieved by separating the flow of gases and causing them to collide with each other or by venting them through precision-made holes. The intended effect of frequency shifting is to shift audible sound waves frequencies into [[ultrasound]] (above 20 [[Hertz|kHz]]), beyond the range of human hearing. The Russian [[AN-94]] assault rifle has a muzzle attachment that claims apparent noise reduction by venting some gases through a \"dog-whistle\" type channel. Phase cancellation occurs when similar sound waves encounter each other 180\u00b0 out of phase, cancelling the amplitude of the wave and eliminating the pressure variations perceived as sound.\n\nAn alternate method under development is called the anti-phase destructive interference generator.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The process involves duplication of the sound waves generated by the muzzle blast, which are then used to create an anti-phase auditory signal. Currently, this is a muzzle attached device, and is only being tested to cancel out the gunshot sound of the firearm. The devices tested incorporate multiple microphones, speakers and an auditory processor. The first shot fired is recorded, and then played back precisely out of sync(180 degrees out of phase) with each subsequent shot. This has proven successful with small caliber(.17-.22) rifles, but the amplitude has not been matched efficiently with larger cartridges. With the use of subsonic ammunition, the resultant sound waves effectively cancel each other out, and with the exception of the sound of the action cycling, completely eliminate any gunshot sound. In the current development stage, this has worked only in close proximity to the shooter, and the pressure wave(p-wave) can still be felt. Each time a different type of ammunition or firearm is used, the device needs recalibration.\n\nTaking advantage of either property requires that the silencer be designed within the specification of the muzzle blast in mind. For example, the velocity of the sound waves is a major factor. This figure can change significantly between different cartridges and barrel lengths.\n\nHowever, these concepts are controversial because a muzzle blast creates [[white noise|broadband noise]] rather than [[pure tone]]s, and phase cancellation in particular is therefore extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve. Some suppressor manufacturers claim to use phase cancellation in their designs.<ref name=\"WebbDoherty2010\"/>\n\nFrom a physics standpoint, supersonic cartridge loads are impractical to suppress past the levels that are merely hearing-safe for the shooter due to the sonic boom emitted by the bullet, and cartridges such as [[.22 LR]] and [[.45 ACP]] have long been recognized as the easiest to suppress even if using technology dating back to the 1940s.<ref name=\"assassin\"/><ref name=\"Supersonic\"/>\n\n===Captive-piston silencer===\nAnother silencer technology uses a captive piston cartridge; examples are the Smith & Wesson [[Quiet Special Purpose Revolver]] (QSPR) and the Soviet and Russian [[PSS silent pistol]],<ref name=sadj>{{cite web |url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/beyond-quiet-the-russian-pss-captive-piston-pistol/ |title=Beyond Quiet: The Russian PSS Captive Piston Pistol (2 Web pages)|website=Small Arms Defense Journa|date=16 August 2011|author= |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> [[OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver]] and the MTs-116M suppressed sniper rifle, a 12.7mm silenced development of the 7.62mm MTs-116M.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22862616/russia-silent-sniper-rifle/ |title=The Science of Russia's New Silent Sniper Rifle |website=Popular Mechanics|date=25 August 2018 |author=David Hambling |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> The large calibre allows the bullet to be fired at subsonic speed, eliminating a major source of noise, while retaining accuracy, range, and effectiveness.

The cartridge case internally works as a piston to trap the gases; the piston pushes the bullet, but the gases are retained in the cartridge case instead of being expelled noisily; in tests of the PSS the sound pressure level was 124.6&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]], similar to a suppressed .22 rimfire pistol.<ref name=sadj/> The ammunition itself, rather than the weapon, is silent; in the US each individual round is considered to be a silencer, subject to regulations on silencers.<ref name=sadj/>\n\n===Improvised silencers===\nImprovised silencers have been made from a variety of materials.

Other sounds emanating from the weapon remain unchanged. Even subsonic bullets make distinct sounds by their passage through the air and striking targets, and supersonic bullets produce a small sonic boom, resulting in a \"ballistic crack\". Semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms also make distinct noises as their actions cycle, ejecting the fired cartridge case and loading a new round.\n\nAside from reductions in volume, suppressors tend to alter the sound to something that is not identifiable as a gunshot.<ref name=\"Dougherty2012\"/> This reduces or eliminates attention drawn to the shooter. A Finnish expression dating from the [[Winter War]] says that \"A silencer does not make a soldier silent, but it does make him invisible.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Guns & Weapons for Law Enforcement|year= 2004|issue=8|title=Finland's Silenced .338 Long-Range Sniper:Sako TRG42 Rifle and BR-Tuote T8M Reflex Suppressor|first= Al |last=Paulson|publisher=Harris Publications|location=New York|volume=1|url=http://www.canadiantactical.ca/PaulsonArticle2.html}}</ref> Silencers are particularly useful in enclosed spaces where the sound, flash and pressure effects of a weapon being fired are amplified. Such effects may disorient the shooter, affecting [[situational awareness]], concentration and accuracy, and can permanently damage hearing very quickly.<ref name=\"Dater2007\"/>\n\nAs the suppressed sound of firing is overshadowed by ballistic crack, observers can be deceived as to the location of the shooter, often from 90 to 180 degrees from his actual location. However, [[counter-sniper tactics]] can include [[gunfire locator]]s, such as the U.S. [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang]] system, where sensitive microphones are coupled to computers running algorithms, and use the ballistic crack to detect and localize the origin of the shot.\n\nThere are many advantages in using a silencer that are not related to the sound.\n\nHunters using [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire rifles]] find silencers bring various important benefits that outweigh the extra weight and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter as well as their companions. Many hunters have suffered permanent hearing damage due to someone else firing a high-caliber gun too closely without warning.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=National Hearing Conservation Association|year= 2017|title=NHCA Position Statement, Recreational Firearm Noise |first=Michael |last=Stewart |first2=Deanna K. |last2=Meinke |first3=Gregory A. |last3=Flamme |first4=William J. |last4=Murphy |first5=Donald S. |last5=Finan |first6=James E. |last6=Lankford |first7=Stephen M. |last7= Tasko |url=https://www.hearingconservation.org/assets/docs/NHCA_position_paper_on_firea.pdf}}</ref> By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer to follow through calmly on their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary.

The gas generally has much less mass than the projectile, but it exits the muzzle at multiples of the projectile velocity, so reducing the speed and quantity of the gas expelled can significantly reduce the total [[momentum]] of the matter (gas and projectile) leaving the barrel, the negation of which, because momentum is [[Conservation of momentum|conserved]], is transferred to the gun as recoil. Paulson ''et al.'', discussing low-velocity pistol calibers, suggest the recoil reduction is around 15%.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|38\u201340}} With high-velocity calibers, recoil reduction runs in the range of 20\u201330%.<ref name=\"MarkWhite\"/> The added mass of the suppressor\u2014normally 300 to 500&nbsp;grams\u2014also helps to manage the recoil.\n\nA suppressor also cools the hot gases coming out of the barrel enough that most of the [[lead]]-laced [[vapor]] that leaves the barrel [[condensation|condenses]] inside the silencer, reducing the amount of lead that might be inhaled by the shooter and others around them. However, in auto-loading actions this might be offset by increased [[back pressure]], which results in propellant gas blowing back into a shooter's face through the chamber during case ejection.<ref name=\"Emptormaven\"/>\n\n===Subsonic ammunition===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nIn weapons firing [[supersonic]] ammunition, the bullet itself produces a loud and very sharp sound as it leaves the muzzle in excess of the speed of sound and gradually reducing speed as it travels downrange. This is a small sonic boom, and is referred to in the firearm field as \"ballistic crack\" or \"sonic signature\". Subsonic ammunition eliminates this sound, but at the cost of lower velocity, resulting in decreased range and much decreased [[muzzle energy]] unless the bullet weight is increased, thus lessening effectiveness on the target. For example, if the muzzle velocity is reduced from {{cvt|820|m/s|order=flip}} (common for the [[.308 Winchester]], for example) to a subsonic {{cvt|290|m/s|order=flip}}, the muzzle energy is reduced by a factor of 8. Military marksmen and police units may use subsonic ammunition in suppressed rifles, when minimal noise is more important than range and energy.<ref name=\"sniper\"/>\n\nHowever, the numeric effectiveness of subsonic rounds is, again, misrepresented by media.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> Independent testing of commercially available firearm suppressors with commercially available subsonic rounds has found that .308 subsonic rounds decreased the volume at the muzzle by 10 to 12&nbsp;dB when compared to the same caliber of suppressed supersonic ammunition.<ref name=\"results\" /> When combined with silencers, the subsonic .308 rounds metered between 121 and 137&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe ballistic crack depends on the speed of sound, which in turn depends mainly on air temperature. At sea level, an ambient temperature of {{convert|70|F}}, and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|1140|ft/s}}. Bullets that travel near the speed of sound are considered [[transonic]], which means that the airflow over the surface of the bullet, which at points travels faster than the bullet itself, can break the speed of sound. [[Bullet#Pointed bullets|Pointed bullets]], which gradually displace air, can get closer to the speed of sound than round- or snub-nosed bullets before becoming transonic.\n\nSpecial cartridges have been developed for use with a silencer. These cartridges use very heavy bullets to make up for the energy lost by keeping the bullet subsonic. A good example of this is the [[.300 Whisper]] cartridge, which is formed from a necked-up [[.221 Remington Fireball]] cartridge case. The subsonic .300 Whisper fires up to a {{convert|250|gr}}, .30 caliber bullet at about {{convert|980|ft/s}}, generating about {{convert|533|ftlbf}} of energy at the muzzle. While this is similar to the energy available from the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, the reduced diameter and streamlined shape of the heavy .30 caliber bullet provides far better [[external ballistics|external ballistic]] performance, improving range substantially.\n\n[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Parabellum]], a very popular caliber for suppressed shooting, can use almost any factory-loaded {{convert|147|gr}} weight round to achieve subsonic performance. These 147&nbsp;gr weight bullets typically have a velocity of {{convert|900|-|980|ft/s}}, which is less than the {{convert|1140|ft/s}} speed of sound.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n[[File:AS Val & VSS Vintorez - RaceofHeroes-part2-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Integral silencer on [[VSS Vintorez]] sniper rifle and [[AS Val]] assault rifle]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/Russian [[Armor-piercing shot and shell#Small arms|armor-piercing]] [[9\u00d739mm]] ammunition used in rifles such as the [[AS Val]] has a high subsonic [[ballistic coefficient]], high retained downrange energy, high [[sectional density]], and moderate recoil.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\"/>\n\nWithout using subsonic ammunition, the [[muzzle velocity]] of a supersonic bullet can be lowered by other means, before it leaves the barrel. Some silencer designs, referred to as \"integrals\", do this by allowing gas to bleed off along the length of the barrel before the projectile exits. The [[MP5SD]] is an example of this, with holes right after the chamber of the barrel used to reduce a regular 115 or 124&nbsp;gr ammunition to subsonic velocities.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n==Effectiveness==\n[[File:Silencerco Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and Silencerco Saker 5.56.JPG|thumb|Firearm silencers including the SilencerCo Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and SilencerCo Saker 5.56]]\n\nLive tests by independent reviewers of numerous commercially available suppressors find that even low-power, unsuppressed .22&nbsp;LR handguns produce gunshots over 160&nbsp;[[decibels]].<ref name=\"results\"/> A recent study of various suppressors reported peak sound pressure level reductions between 17 dB and 24 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William J.|last2=Flamme|first2=Gregory A.|last3=Campbell|first3=Adam R.|last4=Zechmann|first4=Edward L.|last5=Tasko|first5=Stephen M.|last6=Lankford|first6=James E.|last7=Meinke|first7=Deanna K.|last8=Finan|first8=Donald S.|last9=Stewart|first9=Michael|date=2018-01-26|title=The reduction of gunshot noise and auditory risk through the use of firearm suppressors and low-velocity ammunition|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=57|issue=sup1|pages=S28\u2013S41|doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1407459|issn=1499-2027|pmid=29299940}}</ref> Another study evaluated two calibers of rifle and nine suppressors, .223 caliber [[AR-15 style rifle|AR-15]] (five suppressors) and .300 caliber AAC Blackout (four suppressors), and reported noise reduction of the peak sound level pressure between 7 dB and 32 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lobarinas|first=Edward|last2=Scott|first2=Ryan|last3=Spankovich|first3=Christopher|last4=Prell|first4=Colleen G.

However, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] uses 140&nbsp;dB as the \"safety cutoff\" for [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]], which has led most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140&nbsp;dB silencers as \"hearing safe\". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to impact noise over 130&nbsp;dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single .308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of silencers to wear additional ear protection.\n\nDecibel testing measures only the peak sound \"pressure\" noise, not duration or frequency. Limitations of dB testing become apparent in a comparison of sound between a [[.308 Winchester|.308 caliber]] rifle and a [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] rifle. The dB meter will show that both rifles produce the same decibel level of noise. Upon firing these rifles, however, it is clear that the .300 Winchester Magnum sounds much louder. What a dB meter does not show is that, although both rifles produce the same peak [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), the .300 Winchester Magnum holds its peak duration longer\u2014meaning that the .300 Winchester Magnum sound remains at full value longer, while the .308 peaks and falls off more quickly. Decibel meters fail in this and other regards when being used as the principal means to determine silencer capability. In a physical sense, dB meters essentially take a short-time average ([[Root mean square|RMS]] intensity of a sonic signal or impulse) over a specified period of time (sampling rate), and do not take into account the rate of increase of the sound wave packet (first derivative of packet envelope), which would in practice provide a better sense of the human [[Sound perception|perception of sound]].<ref name=\"AWC\"/>\n\nAlan C.

The Society had been commissioned to map the area as a third party unbiased by local [[Nationalism|national interests]]. He arrived in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], in June. While on the expedition in 1907, Fawcett claimed to have seen and shot a {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=mid}} long giant anaconda, a claim for which he was ridiculed by scientists. He reported other mysterious animals unknown to zoology, such as a small cat-like dog about the size of a [[foxhound]], which he claimed to have seen twice, and the giant Apazauca spider which was said to have poisoned a number of locals.<ref>Fawcett, P.

He was mostly amicable with the locals through gifts, patience, and courteous behaviour. In 1908, he traced the source of the [[Verde River (Guapor\u00e9 River)|Rio Verde]] (Brazil) and in 1910 made a journey to [[Heath River]] (on the border between [[Peru]] and Bolivia) to find its source, having retired from the British army on 19 January.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=18 January 1910 |issue=28330 |page=434 |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nAfter a 1913 expedition, he supposedly claimed to have seen dogs with double noses.

He theorized that a complex civilization once existed in the Amazon region and that isolated ruins may have survived.<ref name=\"Yorker\">{{cite journal |last=Grann |first=David |title=The Lost City of Z |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 September 2005 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/the-lost-city-of-z |accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> Fawcett also found a document known as \"Manuscript 512\", written after explorations made in the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'' of the state of [[Bahia]], and housed at the National Library of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It is believed to be by Portuguese [[bandeirante]] {{ill|Jo\u00e3o da Silva Guimar\u00e3es|pt}}, who wrote that in 1753 he'd discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with [[hieroglyphics]]; the city is described in great detail without providing a specific location. This city became a secondary destination for Fawcett, after \"Z\". (See Fawcett's own book ''Exploration Fawcett''.)\n\nAt the beginning of the [[First World War]] Fawcett returned to Britain to serve with the Army as a Reserve Officer in the Royal Artillery, volunteering for duty in [[Flanders]], and commanding an [[artillery brigade]] despite being nearly 50 years old. He was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel on 1 March 1918,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=10 January 1919 |supp=y |issue=31120 |page=674 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and received three [[mentions in despatches]] from [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], in November 1916,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=2 January 1917 |supp=y |issue=29890 |page=208 |nolink=yes}}</ref> November 1917,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=7 December 1917 |supp=y |issue=30421 |page=12912 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and November 1918,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=17 December 1918 |supp=y |issue=31077 |page=14926 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and was also awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in June 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=1 June 1917 |supp=y |issue=30111 |pages=5468\u20135470  |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Fawcett returned to Brazil to study local wildlife and [[archaeology]]. In 1920, he made a solo attempt to search for \"Z\", but ended it after suffering from a fever and shooting his pack animal.<ref name=\"Yorker\"/>\n\n===Final expedition===\nIn 1925, with funding from a London-based group of financiers known as 'the Glove',<ref>''The London Illustrated News'', 22 June 1924</ref> Fawcett returned to Brazil with his eldest son Jack and Jack's best and longtime friend, Raleigh Rimell, for an exploratory expedition to find \"Z\". Fawcett left instructions stating that if the expedition did not return, no rescue expedition should be sent lest the rescuers suffer his fate.\n\nFawcett was a man with years of experience travelling, and had taken equipment such as canned foods, powdered milk, guns, flares, a [[sextant]], and a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]. His travel companions were both chosen for their health, ability, and loyalty to each other; Fawcett chose only two companions in order to travel lighter and with less notice to native tribes, as some were hostile towards outsiders.\n\nOn 20 April 1925, his final expedition departed from [[Cuiab\u00e1]]. In addition to his two principal companions, Fawcett was accompanied by two Brazilian labourers, two horses, eight mules, and a pair of dogs. The last communication from the expedition was on 29 May 1925 when Fawcett wrote, in a letter to his wife delivered by a native runner, that he was ready to go into unexplored territory with only Jack and Raleigh. They were reported to be crossing the [[Xingu River|Upper Xingu]], a [[Ordinal directions|southeastern]] [[tributary]] river of the [[Amazon River|River Amazon]]. The final letter, written from [[Dead Horse Camp]], gave their location and was generally optimistic.\n\nMany people assumed that local [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indians]] killed them, as several tribes were nearby at the time: the [[Kalapalo]]s, the last tribe to have seen them, the Arum\u00e1s, the [[Suy\u00e1]]s, and the [[Xavante people|Xavantes]] whose territory they were entering. According to explorer [[John Hemming (explorer)|John Hemming]], Fawcett's party of three was too few to survive in the jungle, and his expectation that his Indian hosts would look after them was likely to have antagonized them by failing to bring any gifts to repay their generosity.<ref name=Hemming2017-04-01b>{{cite magazine |author=John Hemming|authorlink=John Hemming (explorer)|title=The Lost City of Z is a very long way from a true story \u2014 and I should know|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/the-lost-city-of-z-is-a-very-long-way-from-a-true-story-and-i-should-know/|date=1 April 2017|accessdate=11 March 2019|magazine= [[The Spectator]]|quote=Everyone in Amazonia knew that you could not cut trails and keep your team fed with fewer than eight men. ...

Allegedly, Fawcett and his companions had a mishap on the river and lost most of the gifts they'd brought along for the Indian tribes. Continuing without gifts was a serious breach of protocol; since the expedition members were all more or less seriously ill at the time, the Kalapalo tribe they encountered decided to kill them. The bodies of Jack Fawcett and Raleigh Rimell were thrown into the river; Colonel Fawcett, considered an old man and therefore distinguished, received a proper burial. Falk-R\u00f8nne visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported that one of the tribesmen confirmed Villas-B\u00f4as's story about how and why Fawcett had been killed.\n\n===Fawcett's bones===\nIn 1951, Orlando Villas-B\u00f4as, activist for indigenous peoples, supposedly received the actual remaining skeletal bones of Fawcett and had them analysed scientifically. The analysis allegedly confirmed the bones were Fawcett's, but his son Brian Fawcett (1906\u20131984) refused to accept this. Villas-B\u00f4as claimed that Brian was too interested in making money from books about his father's disappearance.

He was mostly amicable with the locals through gifts, patience, and courteous behaviour. In 1908, he traced the source of the [[Verde River (Guapor\u00e9 River)|Rio Verde]] (Brazil) and in 1910 made a journey to [[Heath River]] (on the border between [[Peru]] and Bolivia) to find its source, having retired from the British army on 19 January.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=18 January 1910 |issue=28330 |page=434 |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nAfter a 1913 expedition, he supposedly claimed to have seen dogs with double noses.

He theorized that a complex civilization once existed in the Amazon region and that isolated ruins may have survived.<ref name=\"Yorker\">{{cite journal |last=Grann |first=David |title=The Lost City of Z |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 September 2005 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/the-lost-city-of-z |accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> Fawcett also found a document known as \"Manuscript 512\", written after explorations made in the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'' of the state of [[Bahia]], and housed at the National Library of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It is believed to be by Portuguese [[bandeirante]] {{ill|Jo\u00e3o da Silva Guimar\u00e3es|pt}}, who wrote that in 1753 he'd discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with [[hieroglyphics]]; the city is described in great detail without providing a specific location. This city became a secondary destination for Fawcett, after \"Z\". (See Fawcett's own book ''Exploration Fawcett''.)\n\nAt the beginning of the [[First World War]] Fawcett returned to Britain to serve with the Army as a Reserve Officer in the Royal Artillery, volunteering for duty in [[Flanders]], and commanding an [[artillery brigade]] despite being nearly 50 years old. He was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel on 1 March 1918,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=10 January 1919 |supp=y |issue=31120 |page=674 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and received three [[mentions in despatches]] from [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], in November 1916,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=2 January 1917 |supp=y |issue=29890 |page=208 |nolink=yes}}</ref> November 1917,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=7 December 1917 |supp=y |issue=30421 |page=12912 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and November 1918,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=17 December 1918 |supp=y |issue=31077 |page=14926 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and was also awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in June 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=1 June 1917 |supp=y |issue=30111 |pages=5468\u20135470  |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Fawcett returned to Brazil to study local wildlife and [[archaeology]]. In 1920, he made a solo attempt to search for \"Z\", but ended it after suffering from a fever and shooting his pack animal.<ref name=\"Yorker\"/>\n\n===Final expedition===\nIn 1925, with funding from a London-based group of financiers known as 'the Glove',<ref>''The London Illustrated News'', 22 June 1924</ref> Fawcett returned to Brazil with his eldest son Jack and Jack's best and longtime friend, Raleigh Rimell, for an exploratory expedition to find \"Z\". Fawcett left instructions stating that if the expedition did not return, no rescue expedition should be sent lest the rescuers suffer his fate.\n\nFawcett was a man with years of experience travelling, and had taken equipment such as canned foods, powdered milk, guns, flares, a [[sextant]], and a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]. His travel companions were both chosen for their health, ability, and loyalty to each other; Fawcett chose only two companions in order to travel lighter and with less notice to native tribes, as some were hostile towards outsiders.\n\nOn 20 April 1925, his final expedition departed from [[Cuiab\u00e1]]. In addition to his two principal companions, Fawcett was accompanied by two Brazilian labourers, two horses, eight mules, and a pair of dogs. The last communication from the expedition was on 29 May 1925 when Fawcett wrote, in a letter to his wife delivered by a native runner, that he was ready to go into unexplored territory with only Jack and Raleigh.

Allegedly, Fawcett and his companions had a mishap on the river and lost most of the gifts they'd brought along for the Indian tribes. Continuing without gifts was a serious breach of protocol; since the expedition members were all more or less seriously ill at the time, the Kalapalo tribe they encountered decided to kill them. The bodies of Jack Fawcett and Raleigh Rimell were thrown into the river; Colonel Fawcett, considered an old man and therefore distinguished, received a proper burial. Falk-R\u00f8nne visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported that one of the tribesmen confirmed Villas-B\u00f4as's story about how and why Fawcett had been killed.\n\n===Fawcett's bones===\nIn 1951, Orlando Villas-B\u00f4as, activist for indigenous peoples, supposedly received the actual remaining skeletal bones of Fawcett and had them analysed scientifically. The analysis allegedly confirmed the bones were Fawcett's, but his son Brian Fawcett (1906\u20131984) refused to accept this. Villas-B\u00f4as claimed that Brian was too interested in making money from books about his father's disappearance. Later scientific analysis confirmed that the bones were not Fawcett's.<ref>''The upper jaw provides the clearest possible evidence that these human remains were not those of Colonel Fawcett, whose spare upper denture is fortunately available for comparison.

The film is a dramatization of the lives of the people of [[Colorado City, Arizona]], and [[Hildale, Utah]], United States, collectively known as \"Short Creek,\" a community of members of the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], a group that practices [[child marriage]] and [[polygamy]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1953 Arizona, teenagers Jessica Rae \"Jessie\" Jacobs (Diane Lane) and her friend Naomi (Helen Hunt) have grown up in Short Creek as members of an isolated patriarchal polygamist religious community, led by President Frank King (Conrad Bain). The members of the small group dress in old-fashioned clothing and spend many hours a day doing domestic and agricultural chores with traditional equipment and few modern conveniences. The women are trained to serve and be subservient to their husbands. They rarely travel away from the community and are usually kept away from outside influences such as magazines and radio. Jessie's father Jay Jacobs has three wives, including Jessie's mother Mary, who only sees her husband on certain days when he is not with his other wives, and has mixed feelings about the arrangement. State authorities are also investigating the group due to its unlawful customs of polygamy and [[child marriage]] of young girls to older men.\n\nPresident King's 19-year-old son Isaac (Christopher Atkins) returns home safely from serving in the [[Korean War]], having gained knowledge of the outside world through his travels. At his homecoming party, he and Jessie become attracted to each other, and over time they fall in love. To his father's chagrin, Isaac begins to reject the group's lifestyle, including the polygamy which allows the older men of the group to regularly take new young women as wives. Isaac further questions the group's beliefs when his younger sisters accidentally drown because they were not allowed to learn how to swim. Meanwhile, President King has confided to the men of the group that God has told him to take Jessie as his wife, in addition to the three wives he already has. Despite Jessie's youth, her father Jay accepts this as God's will. \n\nJessie's friend Naomi attempts to run away from Short Creek, planning to go to Las Vegas and become an actress. She naively accepts a ride from two young men who get her to drink alcohol for the first time and then try to rape her. She is rescued just in time by President King and driven back to Short Creek, where she is immediately married off to an old man to settle her down. \n\nIsaac learns that his father is planning to marry Jessie and is furious, not only because of his own feelings for Jessie but because an additional wife will cause his mother to be further neglected by his father. President King also tells Jessie of his plan to marry her. A reluctant Jessie goes along with his plan because she wants to please her parents and do the will of God, but she is very unhappy.\n\nJessie and Isaac secretly confess their love for each other and plan to run away together. However, after going a short distance they see many armed police preparing to launch a raid on the group. Fearing for the lives of her mother and family, Jessie decides she must go back to warn them, and says an emotional goodbye to Isaac, who boards a bus alone as Jessie rushes back to warn the community just ahead of the police. The police arrive and separate the families, sending the women and children to barracks where they will be re-educated in a modern lifestyle, while the men are sent to jail. \n\nTwo years later, Jessie and her mother Mary, along with the other community women, are being transferred once again from one barracks to another and are in line to board the bus when Jessie sees Isaac, who has just arrived in a car. Mary, seeing that Isaac and Jessie still love each other, tells her daughter to \"run, while you still have a chance\". Jessie hugs Mary goodbye, and goes to join Isaac; they drive away together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Atkins]]: Isaac King\n* [[Diane Lane]]: Jessica Jacobs\n* [[Conrad Bain]] : Frank King \n* [[Helen Hunt]]: Naomi\n* [[Kiel Martin]] : Bob Kalish \n* [[Dee Wallace]]: Mary Jacobs\n* Julianne Slocum: Jacobs Daughter\n* Jake Johnston: Garth Jacobs\n*Karyn Christensen: Ada King\n*Sharyn Christensen: Alma King\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were shot in [[Grafton, Utah|Grafton]], Rockville Road, and [[Rockville Bridge (Rockville, Utah)|Rockville Bridge]] in [[Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0082169}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Child Bride Of Short Creek}}\n[[Category:1981 television films]]\n[[Category:1980s drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:NBC network original films]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=November 2009}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Child Bride of Short Creek\n| image                = Childbrideofshortcreek2.jpg\n| image_size           = 220\n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = DVD cover\n| genre                = \n| creator              = \n| based_on             = \n| writer               = [[Joyce Eliason]]<br />\n| screenplay           = \n| story                = [[Michael Fessier Jr.]]\n| director             = [[Robert Michael Lewis]]\n| starring             = [[Christopher Atkins]]<br />[[Diane Lane]]<br />[[Conrad Bain]]<br />[[Helen Hunt]]\n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = [[John Cacavas]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_episodes         = \n| producer             = [[Paul Monash]]<br />[[Lawrence Schiller]]\n| editor               = [[John J.

He earned 8 caps for the [[Italy national football team]] and took part in the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship]]. He was known as an intelligent, hardworking, tactically versatile, and correct player throughout his career, with good technique and determination, and could also play as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], a role in which he was frequently deployed in his later career, following his athletic decline, due to his [[Playmaker|playmaking]] ability.<ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Luca FUSI\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n== Club career ==\nFusi began his career with [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]], then playing for [[U.C.

Napoli|Napoli]], winning a [[UEFA Cup]] in 1989 and a [[Serie A]] championship type in 1990. In June 1990 he successively left Napoli to become part of the [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] midfield. Ironically for him, he scored his only Serie A goal for Torino away to Napoli on 16 February 1992, a left-footed strike from outside the area. Having won another [[Coppa Italia]] title in [[1992\u201393 Coppa Italia|1993]], also reaching the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1992 UEFA Cup final]], he moved to crosstown rivals [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], where he won another [[Serie A]] title and a personal third [[Coppa Italia]] in 1995, although he began to be deployed less frequently when Lippi switched to a zonal marking defensive system, which did not feature a sweeper, and collected only 10 appearances in the league in total, and 18 in all competitions throughout the season. He ended his career with [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side [[AC Lugano]], where he played from 1996 to 1997.<ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Luca FUSI\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n== International career ==\nFusi made his Italian national team debut on 31 March 1988 in [[Split (city)|Split]], against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], as a substitute for [[Luigi De Agostini]]. He was also called up for Italy at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] under manager [[Azeglio Vicini]], but did not play in any of Italy's games during the tournament as the team reached the semi-finals.

He earned 8 caps for the [[Italy national football team]] and took part in the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship]]. He was known as an intelligent, hardworking, tactically versatile, and correct player throughout his career, with good technique and determination, and could also play as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], a role in which he was frequently deployed in his later career, following his athletic decline, due to his [[Playmaker|playmaking]] ability.<ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Luca FUSI\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n== Club career ==\nFusi began his career with [[Como Calcio 1907|Como]], then playing for [[U.C.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nThe Huber site is the type site for an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture known for its distinctive shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery.  Although the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations, a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] site in northwestern Indiana, just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013222 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], plain surface pots with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised or trailed lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed-over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, usually in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted.  The most common are everted with square lip; everted with the lip thickened on either the inside or outside; and everted with pointed lip.  Almost half of the lips are unnotched.  Of the body sherds showing incised lines, there were more fine-line incised lines than either medium- or wide-line.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 82%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 9%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 1%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - less than 1% of the pottery was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly cordmarked surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n* Other types - 2.5%\n\n== Chronology of Huber pottery within the Huber sequence ==\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age.  Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have cordmarked surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nTemporal trends may be seen by a comparison to the nearby [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm site]].  The pottery from the Huber site assemblage overwhelmingly has smooth surface with only 1% of sherds cordmarked; in contrast, Hoxie Farm's pottery was 23.5% cordmarked.  45% of incised decoration was fine-line incised, compared to 13% at Hoxie Farm.  Also, almost 50% of lips are unnotched, compared to only 20% at Hoxie Farm.  This indicates the Huber Site assemblage dates to a later time period than Hoxie Farm.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nThe Huber site is the type site for an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture known for its distinctive shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery.  Although the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations, a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] site in northwestern Indiana, just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013222 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], plain surface pots with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised or trailed lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed-over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, usually in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted.  The most common are everted with square lip; everted with the lip thickened on either the inside or outside; and everted with pointed lip.  Almost half of the lips are unnotched.  Of the body sherds showing incised lines, there were more fine-line incised lines than either medium- or wide-line.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 82%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 9%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 1%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - less than 1% of the pottery was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly cordmarked surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n* Other types - 2.5%\n\n== Chronology of Huber pottery within the Huber sequence ==\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age.  Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have cordmarked surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nTemporal trends may be seen by a comparison to the nearby [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm site]].  The pottery from the Huber site assemblage overwhelmingly has smooth surface with only 1% of sherds cordmarked; in contrast, Hoxie Farm's pottery was 23.5% cordmarked.  45% of incised decoration was fine-line incised, compared to 13% at Hoxie Farm.  Also, almost 50% of lips are unnotched, compared to only 20% at Hoxie Farm.  This indicates the Huber Site assemblage dates to a later time period than Hoxie Farm.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are Upper Mississippian cultures which existed in the southern Lake Michigan region in the states of northern Illinois and Indiana and southwest Michigan.
