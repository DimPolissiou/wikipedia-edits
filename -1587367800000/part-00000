On October 20, 1976, one of these ferries, the [[MV George Prince ferry disaster|''George Prince'']], was struck by a tanker and capsized as it crossed the [[Mississippi River]] resulting in the MV ''George Prince'' ferry disaster.

Many observers believe his conviction and trial were unfair and flawed. He was convicted and sentenced to prison.

The population was 11,535 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], an increase of 275 over the 2000 tabulation of 11,260.\n\nThe community is named after [[Jean Noel Destr\u00e9han|Jean No\u00ebl Destr\u00e9han]] (1754\u20131823), who was twice President of the [[Orleans Territory]]'s legislative council during his service there in 1806 and 1811. He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] when [[Louisiana]] became a [[U.S. state|state]] in 1812, but he resigned after a month. He served in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] from 1812 to 1817.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lahistory.org/site21.php |title=Dictionary of La.

On October 20, 1976, one of these ferries, the [[MV George Prince ferry disaster|''George Prince'']], was struck by a tanker and capsized as it crossed the [[Mississippi River]] resulting in the MV George Prince ferry disaster. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died.\n\n=== Gary Tyler case ===\nDestrehan was briefly notorious in 1974 for the case of [[Gary Tyler]], a 17 year old black student who was accused by local officials of the murder of 13 year old white student and the wounding of another, on a day of violent  protests by white students at Destrehan High School. Many observers believe his conviction and trial were unfair and flawed. He was convicted and sentenced to prison. He was released from prison in 2016.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/05/opinion/05herbert.html?_r=1 Bob Herbert, \"Gary Tyler\u2019s Lost Decades\"], ''New York Times,'' 5 February 2007</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nDestrehan is located at {{Coord|29|57|44|N|90|22|9|W|type:city}} (29.962307, -90.369160).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|7.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.9|sqmi|km2}} are land and {{convert|1.0|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} (12.41%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 11,260 people, 3,629 households, and 3,073 families residing in the CDP.

Following a two-year testing period, Steam Machines and its related hardware were released on November 10, 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Anchor|Piston|Steam Box}}\n\nSteam, a large digital store-front for video games supporting many third-party developers and publishers, was developed by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] primarily for [[Microsoft Windows]] and accounts for an estimated 75% of digitally purchased games on that platform.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html | title = Valve Lines Up Console Partners in Challenge to Microsoft, Sony | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | first = Cliff | last = Edwards | date = November 4, 2013 | accessdate = November 5, 2013 }}</ref> Valve has indicated displeasure with the approaches that both Microsoft and Apple are taking with their respective operating systems, limiting what applications could be run, and upon the release of [[Windows 8]] in 2012, Valve's CEO [[Gabe Newell]] called it \"a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\", and discussed the possibility of promoting the open-source operating system [[Linux]] that would maintain \"the openness of the platform\".<ref name=\"cvg newell linux\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/359898/newell-windows-8-is-a-catastrophe-for-everyone-in-the-pc-space/ | title = Newell: 'Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space' | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = July 25, 2012 | accessdate = January 6, 2013 | first = Mike | last = Jackson }}</ref> Newell recognized that games would need to be a significant part of the push for Linux.<ref name=\"cvg newell linux\"/> An official Linux client for Steam was released in July 2012, along with developer tools to help port games to the platform.<ref name=\"linux announcement\">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/ | title = Steam'd Penguins | publisher = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] | date = July 16, 2012 | accessdate = July 24, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/16/3163717/left-4-dead-2-to-be-first-valve-game-on-linux | title = 'Left 4 Dead 2' to be first Valve game on Linux | first = Tracey | last = Lein | date = July 16, 2012 | accessdate=  July 16, 2012 | publisher = [[The Verve]] }}</ref> Valve has since worked to assure that users' game libraries would be portable, including offering Steam Play whereby purchase of a title for one platform automatically allows that user to play the title on other supported platforms, and cross-platform multiplayer features.\n\nPrior to Valve's official announcement of Steam Machines, rumors of Valve's plan to get into the hardware market had developed in the industry throughout 2012, based on aspects such as the emphasis on the Linux operating system and the introduction of features like the [[10-foot user interface]] \"Big Picture Mode\" for Steam which would be a necessary feature for a video game console.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5941793/valve-is-bringing-steam-to-your-tv-today-watch-out-consoles | title = Valve Is Bringing Steam To Your TV Today.

SteamOS itself was not seen as ready for everyday and gaming use in its initial builds and Valve has been unresponsive at times towards Steam Machine makers to release updates, while concurrently, [[Microsoft]] had announced its free rollout of [[Windows 10]], making that an incentive over Valve's software. Valve also had delayed the Steam Controller release to 2015, which also subsequently delayed the Steam Machine release. Further, the Steam Machine makers felt that the [[Steam Link]], produced by Valve, competed with concept of Steam Machines and was a much more cost-attractive product. In most cases the Steam Machine vendors simply found that there was not as great a market for the product, since it was trying to bridge consoles and home computers, while they found most consumers would flock to one extreme or the other.<ref name=\"pcgamer 2017\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-steam-machines/ | title = What happened to Steam Machines? | first = Tyler | last =Wilde |date = July 7, 2017 |accessdate= July 11, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|store.steampowered.com/livingroom}}\n\n{{Valve}}\n\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2015]]\n[[Category:Steam (service)|Machine]]\n[[Category:X86-based game consoles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox information appliance\n| name = Steam Machine\n| logo = \n| image = Steam Machine from Gigabyte and Steam Controller.jpg\n| caption = Steam Machine from Gigabyte Technology next to an early prototype of the [[Steam Controller]].\n| developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]\n| manufacturer = Various\n| type = {{flatlist|\n* [[Gaming computer|Gaming PC]]\n* [[video game console]]\n}}\n| releasedate = {{start date|2015|11|10}}\n| lifespan = \n| price = {{USD|400}}\u2013$6000\n<small>(Steam Controller $49.99; Steam Link $49.99)</small>\n| discontinued = \n| unitssold = <500,000\n| unitsshipped = \n| media = \n| os = [[SteamOS]]\n| power = \n| processor = \n| storage = \n| RAM = \n| display = \n| graphics = \n| sound = \n| camera = \n| controllers = {{plainlist|\n* [[Steam Controller]] and other gamepads\n* Keyboard and mouse\n}}\n| connectivity = \n| service = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]\n| dimensions = \n| weight = \n| topgame = \n| compatibility = \n| website = {{URL|https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam_machines}}\n}}\n\n'''Steam Machine''' is a line of prebuilt [[gaming computer]]s designed to operate [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[SteamOS]] through the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] client.

SteamOS itself was not seen as ready for everyday and gaming use in its initial builds and Valve has been unresponsive at times towards Steam Machine makers to release updates, while concurrently, [[Microsoft]] had announced its free rollout of [[Windows 10]], making that an incentive over Valve's software. Valve also had delayed the Steam Controller release to 2015, which also subsequently delayed the Steam Machine release. Further, the Steam Machine makers felt that the [[Steam Link]], produced by Valve, competed with concept of Steam Machines and was a much more cost-attractive product. In most cases the Steam Machine vendors simply found that there was not as great a market for the product, since it was trying to bridge consoles and home computers, while they found most consumers would flock to one extreme or the other.<ref name=\"pcgamer 2017\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-steam-machines/ | title = What happened to Steam Machines? | first = Tyler | last =Wilde |date = July 7, 2017 |accessdate= July 11, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|store.steampowered.com/livingroom}}\n\n{{Valve}}\n\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2015]]\n[[Category:Steam (service)|Machine]]\n[[Category:X86-based game consoles]]\n", "name_user": "2601:204:ca00:3bea:e4f8:3ea4:a122:3e0a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePortables:This is pure vaporware.

{"title_page": "Cermand Cestach", "text_new": "'''Cermand Cestach''' was the name of a gold-covered pagan [[Cult image|idol]] which stood in [[Clogher]] Cathedral, [[County Tyrone]], [[Ireland]] until medieval times. Alternative spellings are \"Cermand Celstach\", \"Cermaed Celsetacht\", \"Kermand Kelstach\", \"Kerman Kelstach\" and the Giant Ermand Kelstach.\n\n==Historical references==\n\nThe earliest reference to Cermand Cestach is in the ''Life'' of Saint [[Macartan]] of Clogher (C.430-505&nbsp;A.D.):\n\n{{cquote|\"The Cloch-Oir (Golden Stone), from which this ancient diocese takes its name, was a sacred ceremonial stone to the druids, It was given to St. Macartin by an old pagan noble, who had harassed Macartin in every possible way until the saint's patient love won the local ruler to the faith. The stone is still preserved and the noble's son, [[Tigernach of Clones|Tighernach of Clones]], succeed Macartin as bishop (Benedictines, D'Arcy, Farmer, Healy, Kenney, Montague, Muirhead, Needham).\"}}\n\nThe 6th-century saint Tigernach was patron saint of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]]. His mother was Dervail or Derfraich, daughter of a King of Airgialla (Oriel) and his father was Cairpre Mac Fergusa from [[Leinster]]. The implication is that the idol originally came from [[Leinster]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn a [[Gloss (margin text)|gloss]] on the word \"clochar\" in the August 15th entry of the 8th-century manuscript ''[[F\u00e9lire \u00d3engusso]]'' (Martyrology of Oengus) for the Feastday of the Assumption of Mary, the gloss states\n\n{{cquote|\"there had once been a stone covered in gold which heathens worshipped: And out of it a devil used to speak: Cermand Cestach was his name, and it was the chief idol of the north. That is the short stone on thy right hand as thou enterest the temple of Clochar; and the places of the joints of gold and silver still remain in it.\"}}\n\nThe annalist [[Cathal Maguire]], who died in 1498, stated that this stone-idol was still preserved as a curiosity in the porch of the Cathedral of Clogher in his time.\n\nThe 16th century Register of Clogher records 'A golden stone existing in the city of Clogher from which St.Patrick ejected the demon which gave prophetic responses'.\n\n[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Tuathhall\u00e1in]] (aka [[John Toland]], 1669\u20131722) also wrote:\n\n{{cquote|\"The [[Diocese of Clogher (Roman Catholic)|Bishop's See of Clogher]] has its name from one of these stones, all covered with gold (Clogher signifying the Golden Stone), on which stood Kermand Kelstach, the chief Idol of [[Ulster]]. The stone is still in being. Kermand Kelstach was not the only Mercury of rude stone, since the Mercury of the Greeks was not portray'd antiently in the shape of a youth, with wings to his heels and a caduceus in his hand, but without hands or feet, being a square stone, says Phurnutus, and I say without any sculpture.\"}}\n\n==Later references==\n\n''Lewis's Dictionary'' (1837), entry for Clogher:\n\n{{cquote|\"This place is said to have derived its name from a stone covered with gold, which in pagan times is reported to have made oracular responses. The Clogh-or, or \"golden stone,\" was preserved long after the abolition of paganism; for McGuire, canon of [[Armagh]], who wrote a commentary on the registry of Clogher, in 1490, says \"that this sacred stone is preserved at Clogher, on the right of the entrance into the church, and that traces of the gold with which it had formerly been covered by the workshippers of the idol called Cermaed Celsetacht are still visible.\" There is still a very ancient stone lying on the south side of the cathedral tower, which many believe to be the real Clogh-or. It appears to have some very ancient characters engraved on it, but it evidently nothing more than the shaft of an antique cross of rude workmanship, of which there are several in the ancient cemetery. Clogher is called by [[Ptolemy]] Rhigia or Regia; and according to some authors, [[St. Patrick]] founded and presided over a monastery here, which he resigned to St. Kertenn when he went to Armagh, to establish his famous abbey there; but according to others, it was built at the command of St. Patrick in the street before the royal palace of Ergal, by St. Macartin, who died in 506, and from its vicinity to this palace both the abbey and the town appear anciently\".}}\n\nAn old folk-tale from the [[Isle of Man]] entitled \"\"The Story of the Isle of Falga\", based on the [[Ulster Cycle]] states:- \"''[[Conchobar mac Nessa|Conchobar]], who had not yet become King of Ulster, but was an ambitious young man seeking to gain a kingdom, consulted the famous oracle at Clogher as to how he might best attain his end. The oracle advised him to proceed to the Isle of Man and get Culann to make these weapons for him. Conchobar did so, and prevailed on Culann to begin his task; but, while awaiting its completion, he sauntered one morning along the shore, and in the course of his walk met with a mermaid fast asleep on the beach. He promptly bound the syren, but she, on waking and perceiving what had happened, besought him to liberate her; and to induce him to yield to her petition, she informed him that she was Teeval, the Princess of the Ocean; and promised that if he caused Culann to form her representation on the shield surrounded with this inscription, 'Teeval, Princess\u00b7of the Ocean,' it would possess such extraordinary powers that when ever he was about engaging his enemy in battle, and looked upon her figure on the shield, read the legend, and invoked her name, his enemies would diminish in strength, while he and his people would acquire a proportionate increase in theirs. Conchobar had the shield made according to the advice of Teeval, and, on his return to Ireland, such extraordinary success attended his arms, that he won the kingdom of Ulster. Culann accepted Conchobar's offer, referred to above, and settled on the plain of Murthemne, which was fabled to have been formerly situated beneath the sea. It was here that he was visited by Conchobar, accompanied by his Court and [[Cuchulainn]]''.\"\n\nIn a book entitled \"Omagh: Paintings and Stories from the Seat of the Chiefs\" by Dr Haldane Mitchell, there is a local Tyrone folk-tale about a giant called \"Ermand Kelstach\" and Muckabaw who fought for the hand of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]'s daughter Granua.

His mother was Dervail or Derfraich, daughter of a King of Airgialla (Oriel) and his father was Cairpre Mac Fergusa from [[Leinster]]. The implication is that the idol originally came from [[Leinster]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn a [[Gloss (margin text)|gloss]] on the word \"clochar\" in the August 15th entry of the 8th-century manuscript ''[[F\u00e9lire \u00d3engusso]]'' (Martyrology of Oengus) for the Feastday of the Assumption of Mary, the gloss states\n\n{{cquote|\"there had once been a stone covered in gold which heathens worshipped: And out of it a devil used to speak: Cermand Cestach was his name, and it was the chief idol of the north. That is the short stone on thy right hand as thou enterest the temple of Clochar; and the places of the joints of gold and silver still remain in it.\"}}\n\nThe annalist [[Cathal Maguire]], who died in 1498, stated that this stone-idol was still preserved as a curiosity in the porch of the Cathedral of Clogher in his time.\n\nThe 16th century Register of Clogher records 'A golden stone existing in the city of Clogher from which St.Patrick ejected the demon which gave prophetic responses'.\n\n[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Tuathhall\u00e1in]] (aka [[John Toland]], 1669\u20131722) also wrote:\n\n{{cquote|\"The [[Diocese of Clogher (Roman Catholic)|Bishop's See of Clogher]] has its name from one of these stones, all covered with gold (Clogher signifying the Golden Stone), on which stood Kermand Kelstach, the chief Idol of [[Ulster]].

Kermand Kelstach was not the only Mercury of rude stone, since the Mercury of the Greeks was not portray'd antiently in the shape of a youth, with wings to his heels and a caduceus in his hand, but without hands or feet, being a square stone, says Phurnutus, and I say without any sculpture.\"}}\n\n==Later references==\n\n''Lewis's Dictionary'' (1837), entry for Clogher:\n\n{{cquote|\"This place is said to have derived its name from a stone covered with gold, which in pagan times is reported to have made oracular responses. The Clogh-or, or \"golden stone,\" was preserved long after the abolition of paganism; for McGuire, canon of [[Armagh]], who wrote a commentary on the registry of Clogher, in 1490, says \"that this sacred stone is preserved at Clogher, on the right of the entrance into the church, and that traces of the gold with which it had formerly been covered by the workshippers of the idol called Cermaed Celsetacht are still visible.\" There is still a very ancient stone lying on the south side of the cathedral tower, which many believe to be the real Clogh-or. It appears to have some very ancient characters engraved on it, but it evidently nothing more than the shaft of an antique cross of rude workmanship, of which there are several in the ancient cemetery. Clogher is called by [[Ptolemy]] Rhigia or Regia; and according to some authors, [[St. Patrick]] founded and presided over a monastery here, which he resigned to St. Kertenn when he went to Armagh, to establish his famous abbey there; but according to others, it was built at the command of St. Patrick in the street before the royal palace of Ergal, by St. Macartin, who died in 506, and from its vicinity to this palace both the abbey and the town appear anciently\".}}\n\nAn old folk-tale from the [[Isle of Man]] entitled \"\"The Story of the Isle of Falga\", based on the [[Ulster Cycle]] states:- \"''[[Conchobar mac Nessa|Conchobar]], who had not yet become King of Ulster, but was an ambitious young man seeking to gain a kingdom, consulted the famous oracle at Clogher as to how he might best attain his end. The oracle advised him to proceed to the Isle of Man and get Culann to make these weapons for him. Conchobar did so, and prevailed on Culann to begin his task; but, while awaiting its completion, he sauntered one morning along the shore, and in the course of his walk met with a mermaid fast asleep on the beach. He promptly bound the syren, but she, on waking and perceiving what had happened, besought him to liberate her; and to induce him to yield to her petition, she informed him that she was Teeval, the Princess of the Ocean; and promised that if he caused Culann to form her representation on the shield surrounded with this inscription, 'Teeval, Princess\u00b7of the Ocean,' it would possess such extraordinary powers that when ever he was about engaging his enemy in battle, and looked upon her figure on the shield, read the legend, and invoked her name, his enemies would diminish in strength, while he and his people would acquire a proportionate increase in theirs. Conchobar had the shield made according to the advice of Teeval, and, on his return to Ireland, such extraordinary success attended his arms, that he won the kingdom of Ulster. Culann accepted Conchobar's offer, referred to above, and settled on the plain of Murthemne, which was fabled to have been formerly situated beneath the sea. It was here that he was visited by Conchobar, accompanied by his Court and [[Cuchulainn]]''.\"\n\nIn a book entitled \"Omagh: Paintings and Stories from the Seat of the Chiefs\" by Dr Haldane Mitchell, there is a local Tyrone folk-tale about a giant called \"Ermand Kelstach\" and Muckabaw who fought for the hand of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]'s daughter Granua.

Eight tenets have been prescribed to preserve bio-diversity - although most adherents are unaware of that, or such things as [[global warming]], as a concept<ref name=\"jain52\"/> -  and encourage good [[animal husbandry]]. These include a ban on killing animals and felling green trees, and providing protection to all life forms. The community is also directed to see that the firewood they use is devoid of small insects. Wearing blue clothes is prohibited because the dye for colouring them is obtained by cutting a large quantity of shrubs.{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi gave the credit of Champion of Earth Award 2018 to Vishnoi Samaj.

{"title_page": "State Board of Equalization (California)", "text_new": "{{short description|Tax administration agency of California, United States}}\n{{update|date=April 2014}}\nThe '''State Board of Equalization''' (BOE) is a public agency charged with [[Tax|tax administration]] and [[Fee|fee collection]] in the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The authorities of the Board fall into four broad areas: [[Sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, special taxes, and acting as an appellate body for [[Franchise tax|franchise]] and [[income tax]] appeals (which are collected by the [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).<ref name=\"about\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/info/about.htm About BOE]</ref> The BOE is the only publicly elected tax commission in the United States.<ref name=\"members\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/members/board.htm Board Members]</ref> The board is made up of four directly elected members, each representing a [[Districts in California|district]] for four-year terms, along with the [[California State Controller|State Controller]], who is elected on a statewide basis, serving as the fifth member.  In June 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers, returning the agency to its original core responsibilities (originating in the State Constitution in 1879).\n\n==History==\nThe State Board of Equalization was created in 1879 by the ratification of the second [[Constitution of California]]. Its original mandate was to ensure that property [[tax assessment]]s were uniform and equal across all counties in the state.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nPrior to the creation of the state [[income tax]], [[sales tax]], and [[fuel tax]]es in the 1930s, California's state government was almost completely supported by [[property tax]]es, which were and still are assessed at the county level by elected tax assessors.  Assessors were tempted to boost their popularity with county voters by undervaluing voters' property (and thereby lowering their taxes).  This presented the risk of counties with honest assessors paying more than their fair share of the burden of operating the state government, so the Board of Equalization was created to equalize the burden.\n\nThe [[California Franchise Tax Board]] and the [[Employment Development Department]] are separately also responsible for collecting taxes.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> Some have criticized this as inefficient.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=lawreview Daniel L.

In 2004, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] released a 2,500-page report seeking to merge the Board with other agencies and then promoted a bill by Assemblywoman [[Lois Wolk]] to do just that. The effort failed.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> In 2008, the agency employed approximately 3,950 people throughout the state.<ref name=\"annual_report_districts_2008\">State Board of Equalization, 2007-2008 Annual Report, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/annual/pdf/2008/1-profile08.pdf Profile], \"Governance\" p. 3.</ref>\n\nBy 2017, the Board had expanded to collecting $60 billion a year. It collected sales and use taxes, hazardous waste fees, jet fuel taxes, marijuana taxes, and over 30 additional taxes. That year, the Board had 4,700 employees and a $617 million annual budget. Board members are paid a $137,000 annual salary and are each allowed to hire a 12-member staff.

of California, United States}}\n{{update|date=April 2014}}\nThe '''State Board of Equalization''' (BOE) is a public agency charged with [[Tax|tax administration]] and [[Fee|fee collection]] in the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The authorities of the Board fall into four broad areas: [[Sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, special taxes, and acting as an appellate body for [[Franchise tax|franchise]] and [[income tax]] appeals (which are collected by the [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).<ref name=\"about\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/info/about.htm About BOE]</ref> The BOE is the only publicly elected tax commission in the United States.<ref name=\"members\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/members/board.htm Board Members]</ref> The board is made up of four directly elected members, each representing a [[Districts in California|district]] for four-year terms, along with the [[California State Controller|State Controller]], who is elected on a statewide basis, serving as the fifth member.  In June 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers, returning the agency to its original core responsibilities (originating in the State Constitution in 1879).\n\n==History==\nThe State Board of Equalization was created in 1879 by the ratification of the second [[Constitution of California]]. Its original mandate was to ensure that property [[tax assessment]]s were uniform and equal across all counties in the state.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nPrior to the creation of the state [[income tax]], [[sales tax]], and [[fuel tax]]es in the 1930s, California's state government was almost completely supported by [[property tax]]es, which were and still are assessed at the county level by elected tax assessors.  Assessors were tempted to boost their popularity with county voters by undervaluing voters' property (and thereby lowering their taxes).  This presented the risk of counties with honest assessors paying more than their fair share of the burden of operating the state government, so the Board of Equalization was created to equalize the burden.\n\nThe [[California Franchise Tax Board]] and the [[Employment Development Department]] are separately also responsible for collecting taxes.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> Some have criticized this as inefficient.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=lawreview Daniel L. Simmons, ''California Tax Collection: Time for Reform''], 48 Santa Clara L. Rev. 279 (2008).</ref>  Efforts to reform the Board were made in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1990s, and 2000s.<ref name=SacBee23April17>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=For 90 years, Californians have tried to kill this tax board.

In 2004, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] released a 2,500-page report seeking to merge the Board with other agencies and then promoted a bill by Assemblywoman [[Lois Wolk]] to do just that. The effort failed.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> In 2008, the agency employed approximately 3,950 people throughout the state.<ref name=\"annual_report_districts_2008\">State Board of Equalization, 2007-2008 Annual Report, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/annual/pdf/2008/1-profile08.pdf Profile], \"Governance\" p. 3.</ref>\n\nBy 2017, the Board had expanded to collecting $60 billion a year. It collected sales and use taxes, hazardous waste fees, jet fuel taxes, marijuana taxes, and over 30 additional taxes. That year, the Board had 4,700 employees and a $617 million annual budget. Board members are paid a $137,000 annual salary and are each allowed to hire a 12-member staff. Each year, the Board spends at least $3 million on education events where elected members appear before their constituents.<ref name=SacBee23April17/>\n\nIn March 2017, an audit by the [[California Department of Finance]] revealed missing funds and signs of [[nepotism]], leading to calls for the governor to put the Board under a public trustee.<ref name=SacBee24March17>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Audit: California tax collectors on \u2018parking lot duty\u2019 for promotional events as politicos push boundaries|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article140474853.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=24 March 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Here\u2019s the audit shaking up the Board of Equalization|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article142026614.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=31 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>  In June 2017, the [[California Department of Justice]] began a criminal investigation into the members of the Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Criminal investigation targets California tax board leaders|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article157058439.html|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=20 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers.

He played as [[Forward (association football)|Striker]].\n\n== Club career ==\nWeber played his youth football with local club [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]]. He advanced to their first team in 1933. He played two seasons with Nordstern and then moved on to play one season for [[FC Bern]].\n\nWeber joined [[FC Basel]]'s first team under team manager [[Heinz K\u00f6rner]] for their [[1936\u201337 FC Basel season|1936\u201337 season]]. After three test games he played his domestic league debut for his new club in away game on 30 August 1936 as Basel were defeated 0\u20131 by his old club Bern.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-bern-fcb 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28187 | title = FC Bern - FC Basel 1:0 (1:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> He scored his first goal for his club on 25 April 1937 in the home game at the [[Landhof]] against [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]].

Only thanks to four consecutive victories towards the end of the campain lifted the team to finish in joint second last position in the league table. Because [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and Basel both had 20 points, they had to have a play-off against relegation. This was played in the [[Wankdorf Stadium]] in [[Bern]] on 13 June 1937. This ended goalless after 90 minutes. In over time La Chaux-de-Fonds took the lead, but Weber was able to equalise.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-play off 1 fcb-lcdf 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28211 | title = FC Basel - FC La Chaux-de-Fonds 1:1 n.V.

With 27 points Basel ended the season in fourth position. In his two seasons Weber played a total of 61 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 43 of these games were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalloga]], four in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 14 were friendly games.

He played as [[Forward (association football)|Striker]].\n\n== Club career ==\nWeber played his youth football with local club [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]]. He advanced to their first team in 1933. He played two seasons with Nordstern and then moved on to play one season for [[FC Bern]].\n\nWeber joined [[FC Basel]]'s first team under team manager [[Heinz K\u00f6rner]] for their [[1936\u201337 FC Basel season|1936\u201337 season]]. After three test games he played his domestic league debut for his new club in away game on 30 August 1936 as Basel were defeated 0\u20131 by his old club Bern.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-bern-fcb 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28187 | title = FC Bern - FC Basel 1:0 (1:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> He scored his first goal for his club on 25 April 1937 in the home game at the [[Landhof]] against [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]].

Only thanks to four consecutive victories towards the end of the campain lifted the team to finish in joint second last position in the league table. Because [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and Basel both had 20 points, they had to have a play-off against relegation. This was played in the [[Wankdorf Stadium]] in [[Bern]] on 13 June 1937. This ended goalless after 90 minutes. In over time La Chaux-de-Fonds took the lead, but Weber was able to equalise.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-play off 1 fcb-lcdf 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28211 | title = FC Basel - FC La Chaux-de-Fonds 1:1 n.V.

With 27 points Basel ended the season in fourth position. In his two seasons Weber played a total of 61 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 43 of these games were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalloga]], four in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 14 were friendly games. He scored 11 goals in the domestic league, two in the Cup and the others were scored during the test games.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Alfons Weber\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/spieler?command=detail&id=8965 | title = Alfons Weber - FCB-Statistik | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nWeber moved on and joined [[FC Lugano|Lugano]].

It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

This area includes suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of [[Hornsby Shire]], [[City of Ryde]], the [[Municipality of Hunter's Hill]] and parts of the [[City of Parramatta]].\n\nThe [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], an informal geographic term referring to the northern metropolitan area of Sydney, consists of {{NSWcity|Artarmon}}, {{NSWcity|Chatswood}}, {{NSWcity|Roseville}}, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}, [[Killara]], {{NSWcity|Gordon}}, {{NSWcity|Pymble}}, {{NSWcity|Hornsby}} and many others.\n\nThe Lower North Shore usually refers to the suburbs adjacent to the harbour such as {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}, {{NSWcity|Waverton}}, [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], {{NSWcity|Cremorne}}, [[Cremorne Point]], {{NSWcity|Lavender Bay}}, [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]], {{NSWcity|Cammeray}}, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]], and North Sydney. {{NSWcity|Hunters Hill}} and {{NSWcity|Gladesville}} are often also considered as being part of the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Liveable Sydney: The lower north shore's suburbs ranked by liveability|url=https://www.domain.com.au/news/liveable-sydney-lower-north-shore-ranked|date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The Lower North Shore's eastern boundary is [[Middle Harbour]], or at the [[Roseville Bridge]] at {{NSWcity|Castle Cove}} and {{NSWcity|Roseville Chase}}. The Upper North Shore usually refers to the suburbs between {{NSWcity|Chatswood}} and {{NSWcity|Hornsby}}. It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.
