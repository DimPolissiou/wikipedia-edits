Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A restaurant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s.

In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y; Z)'') where if ''Z'' is the scalar field then we may instead write ''L(X)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y)''). \n* We will denote the continuous dual space of ''X'' by X* or <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and the algebraic dual space (which is the vector space of all linear functionals on ''X'', whether continuous or not) by <math>X^{\\#}</math>. \n** To increase the clarity of the exposition, we use the common convention of writing elements of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> with a prime following the symbol (e.g. <math>x^{\\prime}</math> denotes an element of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and not, say, a derivative and the variables ''x'' and <math>x^{\\prime}</math> need not be related in any way). \n* A linear map <math>L : H \\to H</math> from a Hilbert space into itself is called '''positive''' if <math>\\langle L(x), X \\rangle \\geq 0</math> for every <math>x \\in H</math>. In this case, there is a unique positive map <math>r : H \\to H</math>, called the '''square-root''' of <math>L</math>, such that <math>L = r \\circ r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=488}} \n** If <math>L : H_1 \\to H_2</math> is any continuous linear map between Hilbert spaces, then <math>L^* \\circ L</math> is always positive. Now let <math>R : H \\to H</math> denote its positive square-root, which is called the '''absolute value''' of ''L''. Define <math>U : H_1 \\to H_2</math> first on <math>\\operatorname{Im} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = L(x)</math> for <math>x = R \\left( x_1 \\right) \\in \\operatorname{Im} R</math> and extending <math>U</math> continuously to <math>\\overline{\\operatorname{Im} R}</math>, and then define ''U'' on <math>\\operatorname{ker} R</math> by setting <math>U(x) = 0</math> for <math>x \\in \\operatorname{ker} R</math> and extend this map linearly to all of <math>H_1</math>. The map <math>U\\big\\vert_{\\operatorname{Im} R} : \\operatorname{Im} R \\to \\operatorname{Im} L</math> is a surjective isometry and <math>L = U \\circ R</math>. \n* A linear map <math>\\Lambda : X \\to Y</math> is called '''compact''' or '''completely continuous''' if there is a neighborhood ''U'' of the origin in ''X'' such that <math>\\Lambda(U)</math> is [[precompact]] in ''Y''.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=483}}\n** In a Hilbert space, positive compact linear operators, say <math>L : H \\to H</math> have a simple spectral decomposition discovered at the beginning of the 20th century by Fredholm and F.

This gives us a canonical tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nIf ''Z'' is any other vector space then the mapping <math>Li(X \\otimes Y; Z) \\to Bi(X, Y; Z)</math> given by <math>u \\mapsto u \\circ \\chi</math> is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In particular, this allows us to identify the [[algebraic dual]] of ''X \u2297 Y'' with the space of bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=92}} Moreover, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs) and if ''X \u2297 Y'' is given the \ud835\udf0b-topology then for every locally convex TVS ''Z'', this map restricts to a vector space isomorphism <math>L(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y; Z) \\to B(X, Y; Z)</math> from the space of ''continuous'' linear mappings onto the space of ''continuous'' bilinear mappings.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}} In particular, the continuous dual of ''X \u2297 Y'' can be canonically identified with the space ''B(X, Y)'' of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>; furthermore, under this identification the [[equicontinuous]] subsets of ''B(X, Y)'' are the same as the equicontinuous subsets of ''<math>(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y)^{\\prime}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}\n\n== The projective tensor product ==\n=== Tensor product of seminorms ===\nThroughout we will let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[locally convex]] [[topological vector spaces]] (local convexity allows us to define useful topologies{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}). \nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' then <math>C_p := \\{ x \\in X : p(x) \\leq 1 \\}</math> will be its closed unit ball. \n\nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' and ''q'' is a seminorm on ''Y'' then we can define the '''tensor product of ''p'' and ''q''''' to be the map ''p \u2297 q'' defined on ''X \u2297 Y'' by \n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf_{r > 0, b \\in r W} r</math>\nwhere ''W'' is the [[balanced]] convex hull of <math>C_p \\otimes C_q = \\left\\{ x \\otimes y : p(x) \\leq 1, q(y) \\leq 1 \\right\\}</math>. \nGiven ''b'' in ''X \u2297 Y'', this can also be expressed as{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=435}}\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf \\sum_i p(x_i) q(y_i)</math>\nwhere the infimum is taken over all finite sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> (of the same length) such that <math>b = x_1 \\otimes y_1 + \\cdots + x_n \\otimes y_n</math> (recall that it may not be possible to express ''b'' as a [[simple tensor]]). \nIf ''b = x\u2297y'' then we have\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(x \\otimes y) = p(x) q(y)</math>.\nThe seminorm ''p \u2297 q'' is a norm if and only if both ''p'' and ''q'' are norms.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=437}} \n\nIf the topology of ''X'' (resp.

In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y; Z)'') where if ''Z'' is the scalar field then we may instead write ''L(X)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y)''). \n* We will denote the continuous dual space of ''X'' by X* or <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and the algebraic dual space (which is the vector space of all linear functionals on ''X'', whether continuous or not) by <math>X^{\\#}</math>. \n** To increase the clarity of the exposition, we use the common convention of writing elements of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> with a prime following the symbol (e.g. <math>x^{\\prime}</math> denotes an element of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and not, say, a derivative and the variables ''x'' and <math>x^{\\prime}</math> need not be related in any way). \n* A linear map <math>L : H \\to H</math> from a Hilbert space into itself is called '''positive''' if <math>\\langle L(x), X \\rangle \\geq 0</math> for every <math>x \\in H</math>. In this case, there is a unique positive map <math>r : H \\to H</math>, called the '''square-root''' of <math>L</math>, such that <math>L = r \\circ r</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=488}} \n** If <math>L : H_1 \\to H_2</math> is any continuous linear map between Hilbert spaces, then <math>L^* \\circ L</math> is always positive.

In particular, if <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is absolutely summable in a Hausdorff locally convex TVS ''X'' whose topology is generated by the family of seminorm <math>\\left( p_{\\beta} \\right)</math>, then for every <math>p_{\\beta}</math>, all but countably many of the terms in <math>\\left( p-{\\beta} \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right) \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> are 0. In particular, if ''X'' is metrizable and locally convex then at most countably many terms in an absolutely summable family are non-0. --> \nA metrizable locally convex space is [[nuclear space|nuclear]] if and only if every summable sequence is absolutely summable.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=184}} It follows that a normable space in which every summable sequence is absolutely summable, is necessarily finite dimensional.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=184}}\n\nWe now define a topology on <math>S_a</math> in a very natural way. This topology turns out to be the projective topology taken from <math>l^1(A) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X</math> and transferred to <math>S_a</math> via a canonical vector space isomorphism (the obvious one). This is a common occurrence when studying the injective and projective tensor products of function/sequence spaces and TVSs: the \"natural way\" in which one would define (from scratch) a topology on such a tensor product is frequently equivalent to the projective or [[injective tensor product]] topology.  \n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{U}</math> denote a base of convex balanced neighborhoods of 0 in ''X'' and for each <math>U \\in \\mathfrak{U}</math>, let <math>\\mu_U : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> denote its [[Minkowski functional]]. For any such ''U'' and any <math>x = \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A} \\in S_a</math>, let <math>p_U(x) := \\sum_{\\alpha \\in A} \\mu_U\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)</math> where <math>p_U</math> defines a seminorm on <math>S_a</math>. The family of seminorms <math>\\{ p_U : U \\in \\mathfrak{U} \\}</math> generates a topology making <math>S_a</math> into a locally convex space. The vector space <math>S_a</math> endowed with this topology will be denoted by <math>l^1[A, X]</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | pp=179-184}} The special case where ''X'' is the scalar field will be denoted by <math>l^1[A]</math>. \n\nThere is a canonical embedding of vector spaces <math>l^1(A) \\otimes X \\to l^1[A, E]</math> defined by linearizing the bilinear map <math>l^1(A) \\times X \\to l^1[A, E]</math> defined by <math>\\left( \\left( r_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}, x \\right) \\mapsto \\left( r_{\\alpha} x \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | pp=179-184}} \n\n'''Theorem''':{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | pp=179-184}} The canonical embedding (of vector spaces) <math>l^1(A) \\otimes X \\to l^1[A, E]</math> becomes an embedding of topological vector spaces <math>l^1(A) \\otimes_{\\pi} X \\to l^1[A, E]</math>, when <math>l^1(A) \\otimes X</math> is given the projective topology. The continuous extension <math>l^1(A) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X \\to l^1[A, E]</math> of this embedding is an isomorphism of TVSs.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Auxiliary normed spaces]]\n* [[Initial topology]]\n* [[Inductive tensor product]]\n* [[Injective tensor product]]\n* [[Integral map]]s\n* [[Nuclear operator]]s\n* [[Nuclear space]]s\n* [[Tensor product of Hilbert spaces]]\n* [[Topological tensor product]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | last=Diestel | first=Joe | title=The metric theory of tensor products : Grothendieck's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 revisited | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence, R.I | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-4440-7 | oclc=185095773 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Diestel | 2008 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Dubinsky | first=Ed | title=The structure of nuclear Fr\u00e9chet spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1979 | isbn=3-540-09504-7 | oclc=5126156 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Dubinsky | 1979 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Grothendieck | first=Grothendieck | title=Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucl\u00e9aires | publisher=American Mathematical Society | publication-place=Providence | year=1966 | isbn=0-8218-1216-5 | oclc=1315788 | language=fr | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Grothendieck | 1966 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Husain | first=Taqdir | title=Barrelledness in topological and ordered vector spaces | publisher=Springer-Verlag | publication-place=Berlin New York | year=1978 | isbn=3-540-09096-7 | oclc=4493665 | ref=harv}} <!-- {{sfn | Husain | 1978 | p=}} -->\n* {{cite book | last=Khaleelulla | first=S.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.
