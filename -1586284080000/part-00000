EZH2 inhibitor development has focused on targeting the [[SET domain]] active site of the protein. Several inhibitors of EZH2 have been developed as of 2015, including [[3-Deazaneplanocin A|3-deazaneplanocin A]] (DZNep), EPZ005687, EI1, GSK126, and UNC1999. DZNep has potential antiviral and anti-cancer properties because it lowers EZH2 levels and induces [[apoptosis]] in breast and colon cancer cells.<ref name=\"pmid17437993\"/> DZNep inhibits the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), which is a product-based inhibitor of all protein methyltransferases, leading to increased cellular concentrations of SAH which in turn inhibits EZH2. However, DZNep is not specific to EZH2 and also inhibits other DNA methyltransferases.\n\nIn 2012, a company called Epizyme revealed EPZ005687, an S-adenosylmethionine ([[S-adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme|SAM]]) competitive inhibitor that is more selective than DZNep; it has a 50-fold increase in selectivity for EZH2 compared to [[EZH1]]. The drug blocks EZH2 activity by binding to the SET domain active site of the enzyme. EPZ005687 can also inhibit the Y641 and A677 mutants of EZH2, which may be applicable for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid23023262\"/> In 2013, Epizyme began Phase I clinical trials with another EZH2 inhibitor, [[tazemetostat]] (EPZ-6438), for patients with B-cell lymphoma.<ref>Epizyme Announces Clinical Data from Phase 1 Trial of EZH2 Inhibitor EPZ-6438 (E7438) to be Presented at EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. (2014, October 1).</ref> In 2020, [[tazemetostat]], with the tradename Tazverik, was FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma.\n\nSinefungin is another SAM-competitive inhibitor, however, like DZNep, it is not specific to EZH2.<ref name=\"pmid16682405\"/> It works by binding in the cofactor binding pocket of DNA methyltransferases to block methyl transfer. EI1 is another inhibitor, developed by [[Novartis]], that showed EZH2 inhibitory activity in lymphoma tumor cells, including cells with the Y641 mutation.<ref name=\"pmid23236167\"/> The mechanism of this inhibitor also involves competing with the SAM cofactor for binding to EZH2.<ref name=\"pmid23236167\" /> GSK126 is a potent, SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitor developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], that has 150-fold selectivity over EZH1 and a K<sub>i</sub> of 0.5-3 nM.<ref name=\"McCabe_2012\"/> UNC1999 was developed as an analogue of GSK126, and was the first orally bioavailable EZH2 inhibitor to show activity. However, it is less selective than its counterpart GSK126, and it binds to EZH1 as well, increasing the potential for off-target effects.\n\nCombination therapies are being studied as possible treatments when primary treatments begin to fail. [[Etoposide]], a [[topoisomerase]] inhibitor, when combined with an EZH2 inhibitor, becomes more effective for non-small cell lung cancers with [[BRG1]] and [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] mutations.<ref name=\"url_HMS\" /> However, EZH2 and lysine methylation can have tumor suppressing activity, for example in [[myelodysplastic syndrome]],<ref name=\"pmid20601954\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikoloski G, Langemeijer SM, Kuiper RP, Knops R, Massop M, T\u00f6nnissen ER, van der Heijden A, Scheele TN, Vandenberghe P, de Witte T, van der Reijden BA, Jansen JH | displayauthors = 6 | title = Somatic mutations of the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 in myelodysplastic syndromes | journal = Nat.

EZH2 inhibitor development has focused on targeting the [[SET domain]] active site of the protein. Several inhibitors of EZH2 have been developed as of 2015, including [[3-Deazaneplanocin A|3-deazaneplanocin A]] (DZNep), EPZ005687, EI1, GSK126, and UNC1999. DZNep has potential antiviral and anti-cancer properties because it lowers EZH2 levels and induces [[apoptosis]] in breast and colon cancer cells.<ref name=\"pmid17437993\"/> DZNep inhibits the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), which is a product-based inhibitor of all protein methyltransferases, leading to increased cellular concentrations of SAH which in turn inhibits EZH2. However, DZNep is not specific to EZH2 and also inhibits other DNA methyltransferases.\n\nIn 2012, a company called Epizyme revealed EPZ005687, an S-adenosylmethionine ([[S-adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme|SAM]]) competitive inhibitor that is more selective than DZNep; it has a 50-fold increase in selectivity for EZH2 compared to [[EZH1]]. The drug blocks EZH2 activity by binding to the SET domain active site of the enzyme. EPZ005687 can also inhibit the Y641 and A677 mutants of EZH2, which may be applicable for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid23023262\"/> In 2013, Epizyme began Phase I clinical trials with another EZH2 inhibitor, [[tazemetostat]] (EPZ-6438), for patients with B-cell lymphoma.<ref>Epizyme Announces Clinical Data from Phase 1 Trial of EZH2 Inhibitor EPZ-6438 (E7438) to be Presented at EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. (2014, October 1).</ref> In 2020, [[tazemetostat]], with the tradename Tazverik, was FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma.\n\nSinefungin is another SAM-competitive inhibitor, however, like DZNep, it is not specific to EZH2.<ref name=\"pmid16682405\"/> It works by binding in the cofactor binding pocket of DNA methyltransferases to block methyl transfer. EI1 is another inhibitor, developed by [[Novartis]], that showed EZH2 inhibitory activity in lymphoma tumor cells, including cells with the Y641 mutation.<ref name=\"pmid23236167\"/> The mechanism of this inhibitor also involves competing with the SAM cofactor for binding to EZH2.<ref name=\"pmid23236167\" /> GSK126 is a potent, SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitor developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], that has 150-fold selectivity over EZH1 and a K<sub>i</sub> of 0.5-3 nM.<ref name=\"McCabe_2012\"/> UNC1999 was developed as an analogue of GSK126, and was the first orally bioavailable EZH2 inhibitor to show activity. However, it is less selective than its counterpart GSK126, and it binds to EZH1 as well, increasing the potential for off-target effects.\n\nCombination therapies are being studied as possible treatments when primary treatments begin to fail. [[Etoposide]], a [[topoisomerase]] inhibitor, when combined with an EZH2 inhibitor, becomes more effective for non-small cell lung cancers with [[BRG1]] and [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] mutations.<ref name=\"url_HMS\" /> However, EZH2 and lysine methylation can have tumor suppressing activity, for example in [[myelodysplastic syndrome]],<ref name=\"pmid20601954\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikoloski G, Langemeijer SM, Kuiper RP, Knops R, Massop M, T\u00f6nnissen ER, van der Heijden A, Scheele TN, Vandenberghe P, de Witte T, van der Reijden BA, Jansen JH | displayauthors = 6 | title = Somatic mutations of the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 in myelodysplastic syndromes | journal = Nat.

Dixit seeks the help of a local bike dealer/racer named '''Ali Akbar Fateh Khan''' ([[Uday Chopra]]) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. '''Kabir''' ([[John Abraham]]), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit, claiming that Dixit can't catch him even if he is right in front of him. He is proven correct and Dixit's failure apparently causes him to part ways with Ali.\n\nKabir then lures Ali into his gang as a substitute for Rohit, the gang member who was killed by Dixit. Ali falls in love with '''Sheena''' ([[Esha Deol]]), another gang member. The gang later goes to [[Goa]] to perform one last big heist before disbanding forever. Kabir sets his eyes on the largest casino in all of India. Kabir and his gang swiftly loot the casino on [[New Year's Eve]], but they soon realize that Dixit has led them right into a trap. It is revealed that Ali was working for Dixit the whole time, and a fight ensues.\n\nKabir manages to escape from Dixit and goes back to the gang's truck where Ali has kept Sheena bound and gagged. Kabir then viciously beats up Ali for his betrayal, but Ali is saved by Dixit's timely arrival at the scene. The gang flees, except for Sheena, while Dixit and Ali give chase to Kabir. They kill all the other gang members except Kabir, who tries to escape on his bike. He is cornered by Dixit and Ali with nowhere to go. Kabir decides to take his own life rather than let Dixit arrest him, and he rides his bike over the edge of a cliff into the water to his death. The film ends with Dixit and Ali arguing with each other, albeit in a friendly way.\n\n==Cast==<!-- John Abraham does NOT come first in the credits, so DON'T CHANGE THE BILLING.

Dixit seeks the help of a local bike dealer/racer named '''Ali Akbar Fateh Khan''' ([[Uday Chopra]]) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. '''Kabir''' ([[John Abraham]]), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit, claiming that Dixit can't catch him even if he is right in front of him. He is proven correct and Dixit's failure apparently causes him to part ways with Ali.\n\nKabir then lures Ali into his gang as a substitute for Rohit, the gang member who was killed by Dixit. Ali falls in love with '''Sheena''' ([[Esha Deol]]), another gang member. The gang later goes to [[Goa]] to perform one last big heist before disbanding forever. Kabir sets his eyes on the largest casino in all of India. Kabir and his gang swiftly loot the casino on [[New Year's Eve]], but they soon realize that Dixit has led them right into a trap. It is revealed that Ali was working for Dixit the whole time, and a fight ensues.\n\nKabir manages to escape from Dixit and goes back to the gang's truck where Ali has kept Sheena bound and gagged. Kabir then viciously beats up Ali for his betrayal, but Ali is saved by Dixit's timely arrival at the scene. The gang flees, except for Sheena, while Dixit and Ali give chase to Kabir. They kill all the other gang members except Kabir, who tries to escape on his bike. He is cornered by Dixit and Ali with nowhere to go. Kabir decides to take his own life rather than let Dixit arrest him, and he rides his bike over the edge of a cliff into the water to his death. The film ends with Dixit and Ali arguing with each other, albeit in a friendly way.\n\n==Cast==<!-- John Abraham does NOT come first in the credits, so DON'T CHANGE THE BILLING.

This large-scale work, a [[missa solemnis]], is scored for two [[soprano]] soloists, a [[tenor]] and a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], double chorus and large orchestra. It remained unfinished, missing large portions of the Credo and the complete Agnus Dei.\n\n==Composition and first performance==\n{{See also|List of masses by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}\n\nThe work was composed during 1782/83. In a letter to his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] dated 4 January 1783, Mozart mentioned a vow he had made to write a mass when he would bring his then fianc\u00e9e [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] as his wife to Salzburg to meet his family for the first time after his father's earlier opposition. Constanze then sang the \"Et incarnatus est\" at its premiere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.zeno.org/nid/20007749740|first=Alfred|last=Einstein|authorlink=Alfred Einstein|title=Mozart. Sein Charakter, sein Werk|chapter=Kirchenmusik|language=German|location=Zurich, Stuttgart|year=1953|pages=362\u2013403}}</ref>\n\nThe first performance took place in [[Salzburg]] on Sunday 26 October 1783 (the twentieth Sunday after Pentecost).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Mozart had moved to Vienna in 1781, but was paying a visit to his home town in the company of Constanze, who had not yet met his father or his sister ([[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]).\n\nThe performance consisted of just the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Benedictus, as surviving parts and a score copy form ca. 1800 show. It took place in the Church of [[St Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg|St. Peter's Abbey]] in the context of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]. Mozart's sister's diary mentions that the performers were the entire \"{{Lang|de|Hofmusik}}\", that is the musicians employed at the court of Salzburg's ruler, [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop]] [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo]] and thus Mozart's former colleagues.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1965, 219\">Deutsch 1965, 219</ref> There was a rehearsal in the nearby Kapellhaus on 23 October 1783.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1965, 219\" />\n\n==Fragmentary status==\n{{Multiple image|center|header=Autograph of two of the pages of the mass (\"Kyrie\")|image1=Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p1.jpg|width1=250|image2=Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p2.jpg|width2=250|footer=Larger version of [[Media:Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p1.jpg|page 1]] (recto) and [[Media:Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p2.jpg|page 2]] (verso)}}\n\nThe work is incomplete, missing the ''[[Credo]]'' movements following the aria \"Et incarnatus est\" (the orchestration of the only two surviving ''Credo'' movements being incomplete) and all of the ''[[Agnus Dei]]''. The ''[[Sanctus]]'' is partially lost and requires editorial reconstruction. The Benedictus only survives in the above-mentioned score copy. There is a good deal of speculation concerning why the work was left unfinished. For purposes of modern performances, the editions and completions available are those by Alois Schmitt (1901, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]), [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] (1956, [[Eulenburg]]), Helmut Eder (1985, [[B\u00e4renreiter]]), Franz Beyer (1989, Amadeus/[[Edition Peters]]), Richard Maunder (1990, [[Oxford University Press]]/[[Carus Verlag]]), Philip Wilby (2004, [[Novello & Co|Novello]]), [[Robert D. Levin|Robert Levin]] (2005, [[Carus-Verlag]]), and Clemens Kemme (2018, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]). \nThe editions by Landon, Eder, Beyer, Maunder and Kemme aim to simply fill out the missing orchestrations and choral parts in the Credo and Sanctus, whereas the editions by Schmitt, Wilby and Levin aim to complete the work by either using movements from other masses or composing new music for the Credo and Agnus Dei through the use of parody or elaboration of period sketches by Mozart.\n[[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]] ([[Musikproduktion H\u00f6flich]]) just offers a complete Credo and an Agnus Dei. For the Credo this means a completions of the \u2018Credo in unum Deum\u2019 and the \u2018Et incarnatus est\u2019 and additional music for the rest of the Credo. This edition, therefore, is intended to be used in combination with any other version of the Mass.\n[[Robert Xavier Rodriguez]] has also completed the Agnus Dei.<ref>[http://www.schirmer.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2420&State_2874=2&workId_2874=35027# \"Robert Xavier Rodr\u00edguez: Agnus Dei (completion of Mozart's Mass in C minor)], [[G. Schirmer Inc.]]</ref> \n\nMozart later reused the music from the ''Kyrie'' and ''Gloria'', almost without changes except for the text, in the [[cantata]] ''[[Davide penitente]]'', K.&nbsp;469.\n\n==Structure==\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=W.

It took place in the Church of [[St Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg|St. Peter's Abbey]] in the context of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]. Mozart's sister's diary mentions that the performers were the entire \"{{Lang|de|Hofmusik}}\", that is the musicians employed at the court of Salzburg's ruler, [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop]] [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo]] and thus Mozart's former colleagues.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1965, 219\">Deutsch 1965, 219</ref> There was a rehearsal in the nearby Kapellhaus on 23 October 1783.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1965, 219\" />\n\n==Fragmentary status==\n{{Multiple image|center|header=Autograph of two of the pages of the mass (\"Kyrie\")|image1=Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p1.jpg|width1=250|image2=Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p2.jpg|width2=250|footer=Larger version of [[Media:Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p1.jpg|page 1]] (recto) and [[Media:Great Mass in C minor (Mozart) p2.jpg|page 2]] (verso)}}\n\nThe work is incomplete, missing the ''[[Credo]]'' movements following the aria \"Et incarnatus est\" (the orchestration of the only two surviving ''Credo'' movements being incomplete) and all of the ''[[Agnus Dei]]''. The ''[[Sanctus]]'' is partially lost and requires editorial reconstruction. The Benedictus only survives in the above-mentioned score copy. There is a good deal of speculation concerning why the work was left unfinished. For purposes of modern performances, the editions and completions available are those by Alois Schmitt (1901, Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel), [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] (1956, [[Eulenburg|Eulenburg]]), Helmut Eder (1985, [[B\u00e4renreiter]]), Franz Beyer (1989, Amadeus/[[Edition Peters]]), Richard Maunder (1990, [[Oxford University Press]]/[[Carus Verlag]]), Philip Wilby (2004, [[Novello & Co|Novello]]), [[Robert D. Levin|Robert Levin]] (2005, [[Carus-Verlag]], and Clemens Kemme (2018, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]). \nThe editions by Landon, Eder, Beyer, Maunder and Kemme aim to simply fill out the missing orchestrations and choral parts in the Credo and Sanctus, whereas the editions by Schmitt, Wilby and Levin aim to complete the work by either using movements from other masses or composing new music for the Credo and Agnus Dei through the use of parody or elaboration of period sketches by Mozart.\n[[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]] ([[Musikproduktion H\u00f6flich]]) just offers a complete Credo and an Agnus Dei. For the Credo this means a completions of the \u2018Credo in unum Deum\u2019 and the \u2018Et incarnatus est\u2019 and additional music for the rest of the Credo. This edition, therefore, is intended to be used in combination with any other version of the Mass.\n[[Robert Xavier Rodriguez]] has also completed the Agnus Dei.<ref>[http://www.schirmer.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2420&State_2874=2&workId_2874=35027# \"Robert Xavier Rodr\u00edguez: Agnus Dei (completion of Mozart's Mass in C minor)], [[G.

Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite assumed that Christian was \"a nut\" and attempted to discourage him by giving a quote several times higher than any project the company had taken, explaining that the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. Christian accepted the quote.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/> When arranging payment, Christian explained that he represented a group which had been planning the guidestones for 20 years, and which intended to remain anonymous.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/>\n\nChristian delivered a scale model of the guidestones and ten pages of specifications.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/> The five-acre<ref

monument, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a [[time capsule]] buried under the tablet, but spaces on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened have not been inscribed, so it is uncertain if the time capsule was put in place.\n\nThe complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below. The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, and misspells the word \"pseudonym\". The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows (letter case is not). At the top center of the tablet is written:\n\n{{quote|\nThe Georgia Guidestones<br />\nCenter cluster erected March 22, 1980\n}}\n\nImmediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:\n\n{{quote|\nLet these be guidestones to an Age of Reason\n}}\n\nAround the edges of the square are written translations to four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are: [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] (in [[cuneiform]] script), [[Classical Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] (in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]).\n\n[[File:Georgia Guidestones 04.jpg|thumb|The guidestones' \"Astronomic Features\"]]\n[[File:Georgia Guidestones 19.jpg|thumb|Undated instructions for the site's time capsule]]\nOn the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:\n{{quote|\n'''Astronomic Features'''<br />\n1.

Christian approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company on behalf of \"a small group of loyal Americans\", and commissioned the structure. Christian explained that the stones would function as a compass, calendar, and clock, and should be capable of withstanding catastrophic events. Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite assumed that Christian was \"a nut\" and attempted to discourage him by giving a quote several times higher than any project the company had taken, explaining that the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. Christian accepted the quote.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/> When arranging payment, Christian explained that he represented a group which had been planning the guidestones for 20 years, and which intended to remain anonymous.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/>\n\nChristian delivered a scale model of the guidestones and ten pages of specifications.<ref name=\"Sullivan 2009\"/> The five-acre<ref

monument, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a [[time capsule]] buried under the tablet, but spaces on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened have not been inscribed, so it is uncertain if the time capsule was put in place.\n\nThe complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below. The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, and misspells the word \"pseudonym\". The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows (letter case is not). At the top center of the tablet is written:\n\n{{quote|\nThe Georgia Guidestones<br />\nCenter cluster erected March 22, 1980\n}}\n\nImmediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:\n\n{{quote|\nLet these be guidestones to an Age of Reason\n}}\n\nAround the edges of the square are written translations to four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are: [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] (in [[cuneiform]] script), [[Classical Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] (in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]).\n\n[[File:Georgia Guidestones 04.jpg|thumb|The guidestones' \"Astronomic Features\"]]\n[[File:Georgia Guidestones 19.jpg|thumb|Undated instructions for the site's time capsule]]\nOn the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:\n{{quote|\n'''Astronomic Features'''<br />\n1.

Prophylactic antibiotics are considered to prevent urinary tract infections as those with NBS often have congenital kidney malformations.
