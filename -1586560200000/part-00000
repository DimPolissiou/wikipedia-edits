Key players for these 49ers included running back [[Ken Willard]], quarterback [[John Brodie]], and offensive lineman [[Bruce Bosley]]. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the [[shotgun formation]]. It was named by the man who actually devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach [[Red Hickey]], in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw.

In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In [[1962 NFL season|1962]], the [[1962 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in [[1963 NFL season|1963]]. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The [[1964 NFL season|1964 season]] was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Year Book the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, [[Albert J. Ruffo]], [[Franklin Mieuli]], [[Frankie Albert]], Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The [[1965 NFL season|1965]] [[1965 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In [[1966 NFL season|1966]], the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia, team president. For the [[1968 NFL season|1968 season]], the 49ers hired as their head coach [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had been [[Tom Landry]]'s defensive coordinator with the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7\u20136\u20131 and 4\u20138\u20132.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/Team/year-by-year-results.pdf|title=49ers Yearly Results and Statistics National Football League (1950-present)|last=|first=|date=|work=2016 Season Media Guide|publisher=|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171035/http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/Team/year-by-year-results.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers started out the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]] 7\u20131\u20131, their only loss a one-point defeat to [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]]. After losses to [[1970 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] and [[1970 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], the 49ers won their next two games before the season finale against the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. Going into the game the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or the [[1970 New York Giants season|Giants]] to defeat the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first ever divisional title.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion [[1970 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], thus setting up a matchup against the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at [[Kezar Stadium]] the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17\u201310, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the [[1970 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] that season, including MVP veteran quarterback [[John Brodie]], wide receiver [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], and linebacker [[Dave Wilcox]]. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from [[Kezar Stadium]] to [[Candlestick Park]]. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers won their second straight divisional title in 1971 with a 9\u20135 record. The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] by a 24\u201320 final score. This set up a rematch against the [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFC championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the [[1972 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], including defensive back [[Jimmy Johnson (cornerback)|Jimmy Johnson]] and [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end [[Cedric Hardman]], running back [[Vic Washington]], and offensive lineman [[Forrest Blue]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|title=1971 NFL Pro Bowlers {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/656dqxh9G?url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|archive-date=January 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in [[1972 NFL season|1972]] with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. Their opponents this time in the divisional playoffs were the [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the 4th quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], who was backing up [[Craig Morton]], into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting [[Billy Parks]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker [[Toni Fritsch]] then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by [[Mel Renfro]], giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to [[Billy Parks]] who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to [[Ron Sellers]] with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory and sending the 49ers to yet another crushing playoff defeat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran [[1973 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1973 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback [[John Brodie]] split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup [[Steve Spurrier]]. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with [[Vic Washington]] leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the 49ers drafted [[Wilbur Jackson]] from the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back [[Larry Schreiber]] combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With [[Steve Spurrier]] injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end [[Ted Kwalick]] left the 49ers to join the [[World Football League]], then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and [[Delvin Williams]] led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. [[Monte Clark]] was also brought on as 49ers head coach.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in [[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by [[Tommy Hart]]. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager [[Joe Thomas (American football executive)|Joe Thomas]], who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Meyer]] the 49ers lost their first five games of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen [[Tommy Hart]] and [[Cleveland Elam]], who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs [[Wilbur Jackson]] and [[Delvin Williams]], who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back [[O. J. Simpson]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]]. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with [[Pete McCulley]], his third coach in three seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|title=49ers Name McCulley Coach|website=washingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the [[1978 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 draft]] was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], [[Joe Montana]]'s first mentor, was the 49ers starting quarterback. Running back [[Paul Hofer]] and center/guard [[Randy Cross]] also started with the 49ers in 1978.\n\n===1979\u20131980: Arrival of Bill Walsh and Joe Montana===\n[[File:DeBartolo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of [[The DeBartolo Corporation]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]-based DeBartolo-York family.]]\n\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] and head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. The former head coach of [[Stanford University]] was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of [[Paul Brown]], and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Desiring head coach experience, Walsh looked to [[Stanford University]] in 1977. He had had some success there before the 49ers tapped him to be their replacement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the '[[West Coast offense]]'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach [[Sid Gillman]], and San Diego State coach [[Don Coryell]], who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and [[San Diego Chargers]] during a period where it garnered the nickname \"[[Coryell Offense|Air Coryell]]\".){{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]] as an early round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Fighting Irish]] to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the [[1979 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Playing the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n[[File:Joe Montana ESPN cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joe Montana]] in 2006]]\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200&nbsp;lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Danny White]], and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted [[Doug Cosbie]]. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver [[Dwight Clark]] in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of [[Clemson University]] as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into the coach's keen eye for talent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), [[Steve DeBerg]] blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and [[O.J. Simpson]], in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the early 1970s who alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]], and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the late 1940s alternating [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and [[Bob Waterfield]].\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|title=1980 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093129/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the [[New Orleans Saints]], who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by [[Joe Montana]], the 49ers made (what was then) the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] with a field goal by [[Ray Wersching]] to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were [[Dwight Clark]], who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back [[Earl Cooper (NFL)|Earl Cooper]], who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n===1981\u20131984: First two Super Bowls===\n{{See also|1981 San Francisco 49ers season|The Catch (American football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XVI]].]]\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric C. Wright|Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]] and giving [[Dwight Hicks]] a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker [[Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds]] and veteran defensive lineman and sack specialist [[Fred Dean]]. These new additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like [[Keena Turner]], turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; up to this point in time it was the team's best regular season win-loss record in its history. Dean made the [[Pro Bowl]], as did Lott, and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the [[west coast offense|short passing game]], which Walsh used as ball control. Both Dwight Clark and [[Freddie Solomon]] had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. [[Ricky Patton]] led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass-catching back. The 49ers faced the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times before, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark in the end zone, who leaped up and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (now known as \"[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. Despite this, the Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] caught a pass from Danny White and got to midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers 44-yard line by Cornerback Eric Wright saving a potential late-touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by [[Lawrence Pillers]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by [[Jim Stuckey]], giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first ever Super Bowl against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who were also in their first Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XVI]] The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker [[Ray Wersching]]'s four field goals and a key defensive stand. Throughout the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite residing in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12 play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. Thus did the 49ers complete one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season followed by a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 1982 season was a bad one for the 49ers, as they lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This was the 49ers last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Roger Craig (''middle'') and Joe Montana (''right'') led the 49ers to their second Super Bowl victory ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]) in four seasons.]]\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games of the season, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and winning their 2nd NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season, passing for 3,910 yards and connecting on 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, they hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped out in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]] on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 left on the clock to put the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when a potential game-winning FG attempt by Lions kicker [[Eddie Murray (American football)|Eddie Murray]] missed. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the NFC championship game to tie the game, only to lose, after a questionable defensive holding call, 24\u201321 on a Mark Moseley field goal that sent the Redskins to [[Super Bowl XVIII]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 [[Chicago Bears]], the 1998 [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 2004 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the 2011 [[Green Bay Packers]] and finally broken by the 2007 [[New England Patriots]] (with 16 regular season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (they won 18 straight, but lost [[Super Bowl XLII]] to the [[New York Giants]]). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker [[Ray Wersching]] went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the [[New York Giants]] 21\u201310, shut out the [[Chicago Bears]] 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in [[Super Bowl XIX]] the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP [[Dan Marino]] (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\n===1985\u20131987: Arrival of Jerry Rice===\nIn the [[1985 NFL Draft]], the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected [[Jerry Rice]] from [[Mississippi Valley State University|Mississippi Valley State]]. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the [[New York Giants]] 17\u20133.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|title=Giants Stop 49ers in Wild-Card Playoff, 17-3|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=December 30, 1985|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813060009/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the [[injured reserve list]], [[Jeff Kemp]] became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]], to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]]. However, the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' [[Jim Burt (football player)|Jim Burt]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | title=Montana Is Hospitalized for Concussion | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | date=January 5, 1987 | work=The New York Times | access-date=December 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204070453/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | archive-date=February 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for [[Steve Young]], then a quarterback with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving and/or touchdown receptions, he was named [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24|NFC divisional round]], losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] team, their third straight playoff loss in a row. Joe Montana had one of his worst post-season games of his career, and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo]] stripped Walsh of the team president title.

Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the [[1988 NFL season]], the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, [[Ronnie Lott]] called a players-only meeting; after the meeting the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1988 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] for the NFC championship against the [[Chicago Bears]], where the wind chill factor at game time was -26\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. In [[Super Bowl XXIII]], despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a [[Jim Breech]] field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock.

Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.<ref name=comeback/>\n\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, [[George Seifert]], took over as head coach. In the [[1989 NFL season]], Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\n\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|NFC championship game]], they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the [[1989 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | title=Top 10 Most Dominant Postseasons: 1989 San Francisco 49ers | date=May 28, 2012 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205233159/http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | archive-date=February 5, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131993: Unsuccessful Three-peat / Steve Young Steps in===\n[[File:SF 49ers HQ tophy wall.JPG|thumb|right|49ers wall of trophies at the Marie P.

Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] via Plan B free agency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|title=Mystery still surrounds extent of injury to Montanta's elbow|newspaper=articles.baltimoresun.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222548/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|archive-date=June 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1991 NFL season|1991]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]] helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season. The 1992 and 1993 seasons saw a resurgent 49er team under the leadership of Steve Young, but a subpar and aging defense could only take them to the NFC championship game before falling to the [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] each time.\n\nIn [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm, and started the second half of a Monday night game versus [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\n\nThe 49ers finished the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]], the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Fifth Super Bowl===\n[[File:49ers Super Bowl ring.jpg|thumb|200px|The 49ers ring for [[Super Bowl XXIX]]]]\n\nIn [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including [[Ken Norton (American football)|Ken Norton Jr.]], [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]], [[Rickey Jackson]], [[Bart Oates]], [[Richard Dent]], [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]] and [[Deion Sanders]]. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]], fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]], and linebacker [[Lee Woodall]]. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], and a 24\u201317 loss to the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen livid on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 14\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. After the hit, Young was screaming with his face dark red in color. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He miraculously returned to the field one play later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular season and post season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular season points, but only 68 post season points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular season points and 131 post season points for a total of 626, the second highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, setting up the third straight [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|49ers\u2013Cowboys NFC championship game]]. The 49ers took advantage of three early [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth [[Super Bowl XXIX|Super Bowl]] appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49er's run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s [[Vince Lombardi]] [[Green Bay Packers]] and 1970s [[Chuck Knoll]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |title=\"Little debate about who tops the best dynasties in NFL history\", ''New York Post'' |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007073741/https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |archive-date=October 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers made the playoffs in 1995 and again in 1996, being eliminated by the [[Green Bay Packers]] both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, [[George Seifert]] retired as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's retirement, the 49ers hired [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] against the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the [[Denver Broncos]], before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u201322, advancing to the [[1997\u201398 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Green Bay Packers 23, San Francisco 49ers 10|NFC championship game]] for the first time since 1994, where they again met the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\n\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding [[Louisiana]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]] and one of his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] [[casino]]s. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, [[Denise DeBartolo York|Denise]], and her husband, [[John York|Dr. John York]], took over operations of the team.\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the [[New York Jets]], a game best remembered for running back [[Garrison Hearst]]'s 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player [[Terrell Owens]], and 4th-year player [[J.J. Stokes]] became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\n\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: Atlanta Falcons 20, San Francisco 49ers 18|Divisional round]] 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Ownership change===\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chairwoman of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 49ers]] got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie [[Jeff Garcia]] took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of [[Steve Stenstrom]]. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games, and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. [[Bobb McKittrick]], 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/sports/bobb-mckittrick-64-coach-of-standout-offensive-line-for-49ers.html|title= Bobb McKittrick, 64, Coach of Standout Offensive Line for 49ers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2000|last=Litsky|first=Frank|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[2000 San Francisco 49ers season|2000 season]] Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks ([[Giovanni Carmazzi]] in the third round and [[Tim Rattay]] in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first [[Pro Bowl]] selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001 season]] the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering [[avascular necrosis]]. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. In the final 6 weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out 3 teams (the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[New Orleans Saints]]), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]] in the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#NFC: Green Bay Packers 25, San Francisco 49ers 15|NFC Wild Card]], but lost 25\u201315. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe [[2002 NFL season]] began with the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|divisional realignment]]. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]], while former divisional foes [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Carolina Panthers]] moved to the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs]] they hosted the [[New York Giants]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38|2002 NFC Wild Card]]. The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. [[Long snapper]] [[Trey Junkin]], who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder [[Matt Allen]] attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held and a reporter asked 49ers head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer.\" It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, San Francisco 49ers 6|Divisional round]], 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011\u201312 playoffs]]. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2003\u20132010: Struggles===\nThen-[[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] head coach [[Dennis Erickson]] was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42814843/reno_gazettejournal/|title=Niners Choose Erickson|newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal|location=Reno, Nevada|date=February 12, 2003|agency=Associated Press|page=B1}}</ref> The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback [[Tim Rattay]]. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. [[Dennis Erickson]] and general manager [[Terry Donahue]] were fired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Frankgore.png|thumb|left|49ers' former running back [[Frank Gore]] in action against the [[St. Louis Rams]] in 2007]]\n\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[Mike Nolan]] as their head coach. Nolan was the son of [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback [[Alex Smith (quarterback)|Alex Smith]] from the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] with the first overall pick of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product [[Aaron Rodgers]] of the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]]. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]] which they used to draft tight end [[Vernon Davis]]. [[Alex Smith]] and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second year player [[Frank Gore]] from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]]. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, [[2006 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], and kept the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Alex Smith warm up 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|49ers' former quarterback [[Alex Smith]]]]\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback [[Nate Clements]] and safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the [[2007 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker [[Patrick Willis]] with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 [[AP Defensive Rookie of the Year|AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] died of complications from [[leukemia]]. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. In the fourth game of the season, against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back up quarterback [[Trent Dilfer]]'s struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator [[Mike Martz]] stated that a competition between Smith, [[Shaun Hill]], and NFL journeyman [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach [[Mike Singletary]], a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker with the [[Chicago Bears]], was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertonement.com/clips/xjtxzdvvnb--Hit-People-in-the-Mouth|title=Mike Singletary Press Conference \"Hit-People-in-the-Mouth\"|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. [[Jed York]] is the oldest son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:49ers Offense.jpg|thumb|[[Trent Dilfer]] (#12) quarterbacks the 2007 49ers]]\n\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR [[Michael Crabtree]], a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002. Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety [[Dashon Goldson]] showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. [[Vernon Davis]] in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\n\nThe [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]] started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB [[Kurt Warner]] retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator [[Jimmy Raye II|Jimmy Raye]], who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety [[Taylor Mays]]. By mid-season, Singletary was switching QBs between [[Alex Smith]] and [[Troy Smith]], who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season, where despite crushing the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Cardinals]] 38\u20137, they finished a sad and disappointing 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs yet again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2011\u20132014: Jim Harbaugh era===\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager [[Trent Baalke]] to be the permanent general manager.

From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=49ers Unveil Classic Uniforms|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 25, 2009|access-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508021911/https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|archive-date=May 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=Morning Tailgate: Uniform Edition (April 3)|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405210202/http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3|archivedate=April 5, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 2015 at their [[2015 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]] rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design).

Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season when the AFC West and NFC West teams faced each other. So far, their rivalry has not been as intense as other division foes because for the most part both teams have not been good at the same time. In the middle to late part of the decade, the Seahawks lost the division and their favorable record against the 49ers reflected this. However, games at [[CenturyLink Field]], one of the toughest stadiums to play at as a visiting team, have still been difficult to win. The 49ers have a 3\u20137 record all-time at that stadium, with their largest margin of victory there being ten points, and failed to score a touchdown in four of those losses. The rivalry has intensified after the 49ers hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] out of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former [[University of Southern California|USC]] head coach [[Pete Carroll]] had an intense rivalry in college. Seattle leads the all-time series 20\u201315 after winning both regular season games in 2014 and taking a week 7 win at Levi's Stadium in 2015.\n\n====Arizona Cardinals====\nThe [[Arizona Cardinals]] are a recent growing rival of the 49ers. Unlike most rivalries of this team, the Arizona Cardinals are in the same division as the 49ers (since 2002, when the Cardinals transferred from the [[NFC East]]). Recently, there has been much bad blood between these two teams' players; an example of this is a Twitter \"battle\" between [[Darnell Dockett]] of the Arizona Cardinals and [[Vernon Davis]] of the San Francisco 49ers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|title=Adrian Wilson vs Vernon Davis; ROTB Announcement|publisher=Revengeofthebirds.com|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721204430/http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Another clash was when Early Doucet of the Cardinals and Dashon Goldson of the Niners threw punches at each other. The clash of words between players of both teams, added with the decline of the other major rivalries of the 49ers, either from the rarity of meeting the rival teams (49ers rarely meet the Cowboys) or the move to different cities (Los Angeles Rams moving to St. Louis), has led to the rivalry between the 49ers and the Cardinals becoming heated and intense. The 49ers hold the edge over the Cardinals all-time by 28\u201318.<ref>[http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ 49ers\u2013Cardinals pre-game notes: Lombardi says Harbaugh looks headed for Michigan; 49ers Hot Read] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714073521/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}, mercurynews.com, January 2, 2011; accessed November 27, 2014.</ref>\n\n===NFC===\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by [[Terrell Owens]] off a [[Steve Young]] pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in [[Lambeau Field]] week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201336\u20131, including a 4\u20134 postseason split.\n\n===Historic rivals===\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as '''The Catch'''), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time.\n\n====New York Giants====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\n\nThe [[New York Giants]] have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the [[Joe Montana]]-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in [[1981 NFL Season|1981]] and 21\u201310 in [[1984 NFL Season|1984]] both in the divisional round at [[Candlestick Park]]; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[1986 NFL Season|1986]], and the [[1990 NFL Season|1990 NFC championship]], where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in [[1993 NFL Season|1993]] in the divisional round.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST NFL 1993 Post-season Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506161202/http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST |date=May 6, 2019 }} NFL.com; Retrieved 6 May 2019</ref>  In the [[2002 NFL Season|2002 NFC Wildcard]] game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the [[2011 NFL Season|2011 NFC championship]] at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a [[Lawrence Tynes]] 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New Orleans Saints====\n\nAll-time record:  49\u201326\u20132 (including 1\u20130 postseason)\n\nThe [[New Orleans Saints]] were division rivals with the 49ers up until realignment in 2002 when the Saints were placed in the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The 49ers dominated the rivalry when the Saints played in the [[NFC West]], but the Saints have held the upper hand since realignment, winning the first six-game since moving to the NFC South. They met most recently in the divisional round of the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 playoffs]] at Candlestick Park. There were four lead changes in the final four minutes of the game, culminating with [[Alex Smith]] throwing the game-winning touchdown to [[Vernon Davis]] with nine seconds left (referred by many as '''Vernon Post''' or '''The Catch III'''). Three months after that game, it was revealed that then-Saints [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] ordered his players to target certain players in certain areas in a profanity-laced speech as part of the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty]] scandal prior to that game.\n\n====Atlanta Falcons====\n\nAll-time record:  47\u201332\u20131 (including 1\u20131 postseason)\n\nThe [[Atlanta Falcons]] were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment. Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs|1998 playoffs]], when [[Garrison Hearst]] suffered an ankle break when his foot was caught in the [[Georgia Dome]] turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end [[Chuck Smith (football player)|Chuck Smith]] on the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]; 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012 NFC championship]], in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the last home game at Candlestick Park. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown also known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fann|first=Joe|title=NaVorro Bowman Retires from NFL as a Member of the 49ers|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=June 4, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629081852/https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|archive-date=June 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|title=49ers Announce 2015 Schedule|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525153719/http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n====Las Vegas Raiders====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Las Vegas Raiders]] were the 49ers' geographic rivals prior to the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"battletwo\">{{cite news|title=49ers And Raiders Stagger Into Battle|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KGO-TV|date=October 7, 2006|accessdate=February 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219105318/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|archive-date=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the Raiders moved to Los Angeles]], leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23-17. Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups are at least every four years. Fans and players of the winning team can claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Michael Crabtree]], [[Tom Rathman]], and [[Charlie Garner]].\n\nThe Battle of the Bay ended tied 7 to 7. San Francisco won the last matchup 34-3 on November 1, 2018 in Week 9\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]] including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons.

The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw.

In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In [[1962 NFL season|1962]], the [[1962 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in [[1963 NFL season|1963]]. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The [[1964 NFL season|1964 season]] was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Year Book the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, [[Albert J. Ruffo]], [[Franklin Mieuli]], [[Frankie Albert]], Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The [[1965 NFL season|1965]] [[1965 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In [[1966 NFL season|1966]], the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia, team president. For the [[1968 NFL season|1968 season]], the 49ers hired as their head coach [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had been [[Tom Landry]]'s defensive coordinator with the [[Dallas Cowboys]].

Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting [[Billy Parks]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker [[Toni Fritsch]] then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by [[Mel Renfro]], giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to [[Billy Parks]] who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to [[Ron Sellers]] with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory and sending the 49ers to yet another crushing playoff defeat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran [[1973 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1973 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback [[John Brodie]] split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup [[Steve Spurrier]]. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with [[Vic Washington]] leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the 49ers drafted [[Wilbur Jackson]] from the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back [[Larry Schreiber]] combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With [[Steve Spurrier]] injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end [[Ted Kwalick]] left the 49ers to join the [[World Football League]], then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and [[Delvin Williams]] led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. [[Monte Clark]] was also brought on as 49ers head coach.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in [[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by [[Tommy Hart]]. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager [[Joe Thomas (American football executive)|Joe Thomas]], who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Meyer]] the 49ers lost their first five games of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen [[Tommy Hart]] and [[Cleveland Elam]], who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs [[Wilbur Jackson]] and [[Delvin Williams]], who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back [[O. J. Simpson]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]]. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with [[Pete McCulley]], his third coach in three seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|title=49ers Name McCulley Coach|website=washingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the [[1978 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 draft]] was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], [[Joe Montana]]'s first mentor, was the 49ers starting quarterback. Running back [[Paul Hofer]] and center/guard [[Randy Cross]] also started with the 49ers in 1978.\n\n===1979\u20131980: Arrival of Bill Walsh and Joe Montana===\n[[File:DeBartolo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of [[The DeBartolo Corporation]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]-based DeBartolo-York family.]]\n\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] and head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. The former head coach of [[Stanford University]] was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of [[Paul Brown]], and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Desiring head coach experience, Walsh looked to [[Stanford University]] in 1977. He had had some success there before the 49ers tapped him to be their replacement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the '[[West Coast offense]]'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach [[Sid Gillman]], and San Diego State coach [[Don Coryell]], who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and [[San Diego Chargers]] during a period where it garnered the nickname \"[[Coryell Offense|Air Coryell]]\".){{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]] as an early round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Fighting Irish]] to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the [[1979 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Playing the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n[[File:Joe Montana ESPN cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joe Montana]] in 2006]]\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200&nbsp;lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Danny White]], and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted [[Doug Cosbie]]. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver [[Dwight Clark]] in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of [[Clemson University]] as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into the coach's keen eye for talent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), [[Steve DeBerg]] blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and [[O.J. Simpson]], in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the early 1970s who alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]], and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the late 1940s alternating [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and [[Bob Waterfield]].\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|title=1980 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093129/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the [[New Orleans Saints]], who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by [[Joe Montana]], the 49ers made (what was then) the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] with a field goal by [[Ray Wersching]] to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were [[Dwight Clark]], who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back [[Earl Cooper (NFL)|Earl Cooper]], who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n===1981\u20131984: First two Super Bowls===\n{{See also|1981 San Francisco 49ers season|The Catch (American football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XVI]].]]\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric C. Wright|Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]] and giving [[Dwight Hicks]] a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker [[Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds]] and veteran defensive lineman and sack specialist [[Fred Dean]]. These new additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like [[Keena Turner]], turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; up to this point in time it was the team's best regular season win-loss record in its history. Dean made the [[Pro Bowl]], as did Lott, and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the [[west coast offense|short passing game]], which Walsh used as ball control. Both Dwight Clark and [[Freddie Solomon]] had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. [[Ricky Patton]] led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass-catching back. The 49ers faced the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times before, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark in the end zone, who leaped up and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (now known as \"[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. Despite this, the Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] caught a pass from Danny White and got to midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers 44-yard line by Cornerback Eric Wright saving a potential late-touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by [[Lawrence Pillers]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by [[Jim Stuckey]], giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first ever Super Bowl against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who were also in their first Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XVI]] The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker [[Ray Wersching]]'s four field goals and a key defensive stand. Throughout the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite residing in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12 play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. Thus did the 49ers complete one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season followed by a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 1982 season was a bad one for the 49ers, as they lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This was the 49ers last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Roger Craig (''middle'') and Joe Montana (''right'') led the 49ers to their second Super Bowl victory ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]) in four seasons.]]\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games of the season, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and winning their 2nd NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season, passing for 3,910 yards and connecting on 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, they hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped out in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]] on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 left on the clock to put the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when a potential game-winning FG attempt by Lions kicker [[Eddie Murray (American football)|Eddie Murray]] missed. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the NFC championship game to tie the game, only to lose, after a questionable defensive holding call, 24\u201321 on a Mark Moseley field goal that sent the Redskins to [[Super Bowl XVIII]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 [[Chicago Bears]], the 1998 [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 2004 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the 2011 [[Green Bay Packers]] and finally broken by the 2007 [[New England Patriots]] (with 16 regular season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (they won 18 straight, but lost [[Super Bowl XLII]] to the [[New York Giants]]). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker [[Ray Wersching]] went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the [[New York Giants]] 21\u201310, shut out the [[Chicago Bears]] 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in [[Super Bowl XIX]] the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP [[Dan Marino]] (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\n===1985\u20131987: Arrival of Jerry Rice===\nIn the [[1985 NFL Draft]], the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected [[Jerry Rice]] from [[Mississippi Valley State University|Mississippi Valley State]]. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the [[New York Giants]] 17\u20133.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|title=Giants Stop 49ers in Wild-Card Playoff, 17-3|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=December 30, 1985|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813060009/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the [[injured reserve list]], [[Jeff Kemp]] became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]], to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]]. However, the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date.

During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving and/or touchdown receptions, he was named [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24|NFC divisional round]], losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] team, their third straight playoff loss in a row. Joe Montana had one of his worst post-season games of his career, and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo]] stripped Walsh of the team president title.

Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the [[1988 NFL season]], the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, [[Ronnie Lott]] called a players-only meeting; after the meeting the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1988 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] for the NFC championship against the [[Chicago Bears]], where the wind chill factor at game time was -26\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. In [[Super Bowl XXIII]], despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a [[Jim Breech]] field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle [[Harris Barton]], during a television timeout, \"hey, there's [[John Candy]]\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field.<ref name=comeback>{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | title=Montana was comeback king | work=[[ESPN.com]] | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | accessdate=August 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809043825/http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | archive-date=August 9, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super bowl championship with a score of 20\u201316. Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.<ref name=comeback/>\n\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, [[George Seifert]], took over as head coach. In the [[1989 NFL season]], Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\n\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|NFC championship game]], they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the [[1989 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | title=Top 10 Most Dominant Postseasons: 1989 San Francisco 49ers | date=May 28, 2012 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205233159/http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | archive-date=February 5, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131993: Unsuccessful Three-peat / Steve Young Steps in===\n[[File:SF 49ers HQ tophy wall.JPG|thumb|right|49ers wall of trophies at the Marie P.

Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] via Plan B free agency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|title=Mystery still surrounds extent of injury to Montanta's elbow|newspaper=articles.baltimoresun.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222548/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|archive-date=June 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1991 NFL season|1991]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]] helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season. The 1992 and 1993 seasons saw a resurgent 49er team under the leadership of Steve Young, but a subpar and aging defense could only take them to the NFC championship game before falling to the [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] each time.\n\nIn [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm, and started the second half of a Monday night game versus [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\n\nThe 49ers finished the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]], the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Fifth Super Bowl===\n[[File:49ers Super Bowl ring.jpg|thumb|200px|The 49ers ring for [[Super Bowl XXIX]]]]\n\nIn [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including [[Ken Norton (American football)|Ken Norton Jr.]], [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]], [[Rickey Jackson]], [[Bart Oates]], [[Richard Dent]], [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]] and [[Deion Sanders]]. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]], fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]], and linebacker [[Lee Woodall]]. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], and a 24\u201317 loss to the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen livid on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 14\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. After the hit, Young was screaming with his face dark red in color. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He miraculously returned to the field one play later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular season and post season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular season points, but only 68 post season points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular season points and 131 post season points for a total of 626, the second highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, setting up the third straight [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|49ers\u2013Cowboys NFC championship game]]. The 49ers took advantage of three early [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth [[Super Bowl XXIX|Super Bowl]] appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49er's run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s [[Vince Lombardi]] [[Green Bay Packers]] and 1970s [[Chuck Knoll]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |title=\"Little debate about who tops the best dynasties in NFL history\", ''New York Post'' |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007073741/https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |archive-date=October 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers made the playoffs in 1995 and again in 1996, being eliminated by the [[Green Bay Packers]] both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, [[George Seifert]] retired as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's retirement, the 49ers hired [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] against the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the [[Denver Broncos]], before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u201322, advancing to the [[1997\u201398 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Green Bay Packers 23, San Francisco 49ers 10|NFC championship game]] for the first time since 1994, where they again met the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\n\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding [[Louisiana]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]] and one of his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] [[casino]]s. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, [[Denise DeBartolo York|Denise]], and her husband, [[John York|Dr. John York]], took over operations of the team.\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the [[New York Jets]], a game best remembered for running back [[Garrison Hearst]]'s 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player [[Terrell Owens]], and 4th-year player [[J.J. Stokes]] became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\n\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: Atlanta Falcons 20, San Francisco 49ers 18|Divisional round]] 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Ownership change===\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chairwoman of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 49ers]] got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie [[Jeff Garcia]] took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of [[Steve Stenstrom]]. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games, and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. [[Bobb McKittrick]], 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/sports/bobb-mckittrick-64-coach-of-standout-offensive-line-for-49ers.html|title= Bobb McKittrick, 64, Coach of Standout Offensive Line for 49ers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2000|last=Litsky|first=Frank|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[2000 San Francisco 49ers season|2000 season]] Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks ([[Giovanni Carmazzi]] in the third round and [[Tim Rattay]] in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first [[Pro Bowl]] selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001 season]] the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering [[avascular necrosis]]. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. In the final 6 weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out 3 teams (the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[New Orleans Saints]]), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]] in the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#NFC: Green Bay Packers 25, San Francisco 49ers 15|NFC Wild Card]], but lost 25\u201315. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe [[2002 NFL season]] began with the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|divisional realignment]]. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]], while former divisional foes [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Carolina Panthers]] moved to the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs]] they hosted the [[New York Giants]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38|2002 NFC Wild Card]]. The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. [[Long snapper]] [[Trey Junkin]], who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder [[Matt Allen]] attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held and a reporter asked 49ers head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer.\" It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, San Francisco 49ers 6|Divisional round]], 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011\u201312 playoffs]]. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2003\u20132010: Struggles===\nThen-[[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] head coach [[Dennis Erickson]] was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42814843/reno_gazettejournal/|title=Niners Choose Erickson|newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal|location=Reno, Nevada|date=February 12, 2003|agency=Associated Press|page=B1}}</ref> The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback [[Tim Rattay]]. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. [[Dennis Erickson]] and general manager [[Terry Donahue]] were fired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Frankgore.png|thumb|left|49ers' former running back [[Frank Gore]] in action against the [[St. Louis Rams]] in 2007]]\n\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[Mike Nolan]] as their head coach. Nolan was the son of [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback [[Alex Smith (quarterback)|Alex Smith]] from the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] with the first overall pick of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product [[Aaron Rodgers]] of the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]]. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]] which they used to draft tight end [[Vernon Davis]]. [[Alex Smith]] and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second year player [[Frank Gore]] from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]]. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, [[2006 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], and kept the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Alex Smith warm up 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|49ers' former quarterback [[Alex Smith]]]]\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback [[Nate Clements]] and safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the [[2007 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker [[Patrick Willis]] with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 [[AP Defensive Rookie of the Year|AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] died of complications from [[leukemia]]. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. In the fourth game of the season, against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back up quarterback [[Trent Dilfer]]'s struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator [[Mike Martz]] stated that a competition between Smith, [[Shaun Hill]], and NFL journeyman [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach [[Mike Singletary]], a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker with the [[Chicago Bears]], was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertonement.com/clips/xjtxzdvvnb--Hit-People-in-the-Mouth|title=Mike Singletary Press Conference \"Hit-People-in-the-Mouth\"|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. [[Jed York]] is the oldest son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:49ers Offense.jpg|thumb|[[Trent Dilfer]] (#12) quarterbacks the 2007 49ers]]\n\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR [[Michael Crabtree]], a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002. Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety [[Dashon Goldson]] showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. [[Vernon Davis]] in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\n\nThe [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]] started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB [[Kurt Warner]] retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator [[Jimmy Raye II|Jimmy Raye]], who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety [[Taylor Mays]]. By mid-season, Singletary was switching QBs between [[Alex Smith]] and [[Troy Smith]], who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season, where despite crushing the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Cardinals]] 38\u20137, they finished a sad and disappointing 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs yet again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2011\u20132014: Jim Harbaugh era===\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager [[Trent Baalke]] to be the permanent general manager.

From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=49ers Unveil Classic Uniforms|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 25, 2009|access-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508021911/https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|archive-date=May 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=Morning Tailgate: Uniform Edition (April 3)|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405210202/http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3|archivedate=April 5, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 2015 at their [[2015 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]] rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design).

Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season when the AFC West and NFC West teams faced each other. So far, their rivalry has not been as intense as other division foes because for the most part both teams have not been good at the same time. In the middle to late part of the decade, the Seahawks lost the division and their favorable record against the 49ers reflected this. However, games at [[CenturyLink Field]], one of the toughest stadiums to play at as a visiting team, have still been difficult to win. The 49ers have a 3\u20137 record all-time at that stadium, with their largest margin of victory there being ten points, and failed to score a touchdown in four of those losses. The rivalry has intensified after the 49ers hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] out of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former [[University of Southern California|USC]] head coach [[Pete Carroll]] had an intense rivalry in college. Seattle leads the all-time series 20\u201315 after winning both regular season games in 2014 and taking a week 7 win at Levi's Stadium in 2015.\n\n====Arizona Cardinals====\nThe [[Arizona Cardinals]] are a recent growing rival of the 49ers. Unlike most rivalries of this team, the Arizona Cardinals are in the same division as the 49ers (since 2002, when the Cardinals transferred from the [[NFC East]]). Recently, there has been much bad blood between these two teams' players; an example of this is a Twitter \"battle\" between [[Darnell Dockett]] of the Arizona Cardinals and [[Vernon Davis]] of the San Francisco 49ers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|title=Adrian Wilson vs Vernon Davis; ROTB Announcement|publisher=Revengeofthebirds.com|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721204430/http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Another clash was when Early Doucet of the Cardinals and Dashon Goldson of the Niners threw punches at each other. The clash of words between players of both teams, added with the decline of the other major rivalries of the 49ers, either from the rarity of meeting the rival teams (49ers rarely meet the Cowboys) or the move to different cities (Los Angeles Rams moving to St. Louis), has led to the rivalry between the 49ers and the Cardinals becoming heated and intense. The 49ers hold the edge over the Cardinals all-time by 28\u201318.<ref>[http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ 49ers\u2013Cardinals pre-game notes: Lombardi says Harbaugh looks headed for Michigan; 49ers Hot Read] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714073521/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}, mercurynews.com, January 2, 2011; accessed November 27, 2014.</ref>\n\n===NFC===\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by [[Terrell Owens]] off a [[Steve Young]] pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in [[Lambeau Field]] week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201336\u20131, including a 4\u20134 postseason split.\n\n===Historic rivals===\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as '''The Catch'''), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time.\n\n====New York Giants====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\n\nThe [[New York Giants]] have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the [[Joe Montana]]-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in [[1981 NFL Season|1981]] and 21\u201310 in [[1984 NFL Season|1984]] both in the divisional round at [[Candlestick Park]]; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[1986 NFL Season|1986]], and the [[1990 NFL Season|1990 NFC championship]], where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in [[1993 NFL Season|1993]] in the divisional round.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST NFL 1993 Post-season Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506161202/http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST |date=May 6, 2019 }} NFL.com; Retrieved 6 May 2019</ref>  In the [[2002 NFL Season|2002 NFC Wildcard]] game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the [[2011 NFL Season|2011 NFC championship]] at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a [[Lawrence Tynes]] 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New Orleans Saints====\n\nAll-time record:  49\u201326\u20132 (including 1\u20130 postseason)\n\nThe [[New Orleans Saints]] were division rivals with the 49ers up until realignment in 2002 when the Saints were placed in the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The 49ers dominated the rivalry when the Saints played in the [[NFC West]], but the Saints have held the upper hand since realignment, winning the first six-game since moving to the NFC South. They met most recently in the divisional round of the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 playoffs]] at Candlestick Park. There were four lead changes in the final four minutes of the game, culminating with [[Alex Smith]] throwing the game-winning touchdown to [[Vernon Davis]] with nine seconds left (referred by many as '''Vernon Post''' or '''The Catch III'''). Three months after that game, it was revealed that then-Saints [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] ordered his players to target certain players in certain areas in a profanity-laced speech as part of the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty]] scandal prior to that game.\n\n====Atlanta Falcons====\n\nAll-time record:  47\u201332\u20131 (including 1\u20131 postseason)\n\nThe [[Atlanta Falcons]] were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment. Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs|1998 playoffs]], when [[Garrison Hearst]] suffered an ankle break when his foot was caught in the [[Georgia Dome]] turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end [[Chuck Smith (football player)|Chuck Smith]] on the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]; 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012 NFC championship]], in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the last home game at Candlestick Park. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown also known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fann|first=Joe|title=NaVorro Bowman Retires from NFL as a Member of the 49ers|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=June 4, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629081852/https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|archive-date=June 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|title=49ers Announce 2015 Schedule|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525153719/http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n====Las Vegas Raiders====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Las Vegas Raiders]] were the 49ers' geographic rivals prior to the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"battletwo\">{{cite news|title=49ers And Raiders Stagger Into Battle|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KGO-TV|date=October 7, 2006|accessdate=February 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219105318/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|archive-date=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the Raiders moved to Los Angeles]], leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23-17. Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups are at least every four years. Fans and players of the winning team can claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Michael Crabtree]], [[Tom Rathman]], and [[Charlie Garner]].\n\nThe Battle of the Bay ended tied 7 to 7. San Francisco won the last matchup 34-3 on November 1, 2018 in Week 9\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]] including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons.
